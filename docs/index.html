<p>by Samuel R. Bray, Bo Wang</p>

Forecasting ‘Black Swan’ events in ecosystems is an important but challenging task. Many ecosystems display aperiodic fluctuations in species abundance spanning orders of magnitude in scale, which have vast environmental and economic impact. Empirical evidence and theoretical analyses suggest that these dynamics are in a regime where system nonlinearities limit accurate forecasting of unprecedented events due to poor extrapolation of historical data to unsampled states. Leveraging increasingly available long-term high-frequency ecological tracking data, we analyze multiple natural and experimental ecosystems (marine plankton, intertidal mollusks, and deciduous forest), and recover hidden linearity embedded in universal ‘scaling laws’ of species dynamics. We then develop a method using these scaling laws to reduce data dependence in ecological forecasting and accurately predict extreme events beyond the span of historical observations in diverse ecosystems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bc3qP0k4v_Y" width="1" />

<p>by Ethan D. Evans, Chengzhen Dai, Siavash Isazadeh, Shinkyu Park, Carlo Ratti, Eric J. Alm</p>

Direct sampling of building wastewater has the potential to enable “precision public health” observations and interventions. Temporal sampling offers additional dynamic information that can be used to increase the informational content of individual metabolic “features”, but few studies have focused on high-resolution sampling. Here, we sampled three spatially close buildings, revealing individual metabolomics features, retention time (rt) and mass-to-charge ratio (mz) pairs, that often possess similar stationary statistical properties, as expected from aggregate sampling. However, the temporal profiles of features—providing orthogonal information to physicochemical properties—illustrate that many possess different <i>feature temporal dynamics</i> (fTDs) across buildings, with large and unpredictable single day deviations from the mean. Internal to a building, numerous and seemingly unrelated features, with mz and rt differences up to hundreds of Daltons and seconds, display highly correlated fTDs, suggesting non-obvious feature relationships. Data-driven building classification achieves high sensitivity and specificity, and extracts building-identifying features found to possess unique dynamics. Analysis of fTDs from many short-duration samples allows for tailored community monitoring with applicability in public health studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CS3tfz-Ww-Y" width="1" />

<p>by Nimrod Sherf, Shamir Maoz</p>

Rhythmic activity has been associated with a wide range of cognitive processes including the encoding of sensory information, navigation, the transfer of information and others. Rhythmic activity in the brain has also been suggested to be used for multiplexing information. Multiplexing is the ability to transmit more than one signal via the same channel. Here we focus on frequency division multiplexing, in which different signals are transmitted in different frequency bands. Recent work showed that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can facilitate the transfer of rhythmic activity downstream the information processing pathway. However, STDP has also been known to generate strong winner-take-all like competition between subgroups of correlated synaptic inputs. This competition between different rhythmicity channels, induced by STDP, may prevent the multiplexing of information. Thus, raising doubts whether STDP is consistent with the idea of multiplexing. This study explores whether STDP can facilitate the multiplexing of information across multiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We address this question in a modelling study, investigating the STDP dynamics of two populations synapsing downstream onto the same neuron in a feed-forward manner. Each population was assumed to exhibit rhythmic activity, albeit in a different frequency band. Our theory reveals that the winner-take-all like competitions between the two populations is limited, in the sense that different rhythmic populations will not necessarily fully suppress each other. Furthermore, we found that for a wide range of parameters, the network converged to a solution in which the downstream neuron responded to both rhythms. Yet, the synaptic weights themselves did not converge to a fixed point, rather remained dynamic. These findings imply that STDP can support the multiplexing of rhythmic information, and demonstrate how functionality (multiplexing of information) can be retained in the face of continuous remodeling of all the synaptic weights. The constraints on the types of STDP rules that can support multiplexing provide a natural test for our theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MfBafRnagZY" width="1" />

<p>by Mikkel Herholdt Jensen, Eliza J. Morris, Hai Tran, Michael A. Nash, Cheemeng Tan</p>

Top-down proteomics has enabled the elucidation of heterogeneous protein complexes with different cofactors, post-translational modifications, and protein membership. This heterogeneity is believed to play a previously unknown role in cellular processes. The different molecular forms of a protein complex have come to be called “complex isoform” or “complexoform”. Despite the elucidation of the complexoform, it remains unclear how and whether cellular circuits control the distribution of a complexoform. To help address this issue, we first simulate a generic three-protein complexoform to reveal the control of its distribution by the timing of gene transcription, mRNA translation, and protein transport. Overall, we ran 265 computational experiments: each averaged over 1,000 stochastic simulations. Based on the experiments, we show that genes arranged in a single operon, a cascade, or as two operons all give rise to the different protein composition of complexoform because of timing differences in protein-synthesis order. We also show that changes in the kinetics of expression, protein transport, or protein binding dramatically alter the distribution of the complexoform. Furthermore, both stochastic and transient kinetics control the assembly of the complexoform when the expression and assembly occur concurrently. We test our model against the biological cellulosome system. With biologically relevant rates, we find that the genetic circuitry controls the average final complexoform assembly and the variation in the assembly structure. Our results highlight the importance of both the genetic circuit architecture and kinetics in determining the distribution of a complexoform. Our work has a broad impact on our understanding of non-equilibrium processes in both living and synthetic biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rOpI0sFUV9k" width="1" />

<p>by Niklas Korsbo, Henrik Jönsson</p>

Thoughtful use of simplifying assumptions is crucial to make systems biology models tractable while still representative of the underlying biology. A useful simplification can elucidate the core dynamics of a system. A poorly chosen assumption can, however, either render a model too complicated for making conclusions or it can prevent an otherwise accurate model from describing experimentally observed dynamics. Here, we perform a computational investigation of sequential multi-step pathway models that contain fewer pathway steps than the system they are designed to emulate. We demonstrate when such models will fail to reproduce data and how detrimental truncation of a pathway leads to detectable signatures in model dynamics and its optimised parameters. An alternative assumption is suggested for simplifying such pathways. Rather than assuming a truncated number of pathway steps, we propose to use the assumption that the rates of information propagation along the pathway is homogeneous and, instead, letting the length of the pathway be a free parameter. We first focus on linear pathways that are sequential and have first-order kinetics, and we show how this assumption results in a three-parameter model that consistently outperforms its truncated rival and a delay differential equation alternative in recapitulating observed dynamics. We then show how the proposed assumption allows for similarly terse and effective models of non-linear pathways. Our results provide a foundation for well-informed decision making during model simplifications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dQUudZqyIp4" width="1" />

<p>by Shintaro Nagata, Macoto Kikuchi</p>

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex systems in which many genes regulate mutually to adapt the cell state to environmental conditions. In addition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds of robustness. This robustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed to disturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels in living systems. Both function and robustness have been acquired through evolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized in living systems are rare among all possible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape of GRNs and investigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy model of GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the expression level of the output gene between two input states, “on” and “off”, was considered as fitness. Thus, the determination of the fitness of a GRN was based on how sensitively it responded to the input. We employed the multicanonical Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide range of fitness levels, and classified the GRNs according to their fitness. As a result, the following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited bistability for intermediate input between “on” and “off”. This means that such GRNs responded to two input states by using different fixed points of dynamics. This bistability emerges necessarily as fitness increases. (2) These highly-fit GRNs were robust against noise because of their bistability. In other words, noise robustness is a byproduct of high fitness. (3) GRNs that were robust against mutations were not extremely rare among the highly-fit GRNs. This implies that mutational robustness is readily acquired through the evolutionary process. These properties are universal irrespective of the evolutionary pathway, because the results do not rely on evolutionary simulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I8GcWQMJSQI" width="1" />

<p>by Jens Karschau, André Scholich, Jonathan Wise, Hernán Morales-Navarrete, Yannis Kalaidzidis, Marino Zerial, Benjamin M. Friedrich</p>

Can three-dimensional, microvasculature networks still ensure blood supply if individual links fail? We address this question in the sinusoidal network, a plexus-like microvasculature network, which transports nutrient-rich blood to every hepatocyte in liver tissue, by building on recent advances in high-resolution imaging and digital reconstruction of adult mice liver tissue. We find that the topology of the three-dimensional sinusoidal network reflects its two design requirements of a space-filling network that connects all hepatocytes, while using shortest transport routes: sinusoidal networks are sub-graphs of the Delaunay graph of their set of branching points, and also contain the corresponding minimum spanning tree, both to good approximation. To overcome the spatial limitations of experimental samples and generate arbitrarily-sized networks, we developed a network generation algorithm that reproduces the statistical features of 0.3-mm-sized samples of sinusoidal networks, using multi-objective optimization for node degree and edge length distribution. Nematic order in these simulated networks implies anisotropic transport properties, characterized by an empirical linear relation between a nematic order parameter and the anisotropy of the permeability tensor. Under the assumption that all sinusoid tubes have a constant and equal flow resistance, we predict that the distribution of currents in the network is very inhomogeneous, with a small number of edges carrying a substantial part of the flow—a feature known for hierarchical networks, but unexpected for plexus-like networks. We quantify network resilience in terms of a permeability-at-risk, i.e., permeability as function of the fraction of removed edges. We find that sinusoidal networks are resilient to random removal of edges, but vulnerable to the removal of high-current edges. Our findings suggest the existence of a mechanism counteracting flow inhomogeneity to balance metabolic load on the liver.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6f0FHErCdAA" width="1" />

<p>by A. Armean Wright, Ghassan N. Fayad, James F. Selgrade, Mette S. Olufsen</p>

Contraceptive drugs intended for family planning are used by the majority of married or in-union women in almost all regions of the world. The two most prevalent types of hormones associated with contraception are synthetic estrogens and progestins. Hormonal based contraceptives contain a dose of a synthetic progesterone (progestin) or a combination of a progestin and a synthetic estrogen. In this study we use mathematical modeling to understand better how these contraceptive paradigms prevent ovulation, special focus is on understanding how changes in dose impact hormonal cycling. To explain this phenomenon, we added two autocrine mechanisms essential to achieve contraception within our previous menstrual cycle models. This new model predicts mean daily blood concentrations of key hormones during a contraceptive state achieved by administering progestins, synthetic estrogens, or a combined treatment. Model outputs are compared with data from two clinical trials: one for a progestin only treatment and one for a combined hormonal treatment. Results show that contraception can be achieved with synthetic estrogen, with progestin, and by combining the two hormones. An advantage of the combined treatment is that a contraceptive state can be obtained at a lower dose of each hormone. The model studied here is qualitative in nature, but can be coupled with a pharmacokinetic/pharamacodynamic (PKPD) model providing the ability to fit exogenous inputs to specific bioavailability and affinity. A model of this type may allow insight into a specific drug’s effects, which has potential to be useful in the pre-clinical trial stage identifying the lowest dose required to achieve contraception.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/29_Xe7xXoGM" width="1" />

<p>by Stefanie Duvigneau, Robert Dürr, Tanja Laske, Mandy Bachmann, Melanie Dostert, Achim Kienle</p>

A large group of biopharmaceuticals is produced in cell lines. The yield of such products can be increased by genetic engineering of the corresponding cell lines. The prediction of promising genetic modifications by mathematical modeling is a valuable tool to facilitate experimental screening. Besides information on the intracellular kinetics and genetic modifications the mathematical model has to account for ubiquitous cell-to-cell variability. In this contribution, we establish a novel model-based methodology for influenza vaccine production in cell lines with overexpressed genes. The manipulation of the expression level of genes coding for host cell factors relevant for virus replication is achieved by lentiviral transduction. Since lentiviral transduction causes increased cell-to-cell variability due to different copy numbers and integration sites of the gene constructs we use a population balance modeling approach to account for this heterogeneity in terms of intracellular viral components and distributed kinetic parameters. The latter are estimated from experimental data of intracellular viral RNA levels and virus titers of infection experiments using cells overexpressing a single host cell gene. For experiments with cells overexpressing multiple host cell genes, only final virus titers were measured and thus, no direct estimation of the parameter distributions was possible. Instead, we evaluate four different computational strategies to infer these from single gene parameter sets. Finally, the best computational strategy is used to predict the most promising candidates for future modifications that show the highest potential for an increased virus yield in a combinatorial study. As expected, there is a trend to higher yields the more modifications are included.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PqCa9sFckj4" width="1" />

<p>by Qing Yu, Chunyue Teng, Bradley R. Postle</p>

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural codes for representing stimulus information held in different states of priority in working memory. Human participants (male and female) performed delayed recall for 2 oriented gratings that could appear in any of several locations. Priority status was manipulated by a retrocue, such that one became the prioritized memory item (PMI) and another the unprioritized memory item (UMI). Using inverted encoding models (IEMs), we found that, in early visual cortex, the orientation of the UMI was represented in a neural representation that was rotated relative to the PMI. In intraparietal sulcus (IPS), we observed the analogous effect for the representation of the location of the UMI. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a common remapping mechanism that may be responsible for representing stimulus identity and stimulus context with different levels of priority in working memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tKP8cWRAlOc" width="1" />

<p>Recognition of every word is accomplished by close collaboration of bottom-up
sub-word and word recognition neural networks with top-down cognitive word
context expectations. The utility of this context appropriate collaboration is
substantial savings in recognition time, accuracy and cortical neural
processing resources. Repetition priming, the simplest form of context
facilitation, has been studied extensively, but behavioral and cognitive
neuroscience research has failed to produce a common shared model. Facilitation
is attributed to temporary lowered word recognition thresholds. Recent fMRI
evidence identifies frontal, prefrontal, left temporal cortex interactions as
the source of this priming bias. Five experiments presented here clearly
demonstrate that word recognition facilitation is a bias effect. Context-Biased
Fast Accurate Recognition, a recurrent neural network model, shows how this
anticipatory bias is accomplished by interactions among top-down conceptual
cognitive networks and bottom-up lexical word recognition networks. Signal
detection theory says that this facilitation bias is offset by the cost of
miss-recognizing similar, but different words. However, the prime typically
creates a temporary time-space recognition window within which probability of
prime recurrence is substantially raised paradoxically transforming bias into
sensitivity.

<p>Cue integration, the combination of different sources of information to
reduce uncertainty, is a fundamental computational principle of brain function.
Starting from a normative model we show that the dynamics of multi-compartment
neurons with conductance-based dendrites naturally implement the required
probabilistic computations. The associated error-driven plasticity rule allows
neurons to learn the relative reliability of different pathways from data
samples, approximating Bayes-optimal observers in multisensory integration
tasks. Additionally, the model provides a functional interpretation of neural
recordings from multisensory integration experiments and makes specific
predictions for membrane potential and conductance dynamics of individual
neurons.

<p>Connectionist models such as neural networks suffer from catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we study this problem from the perspective of
information theory and define forgetting as the increase of description lengths
of previous data when they are compressed with a sequentially learned model. In
addition, we show that continual learning approaches based on variational
posterior approximation and generative replay can be considered as
approximations to two prequential coding methods in compression, namely, the
Bayesian mixture code and maximum likelihood (ML) plug-in code. We compare
these approaches in terms of both compression and forgetting and empirically
study the reasons that limit the performance of continual learning methods
based on variational posterior approximation. To address these limitations, we
propose a new continual learning method that combines ML plug-in and Bayesian
mixture codes.

<p>We consider the Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning (EBC) in the cerebellum via
repeated presentation of paired conditioned stimulus (tone) and unconditioned
stimulus (airpuff), and investigate the effect of diverse temporal recoding of
granule (GR) cells on the EBC by varying the connection probability $p_c$ from
Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal value of $p_c^*~(=0.029)$, individual GR
cells exhibit diverse spiking patterns which are well- or ill-matched with the
unconditioned stimulus. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via
parallel-fibers (PFs) from the GR cells are effectively depressed by the
error-teaching signals via climbing fibers (CFs) from the inferior olive.
Synaptic weights at well-matched PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses of active GR
cells are strongly depressed via strong long-term depression (LTD), while
practically no LTD occurs at ill-matched PF-PC synapses. This kind of
"effective" depression at PF-PC synapses coordinates firings of PCs
effectively, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on cerebellar
nucleus neuron [which evokes conditioned response (CR; eyeblink)]. When the
learning trial passes a threshold, acquisition of CR begins. In this case, the
timing degree ${\cal T}_d$ of CR becomes good due to presence of ill-matched
spiking group which plays a role of protection barrier for the timing. With
further increase in the trial, strength $\cal S$ of CR increases due to strong
LTD in the well-matched spiking group. Thus, the learning efficiency degree
${\cal L}_e$ (taking into consideration both timing and strength of CR) for the
CR increases with learning trial, and eventually it becomes saturated. By
changing $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we also investigate the effect of diverse spiking
patterns of GR cells on the EBC. It is this found that, the more diverse in
temporal recoding of GR cells, the more effective in motor learning for the
Pavlovian EBC.

<p>This study proposes a novel biologically plausible mechanism for generating
low-dimensional spike-based text representation. First, we demonstrate how to
transform documents into series of spikes spike trains which are subsequently
used as input in the training process of a spiking neural network (SNN). The
network is composed of biologically plausible elements, and trained according
to the unsupervised Hebbian learning rule, Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP). After training, the SNN can be used to generate low-dimensional
spike-based text representation suitable for text/document classification.
Empirical results demonstrate that the generated text representation may be
effectively used in text classification leading to an accuracy of $80.19\%$ on
the bydate version of the 20 newsgroups data set, which is a leading result
amongst approaches that rely on low-dimensional text representations.

<p>The full loss of thrust of an aircraft requires fast and reliable decisions
of the pilot. If no published landing field is within reach, an emergency
landing field must be selected. The choice of a suitable emergency landing
field denotes a crucial task to avoid unnecessary damage of the aircraft, risk
for the civil population as well as the crew and all passengers on board.
Especially in case of instrument meteorological conditions it is indispensable
to use a database of suitable emergency landing fields. Thus, based on public
available digital orthographic photos and digital surface models, we created
various datasets with different sample sizes to facilitate training and testing
of neural networks. Each dataset consists of a set of data layers. The best
compositions of these data layers as well as the best performing transfer
learning models are selected. Subsequently, certain hyperparameters of the
chosen models for each sample size are optimized with Bayesian and Bandit
optimization. The hyperparameter tuning is performed with a self-made
Kubernetes cluster. The models outputs were investigated with respect to the
input data by the utilization of layer-wise relevance propagation. With
optimized models we created an ensemble model to improve the segmentation
performance. Finally, an area around the airport of Arnsberg in North
Rhine-Westphalia was segmented and emergency landing fields are identified,
while the verification of the final approach's obstacle clearance is left
unconsidered. These emergency landing fields are stored in a PostgreSQL
database.

<p>How does the human brain learn new concepts from raw sensory experience,
without explicit instruction? We still do not have a widely-accepted answer to
this central question. Here, we propose a detailed biological mechanism for the
widely-embraced idea that learning is based on the differences between
predictions and actual outcomes (i.e., predictive error-driven learning).
Specifically, numerous weak projections into the pulvinar nucleus of the
thalamus generate top-down predictions, and sparse, focal driver inputs from
lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating in layer 5 intrinsic
bursting (5IB) neurons. Thus, the outcome is only briefly activated, roughly
every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal difference error
signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the neocortex, resulting
in a biologically-plausible form of error backpropagation learning. We
implemented these mechanisms in a large-scale model of the visual system, and
found that the simulated inferotemporal (IT) pathway learns to systematically
categorize 3D objects according to invariant shape properties, based solely on
predictive learning from raw visual inputs. These categories match human
judgments on the same stimuli, and are consistent with neural representations
in IT cortex in primates.

<p>This paper describes a scalable active learning pipeline prototype for
large-scale brain mapping that leverages high performance computing power. It
enables high-throughput evaluation of algorithm results, which, after human
review, are used for iterative machine learning model training. Image
processing and machine learning are performed in a batch layer. Benchmark
testing of image processing using pMATLAB shows that a 100$\times$ increase in
throughput (10,000%) can be achieved while total processing time only increases
by 9% on Xeon-G6 CPUs and by 22% on Xeon-E5 CPUs, indicating robust
scalability. The images and algorithm results are provided through a serving
layer to a browser-based user interface for interactive review. This pipeline
has the potential to greatly reduce the manual annotation burden and improve
the overall performance of machine learning-based brain mapping.

<p>Boolean circuits of McCulloch-Pitts threshold gates are a classic model of
neural computation studied heavily in the late 20th century as a model of
general computation. Recent advances in large-scale neural computing hardware
has made their practical implementation a near-term possibility. We describe a
theoretical approach for multiplying two $N$ by $N$ matrices that integrates
threshold gate logic with conventional fast matrix multiplication algorithms,
that perform $O(N^\omega)$ arithmetic operations for a positive constant
$\omega &lt; 3$. Our approach converts such a fast matrix multiplication algorithm
into a constant-depth threshold circuit with approximately $O(N^\omega)$ gates.
Prior to our work, it was not known whether the $\Theta(N^3)$-gate barrier for
matrix multiplication was surmountable by constant-depth threshold circuits.
</p>
<p>Dense matrix multiplication is a core operation in convolutional neural
network training. Performing this work on a neural architecture instead of
off-loading it to a GPU may be an appealing option.

<p>Neural oscillations represent a fundamental mechanism that enables coordinated action during normal brain functioning. Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are used to test the ability to generate gamma-range activity. Different non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to modulate neural activation patterns that are aberrant in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on how different methods of NIBS (transcranial altering current stimulation—tACS, transcranial direct current stimulation—tDCS, transcranial random noise stimulation—tRNS, paired associative stimulation—PAS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation—rTMS) affect the gamma-range ASSRs in both healthy and clinical populations. We show that the current research has been far from systematic and methodologically heterogeneous. Nevertheless, some brain stimulation techniques, especially tACS and rTMS show strong potential for further exploration. We outline the main findings and provide directions for further research into neuromodulation of ASSRs as a promising biomarker of different psychopathological conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58066">The Role of Rif1 in telomere length regulation is separable from its role in origin firing</a></h4>

To examine the established link between DNA replication and telomere length, we tested whether firing of telomeric origins would cause telomere lengthening. We found that <i>RIF1</i> mutants that block Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding activated telomeric origins but did not elongate telomeres. In a second approach, we found overexpression of ∆N-Dbf4 and Cdc7 increased DDK activity and activated telomeric origins, yet telomere length was unchanged. We tested a third mechanism to activate origins using the <i>sld3-A mcm5-bob1 </i>mutant that de-regulates the pre-replication complex, and again saw no change in telomere length. Finally, we tested whether mutations in <i>RIF1</i> that cause telomere elongation would affect origin firing. We found that neither <i>rif1-∆1322 </i>nor <i>rif1<sub>HOOK</sub></i> affected firing of telomeric origins. We conclude that telomeric origin firing does not cause telomere elongation, and the role of Rif1 in regulating origin firing is separable from its role in regulating telomere length.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57627">Tetramerisation of the CRISPR ring nuclease Crn3/Csx3 facilitates cyclic oligoadenylate cleavage</a></h4>

Type III CRISPR systems detect foreign RNA and activate the cyclase domain of the Cas10 subunit, generating cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules that act as a second messenger to signal infection, activating nucleases that degrade the nucleic acid of both invader and host. This can lead to dormancy or cell death; to avoid this, cells need a way to remove cOA from the cell once a viral infection has been defeated. Enzymes specialised for this task are known as ring nucleases, but are limited in their distribution. Here, we demonstrate that the widespread CRISPR associated protein Csx3, previously described as an RNA deadenylase, is a ring nuclease that rapidly degrades cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA<sub>4</sub>). The enzyme has an unusual cooperative reaction mechanism involving an active site that spans the interface between two dimers, sandwiching the cA<sub>4</sub> substrate. We propose the name Crn3 (CRISPR associated ring nuclease 3) for the Csx3 family.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56720">CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in keratinocytes induces TNF-dependent skin and systemic inflammation</a></h4>

To investigate how the <i>CARD14</i><sup>E138A</sup> psoriasis-associated mutation induces skin inflammation, a knock-in mouse strain was generated that allows tamoxifen-induced expression of the homologous <i>Card14</i><sup>E138A</sup> mutation from the endogenous mouse <i>Card14</i> locus. Heterozygous expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> rapidly induced skin acanthosis, immune cell infiltration and expression of psoriasis-associated pro-inflammatory genes. Homozygous expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> induced more extensive skin inflammation and a severe systemic disease involving infiltration of myeloid cells in multiple organs, temperature reduction, weight loss and organ failure. This severe phenotype resembled acute exacerbations of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a rare form of psoriasis that can be caused by <i>CARD14</i> mutations in patients. CARD14<sup>E138A</sup>-induced skin inflammation and systemic disease were independent of adaptive immune cells, ameliorated by blocking TNF and induced by CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling only in keratinocytes. These results suggest that anti-inflammatory therapies specifically targeting keratinocytes, rather than systemic biologicals, might be effective for GPP treatment early in disease progression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56615">A Tgfbr1/Snai1-dependent developmental module at the core of vertebrate axial elongation</a></h4>

Formation of the vertebrate postcranial body axis follows two sequential but distinct phases. The first phase generates pre-sacral structures (the so-called primary body) through the activity of the primitive streak on axial progenitors within the epiblast. The embryo then switches to generate the secondary body (post-sacral structures), which depends on axial progenitors in the tail bud. Here we show that the mammalian tail bud is generated through an independent functional developmental module, concurrent but functionally different from that generating the primary body. This module is triggered by convergent Tgfbr1 and Snai1 activities that promote an incomplete epithelial to mesenchymal transition on a subset of epiblast axial progenitors. This EMT is functionally different from that coordinated by the primitive streak, as it does not lead to mesodermal differentiation but brings axial progenitors into a transitory state, keeping their progenitor activity to drive further axial body extension.

Animal models of Down syndrome (DS), trisomic for human chromosome 21 (HSA21) genes or orthologs, provide insights into better understanding and treatment options. The only existing transchromosomic (Tc) mouse DS model, Tc1, carries a HSA21 with over 50 protein coding genes (PCGs) disrupted. Tc1 is mosaic, compromising interpretation of results. Here, we 'clone' the 34 MB long arm of HSA21 (HSA21q) as a mouse artificial chromosome (MAC). Through multiple steps of microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, we created a new Tc DS mouse model, Tc(HSA21q;MAC)1Yakaz ('TcMAC21'). TcMAC21 is not mosaic and contains 93% of HSA21q PCGs that are expressed and regulatable. TcMAC21 recapitulates many DS phenotypes including anomalies in heart, craniofacial skeleton and brain, molecular/cellular pathologies, and impairments in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity. TcMAC21 is the most complete genetic mouse model of DS extant and has potential for supporting a wide range of basic and preclinical research.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55571">Aromatic interactions with membrane modulate human BK channel activation</a></h4>

Large-conductance potassium (BK) channels are transmembrane (TM) proteins that can be synergistically and independently activated by membrane voltage and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The only covalent connection between the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing domain and the TM pore and voltage sensing domains is a 15-residue 'C-linker'. To determine the linker’s role in human BK activation, we designed a series of linker sequence scrambling mutants to suppress potential complex interplay of specific interactions with the rest of the protein. The results revealed a surprising sensitivity of BK activation to the linker sequence. Combining atomistic simulations and further mutagenesis experiments, we demonstrated that nonspecific interactions of the linker with membrane alone could directly modulate BK activation. The C-linker thus plays more direct roles in mediating allosteric coupling between BK domains than previously assumed. Our results suggest that covalent linkers could directly modulate TM protein function and should be considered an integral component of the sensing apparatus.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54875">Inhibition stabilization is a widespread property of cortical networks</a></h4>

Many cortical network models use recurrent coupling strong enough to require inhibition for stabilization. Yet it has been experimentally unclear whether inhibition-stabilized network (ISN) models describe cortical function well across areas and states. Here, we test several ISN predictions, including the counterintuitive (paradoxical) suppression of inhibitory firing in response to optogenetic inhibitory stimulation. We find clear evidence for ISN operation in mouse visual, somatosensory, and motor cortex. Simple two-population ISN models describe the data well and let us quantify coupling strength. Although some models predict a non-ISN to ISN transition with increasingly strong sensory stimuli, we find ISN effects without sensory stimulation and even during light anesthesia. Additionally, average paradoxical effects result only with transgenic, not viral, opsin expression in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons; theory and expression data show this is consistent with ISN operation. Taken together, these results show strong coupling and inhibition stabilization are common features of the cortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54603">Coverage-dependent bias creates the appearance of binary splicing in single cells</a></h4>

Single cell RNA sequencing provides powerful insight into the factors that determine each cell's unique identity. Previous studies led to the surprising observation that alternative splicing among single cells is highly variable and follows a bimodal pattern: a given cell consistently produces either one or the other isoform for a particular splicing choice, with few cells producing both isoforms. Here we show that this pattern arises almost entirely from technical limitations. We analyze alternative splicing in human and mouse single cell RNA-seq datasets, and model them with a probabilistic simulator. Our simulations show that low gene expression and low capture efficiency distort the observed distribution of isoforms. This gives the appearance of binary splicing outcomes, even when the underlying reality is consistent with more than one isoform per cell. We show that accounting for the true amount of information recovered can produce biologically meaningful measurements of splicing in single cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49573">Golgi compartments enable controlled biomolecular assembly using promiscuous enzymes</a></h4>

The synthesis of eukaryotic glycans - branched sugar oligomers attached to cell-surface proteins and lipids - is organised like a factory assembly line. Specific enzymes within successive compartments of the Golgi apparatus determine where new monomer building blocks are linked to the growing oligomer. These enzymes act promiscuously and stochastically, causing microheterogeneity (molecule-to-molecule variability) in the final oligomer products. However, this variability is tightly controlled: a given eukaryotic protein type is typically associated with a narrow, specific glycan oligomer profile. Here we use ideas from the mathematical theory of self-assembly to enumerate the enzymatic causes of oligomer variability, and show how to eliminate each cause. We rigorously demonstrate that cells can specifically synthesize a larger repertoire of glycan oligomers by partitioning promiscuous enzymes across multiple Golgi compartments. This places limits on biomolecular assembly: glycan microheterogeneity becomes unavoidable when the number of compartments is limited, or enzymes are excessively promiscuous.

Neurons display different levels of vulnerability to Alzheimer’s pathology. Roussarie et al. experimentally profile and computationally model several relevant neuron types. Using a mouse-human framework, they identify genes linking Aß, aging, and tau in vulnerable neurons. Finally, they show experimentally that PTB, a regulator of tau splicing, contributes to vulnerability.

Inhibitory interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are central to excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, generation of gamma oscillations, and cognition. Dysfunction of PV interneurons disrupts information processing and cognitive behavior. Tyrosine receptor kinase B (trkB) signaling is known to regulate the differentiation and maturation of cortical PV interneurons during development, but is also suggested to be involved in the activity and network functions of PV interneurons in the adult brain. Using a novel viral strategy for cell-type and region-specific expression of a dominant negative trkB in adult mice, we show that reduced trkB signaling in PV interneurons in the PFC leads to pronounced morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes. Our results provide evidence for a critical role of trkB signaling in the function of PV interneurons in the adult brain, local network activities central to prefrontal circuit dynamics, and cognitive behavior.

Pathological protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases have the ability to transmit to unaffected cells, thereby templating their own aberrant conformation onto soluble proteins of the same kind. Proteopathic seeds can be released into the extracellular space, secreted in association with extracellular vesicles (EV) or exchanged by direct cell-to-cell contact. The extent to which each of these pathways contributes to the prion-like spreading of protein misfolding is unclear. Exchange of cellular cargo by both direct cell-to-cell contact as well as via EV depends on receptor-ligand interactions and subsequent release of cargo into the cytosol. We hypothesized that enabling these interactions through viral ligands enhances the aggregate-inducing capacity of EV-associated proteopathic seeds. Using different cellular models propagating model prion-like protein aggregates, mouse-adapted prions or pathogenic Tau aggregates, we demonstrate that vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 spike S increase protein aggregate induction by direct cell-to-cell contact or via viral glycoprotein-decorated EV. Thus, receptor-ligand interactions are major determinants of intercellular aggregate dissemination. Further, our data raise the intriguing possibility that acute or latent viral infections contribute to proteopathic seed spreading by facilitating intercellular cargo transfer.

Female reproductive development and maternal behavior are two intertwined phenotypes centrally controlled by the hypothalamus. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) can alter these processes especially when animals are exposed during development. We propose the concept that developmental exposure to a low environmentally relevant dose of EDC mixture induces a transgenerational alteration of female rat pubertal timing and ovarian physiology throughout epigenetic reprograming of hypothalamic Kiss1, Esr1 and Oxt1 loci. Such exposure also caused a multigenerational reduction of maternal behavior induced by the loss in hypothalamic dopaminergic signaling. Our results identify the hypothalamic Polycomb Group of epigenetic repressors as actors of this mechanism of transgenerational reproductive disruption. Using a cross-fostering approach, we identified that while the reduction in maternal phenotype was normalized in EDC exposed pups raised by unexposed dams, no reversal of the pubertal phenotype was achieved, suggesting a germline transmission of the reproductive phenotype.

Hallucinations constitute an intriguing model of how percepts are generated and how perception can fail. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that an altered perceptual weighting of the spectro-temporal modulations which characterize speech contributes to the emergence of auditory verbal hallucinations. Healthy adults (N=168) varying in their predisposition for hallucinations had to choose the more 'speech-like' of two presented ambiguous sound textures and give a confidence judgement. Using psychophysical reverse correlation, we quantified the contribution of different acoustic features to a listener's perceptual decisions. Higher hallucination proneness covaried with lower perceptual weighting of speech-typical, low-frequency acoustic energy. Remarkably, higher confidence judgements in single trials depended not only on acoustic evidence but also on an individual's hallucination proneness and schizotypy score. In line with an account of altered perceptual priors and differential weighting of sensory evidence, these results show that hallucination-prone individuals exhibit qualitative and quantitative changes in their perception of the modulations typical for speech.

Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are important for energizing goal directed behaviour towards food and are sensitive to changes in metabolic states. Fasting increases the incentive motivation for food, mobilization of energy stores and have sex-dependent effects. However, it is unknown how acute fasting alters excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission onto VTA dopamine neurons. An acute 16h overnight fast induced increased food seeking behaviour that was more predominant in male mice. Fasting increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and amplitude in male, but not female mice. This effect was not due to altered release probability as there was no change in the paired pulse ratio, nor was it due to an altered postsynaptic response as there was no change in the AMPAR/NMDA ratio or response to glutamate uncaging. However, this effect was consistent with an increase in the number of release sites. In addition, depolarization-induced-suppression of excitation (DSE), a measure of short-term endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity, was enhanced in female but not male fasted mice. There were no fasting-induced changes at inhibitory synapses onto dopamine neurons of male or female mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that fasting influences excitatory synapses differentially in male and female mice, but preserves inhibitory synapses onto dopamine neurons, indicating that the mesolimbic circuit of male and female mice respond differently to acute energy deprivation.

How white matter pathway integrity and neural co-activation patterns in the brain relate to complex cognitive functions remains a mystery in neuroscience. Here, we integrate neuroimaging, connectomics, and machine learning approaches to explore how multimodal brain connectivity relates to cognition. Specifically, we evaluate whether integrating functional and structural connectivity improves prediction of individual crystallised and fluid abilities in 415 unrelated healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project. Our primary results are two-fold. First, we demonstrate that integrating functional and structural information - at both a model input or output level - significantly outperforms functional or structural connectivity alone to predict individual verbal/language skills and fluid reasoning/executive function. Second, we show that distinct pairwise functional and structural connections are important for these predictions. In a secondary analysis, we find that structural connectivity derived from deterministic tractography is significantly superior than structural connectivity derived from probabilistic tractography to predict individual cognitive abilities.

Ibogaine is a psychedelic alkaloid that has attracted scientific interest because of its important antiaddictive properties evidenced in observational studies in humans, and in models for substance-use-disorders in rodents. Its subjective effect has been described as intense vivid dream-like experiences occurring while awake; hence, ibogaine is often referred to as an oneirogenic psychedelic. While this unique dream-like profile has been hypothesized to aid the antiaddictive effects in the past, the electrophysiological signatures of the ibogaine psychedelic state remain unknown. In our previous work, we showed in rats that ibogaine administration promotes a waking state with abnormal motor behavior, accompanied by a decrease in NREM and REM sleep. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the intracranial electroencephalogram during "ibogaine wakefulness". Ibogaine induced gamma oscillations with larger power than control levels but less coherent and less complex; i.e., this state shows clear REM sleep traits within the gamma frequency band. Thus, our results provide novel biological evidence for the association between the psychedelic state and REM sleep, and an empirical basis for the oneirogenic conjecture of ibogaine.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.25.172288v1?rss=1">THERMODYNAMIC MODEL OF MESOSCALE NEURAL FIELD DYNAMICS: DERIVATION AND LINEAR ANALYSIS</a></h4>

Motivated by previous research suggesting that mesoscopic collective activity has the defining characteristics of a turbulent system, we postulate a thermodynamic model based on the fundamental assumption that the activity of a neuron is characterized by two distinct stages: a sub-threshold stage, described by the value of mean membrane potential, and a transitional stage, corresponding to the firing event. We therefore distinguish between two types of energy: the potential energy released during a spike, and the internal kinetic energy that triggers a spike. Formalizing these assumptions produces a system of integro-differential equations that generalizes existing models [Wilson and Cowan, 1973, Amari, 1977], with the advantage of providing explicit equations for the evolution of state variables. The linear analysis of the system shows that it supports single- or triple- point equilibria, with the refractoriness property playing a crucial role in the generation of oscillatory behavior. In single-type (excitatory) systems this derives from the natural refractory state of a neuron, producing "refractory oscillations" with periods on the order of the neuron refractory period. In dual-type systems, the inhibitory component can provide this functionality even if neuron refractory period is ignored, supporting mesoscopic-scale oscillations at much lower activity levels. Assuming that the model has any relevance for the interpretation of LFP measurements, it provides insight into mesoscale dynamics. As an external forcing, theta may play a major role in modulating key parameters of the system: internal energy and excitability (refractoriness) levels, and thus in maintaining equilibrium states, and providing the increased activity necessary to sustain mesoscopic collective action. Linear analysis suggest that gamma oscillations are associated with the theta trough because it corresponds to higher levels of forced activity that decreases the stability of the equilibrium state, facilitating mesoscopic oscillations.

The supplementary eye fields (SEF) subserve high-level gaze functions and possess spatially tuned response fields, but the influence of visual landmarks on SEF response fields and their role in head-unrestrained transformations are unknown. We investigated these questions using a model-fitting approach employed recently to probe target (T) to gaze (G) and landmark-centered transformations through time in visuomotor response fields (Sajad et al., 2015; Bharmauria et al., 2020). Two head-unrestrained animals were trained to saccade toward a remembered visual target, in the presence of a visual landmark that shifted during the delay, causing gaze end points to partially shift in the same direction. 256 SEF neurons were recorded, including 68 with spatially tuned response fields. Model fits to response fields established that, like the frontal eye field (FEF) and superior colliculus (SC), spatially tuned SEF responses show a visuomotor transformation along an egocentric T-G continuum in eye-centered coordinates, with relatively poor fits to other models like T-fixed-to-landmark (T'). However, response field fits against a T-T' continuum revealed a partial shift toward T' in the SEF motor code, similar to the landmark influence on gaze. Unlike FEF, only motor neurons (with no visual response) showed a transient unintegrated T-T' shift (i.e., no correlation with T-G) during the delay, and only visuomotor neurons showed an integrated shift during the final motor burst (i.e., T-T' / T-G fits correlated). Based on these findings, we propose that frontal cortex incorporates landmark-centered information into a distributed, eye-centered target-to-gaze transformation through a reciprocal, complementary prefrontal circuit.

Primary visual cortex (V1) in the mouse projects to numerous brain areas, including several secondary visual areas, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. While it has been demonstrated that optogenetic silencing of V1 strongly impairs visually-guided behavior, it is not known which downstream areas are required for visual behaviors. Here we trained mice to perform a contrast-increment change detection task, for which substantial stimulus information is present in V1. Optogenetic silencing of visual responses in secondary visual areas revealed that their activity is required for even this simple visual task. In vivo electrophysiology showed that, although inhibiting secondary visual areas could produce some feedback effects in V1, the principal effect was profound suppression at the location of the optogenetic light. The results show that pathways through secondary visual areas are necessary for even simple visual behaviors.

Objective: The rapid acceleration of tools for recording neuronal populations and targeted optogenetic manipulation has enabled real-time, feedback control of neuronal circuits in the brain. Continuously-graded control of measured neuronal activity poses a wide range of technical challenges, which we address through a combination of optogenetic stimulation and a state-space optimal control framework implemented in the thalamocortical circuit of the awake mouse. Approach. Closed-loop optogenetic control of neurons was performed in real-time via stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressed in the somatosensory thalamus of the head-fixed mouse. A state-space linear dynamical system model structure was used to approximate the light-to-spiking input-output relationship in both single-neuron as well as multi-neuron scenarios when recording from multielectrode arrays. These models were utilized to design state feedback controller gains by way of linear quadratic optimal control and were also used online for estimation of state feedback, where a parameter-adaptive Kalman filter provided robustness to model-mismatch. Main results. This model-based control scheme proved effective for feedback control of single-neuron firing rate in the thalamus of awake animals. Notably, the graded optical actuation utilized here did not synchronize simultaneously recorded neurons, but heterogeneity across the neuronal population resulted in a varied response to stimulation. Simulated multi-output feedback control provided better control of a heterogeneous population and demonstrated how the approach generalizes beyond single-neuron applications. Significance. To our knowledge, this work represents the first experimental application of state space model-based feedback control for optogenetic stimulation. In combination with linear quadratic optimal control, the approaches laid out and tested here generalize to the multi-input/multi-output control problems necessitated by highly complex neural circuits. More generally, feedback control of neuronal circuits opens the door to adaptively interacting with the dynamics underlying sensory, motor, and cognitive signaling, enabling a deeper understanding of circuit function and ultimately the control of function in the face of injury or disease.

Automatic sleep stage scoring based on deep neural networks has come into focus of sleep researchers and physicians, as a reliable method able to objectively classify sleep stages, would save human resources and thus would simplify clinical routines. Due to novel open-source software libraries for Machine Learning in combination with enormous progress in hardware development in recent years a paradigm shift in the field of sleep research towards automatic diagnostics could be observed. We argue that modern Machine Learning techniques are not just a tool to perform automatic sleep stage classification but are also a creative approach to find hidden properties of sleep physiology. We have already developed and established algorithms to visualize and cluster EEG data, in a way so that we can already make first assessments on sleep health in terms of sleep-apnea and consequently daytime vigilance. In the following study, we further developed our method by the innovative approach to analyze cortical activity during sleep by computing vectorial cross-correlations of different EEG channels represented by hypnodensity graphs. We can show that this measure serves to estimate the period length of sleep cycles and thus can help to find disturbances due to pathological conditions.

As mammals evolved exposed to particular diets, naturally abundant compounds may have become part of the set of environmental co-determinants that shaped brain structure and function. Here we investigated whether bioactive factors found in apples directly affect hippocampal neural stem cells and promote neurogenesis in the adult mouse. Whereas the consumption of apple juice per se neither altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis nor improved learning and memory, we did find specific direct effects of apple-derived factors on neural stem cell survival and differentiation. Our results revealed that quercetin, the most abundant flavanol in apple peel, was anti-proliferative at high concentrations but acted pro-neurogenically at low concentrations. This was confirmed in vivo, with intraperitoneally-delivered quercetin promoting survival and neuronal differentiation, without affecting proliferation, likely via the PI3 kinase-Akt and Nrf2-Keap1 pathways, respectively. Using a bio-assay-guided fractionation approach with high-resolution collision induced dissociation mass spectroscopy, we also identified additional pro-neurogenic compounds in apple flesh that were not related to flavonoids. In particular, we found that 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a weak agonist to the lactate receptor, significantly increased both in vitro and in vivo neural precursor cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Altogether, this work shows that both flavonoids and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid are pro-neurogenic, not only by activating precursor cell proliferation but also through promoting cell cycle exit, cellular survival, and neuronal differentiation.

Dopamine neurons project to diverse regions throughout the brain to modulate various brain processes and behaviors. It is increasingly appreciated that dopamine neurons are heterogeneous in their gene expression, circuitry, physiology, and function. Current approaches to target dopamine neurons are largely based on single gene drivers, which either label all dopamine neurons, or mark a sub-set but concurrently label non-dopaminergic neurons. Here we establish a novel mouse line in which Flp recombinase is knocked-in to the endogenous Slc6a3 (dopamine active transporter, DAT) locus. DAT-Flp mice can be used with various Cre-expressing mouse lines to efficiently and selectively label dopaminergic subpopulations using Cre/Flp-dependent intersectional strategies. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by crossing DAT-Flp mice with NEX-Cre mice, to specifically label Neurod6-expressing dopamine neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens medial shell. DAT-Flp mice represent a novel tool, which will help parse the diverse functions mediated by dopaminergic circuits.

How do animals make behavioral decisions based on noisy sensory signals, which are moreover a tiny fraction of ongoing activity in the brain? Some theories suggest that sensory responses should be accumulated through time to reduce noise. Others suggest that feedback-based gain control of sensory responses allow small signals to be selectively amplified to drive behavior. We recorded from neuronal populations across posterior cortex as mice performed a decision-making task based on accumulating randomly timed pulses of visual evidence. Here we focus on a subset of neurons, with putative sensory responses that were time-locked to each pulse. These neurons exhibited a variety of amplitude (gain-like) modulations, notably by choice and accumulated evidence. These neural data inspired a hypothetical accumulation circuit with a multiplicative feedback-loop architecture, which parsimoniously explains deviations in perceptual discrimination from Weber-Fechner Law. Our neural observations thus led to a model that synthesizes both accumulation and feedback hypotheses.

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>Nectin‐2α, prominently expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), was localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb (clustered filled dots) in addition to the boundary between the adjacent somata of the clustered cholinergic neurons (edges of clustered open hexagons). This dendritic nectin‐2α formed puncta adherentia junctions cooperatively with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin and regulated synapse formation.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial habenula (MHb) receives afferents from the triangular septum and the medial septal complex, projects efferents to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the midbrain to regulate dopamine and serotonin levels, and is implicated in stress, depression, memory, and nicotine withdrawal syndrome. We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule nectin‐2α is localized at the boundary between adjacent somata of clustered cholinergic neurons and regulates the voltage‐gated A‐type K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv4.2 localization at membrane specializations in the MHb. This adhesion apparatus, named nectin‐2α spots, is not associated with the nectin‐binding protein afadin or any classic cadherins and their binding proteins p120‐catenin and β‐catenin. We showed here that nectin‐2α was additionally localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2 </i> reduced the number of synapses in the MHb without affecting their morphology. Nectin‐2α was associated with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin, forming puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs). Nectin‐2α was observed in the IPN, but not in the triangular septum or the medial septal complex. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2 </i> did not affect synapse formation in the IPN. These results indicate that nectin‐2α forms two types of adhesion apparatus in the MHb, namely nectin‐2α spots at neighboring somata and PAJs at neighboring dendrites, and that dendritic PAJs regulate synapse formation in the MHb.</p>

<p>We examined the chronology of infarct and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7, and d28 post β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Combination of ischemia and β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity has been shown to simultaneously increase neuro‐inflammation, endogenous Aβ deposition, and neurodegeneration. However, studies on the evolution of infarct and panorama of cellular degeneration as a synergistic or overlapping mechanism between ischemia and Aβ toxicity are lacking. Here, we compared fluorojade B (FJB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains primarily to examine the chronology of infarct, and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7, and d28 post Aβ toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats. We demonstrated a regional difference in cellular degeneration between cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus after cerebral injury. Glial cells in the cortex and corpus callosum underwent delayed FJB staining from d7 to d28, but neurons in cortex disappeared within the first week of cerebral injury. Striatal lesion core and globus pallidus of Aβ + ET1 rats showed extensive degeneration of neuronal cells compared with ET1 rats alone starting from d1. Differential and exacerbated expressions of cyclooxygenase‐2 might be the cause of excessive neuronal demise in the striatum of Aβ + ET1 rats. Such an investigation may improve our understanding to identify and manipulate a critical therapeutic window post comorbid injury.</p>

<p>We examined the visual response properties of genetically targeted neurons in retina, optic tectum, and torus longitudinalis of larval zebrafish. Functional characterization of dimming responsive neurons within these visual areas revealed responses with varied photosensitivity profiles, including (a) low‐sensitivity neurons that selectively respond to large light decrements, (b) high‐sensitivity neurons that selectively encode small decrements, and (c) broad sensitivity neurons that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Our data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vertebrate retinas contain circuits specialized to encode light level decrements. This information is transmitted to the brain by dimming‐sensitive OFF retinal ganglion cells (OFF‐RGCs) that respond to light decrements with increased firing. It is known that OFF‐RGCs with distinct photosensitivity profiles form parallel visual channels to the vertebrate brain, yet how these channels are processed by first‐ and higher order brain areas has not been well characterized in any species. To address this question in the larval zebrafish visual system, we examined the visual response properties of a genetically identified population of tectal neurons with a defined axonal projection to a second‐order visual area: <i>id2b </i>:<i>gal4‐ </i>positive torus longitudinalis projection neurons (TLPNs). TLPNs responded consistently to whole‐field dimming stimuli and exhibited the strongest responses when dimming was preceded by low light levels. Functional characterization of OFF‐RGC terminals in tectum revealed responses that varied in their photosensitivities: (a) low‐sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively respond to large light decrements, (b) high‐sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively encode small decrements, and (c) broad sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Diverse photosensitivity profiles were also observed using pan‐neuronal calcium imaging to identify dimming‐responsive neurons in both tectum and torus longitudinalis. Together, these data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing. Segregated OFF channels with different sensitivities may allow specific aspects of dimming‐evoked behaviors to be modulated by ambient light levels.</p>

<p>Long‐term in vitro culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes. The induction of four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c‐Myc) could decrease expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes during the long‐term culture.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult stem cells age during long‐term in vitro culture, and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can self‐renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, also display reduced differentiation potential after repeated passaging. However, the mechanistic details underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that long‐term in vitro culture of NSCs resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1β and IL6, the senescence‐associated enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), and the ER stress‐responsive transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). However, the cyclic and transient induction of four reprogramming factors (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, also known as octamer‐binding transcription factor 4; SRY [sex determining region Y]‐box 2; Kruppel‐like factor 4; and myelocytomatosis oncogene; collectively referred to as OSKM) can inhibit NSC aging, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes. We used ROSA‐4F NSCs, which express OSKM from only one allele, to minimize the potential for full reprogramming or tumor formation during NSC rejuvenation. We expect that this novel rejuvenation method will enhance the potential of NSCs as a clinical approach to the treatment of neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>Here, we show that the hemiellipsoid body of the true crab <i>Neohelice granulata </i> shares many of the insect mushroom body characters. In this brain center, which has previously been shown to reflect context‐dependent memory, we identified the presence of microglomeruli‐like complexes, input and output regions, aminergic innervation, adult neurogenesis, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. in vivo calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, stimuli of different nature can trigger divergent neuronal activity patterns in the output region. The study provides a series of data that is parsimonious with a shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothesis of a common origin for high‐order memory centers in bilateral animals presents the question of how different brain structures, such as the vertebrate hippocampus and the arthropod mushroom bodies, are both structurally and functionally comparable. Obtaining evidence to support the hypothesis that crustaceans possess structures equivalent to the mushroom bodies that play a role in associative memories has proved challenging. Structural evidence supports that the hemiellipsoid bodies of hermit crabs, crayfish and lobsters, spiny lobsters, and shrimps are homologous to insect mushroom bodies. Although a preliminary description and functional evidence supporting such homology in true crabs (Brachyura) has recently been shown, other authors consider the identification of a possible mushroom body homolog in Brachyura as problematic. Here we present morphological and immunohistochemical data in <i>Neohelice granulata </i> supporting that crabs possess well‐developed hemiellipsoid bodies that are resolved as mushroom bodies‐like structures. <i>Neohelice </i> exhibits a peduncle‐like tract, from which processes project into proximal and distal domains with different neuronal specializations. The proximal domains exhibit spines and <i>en passant </i>‐like processes and are proposed here as regions mainly receiving inputs. The distal domains exhibit a “trauben”‐like compartmentalized structure with bulky terminal specializations and are proposed here as output regions. In addition, we found microglomeruli‐like complexes, adult neurogenesis, aminergic innervation, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. Finally, in vivo calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, the output regions exhibit stimulus‐specific activity. Our results support the shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.</p>

The features of dopaminergic neurons (DAns) of nigrostriatal circuitry are orchestrated by a multitude of yet unknown factors, many of them genetic. Genetic variation between individuals at baseline can lead to differential susceptibility to and severity of diseases. As decline of DAns, a characteristic of Parkinson disease, heralds a significant decrease in dopamine level, measuring dopamine can reflect the integrity of DAns. To identify novel genetic regulators of the integrity of DAns, we used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains as model system to search for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum. The dopamine levels in dorsal striatum varied greatly in the eight CC founder strains, and the differences were inheritable in 32 derived CC strains. QTL mapping in these CC strains identified a QTL associated with dopamine level on chromosome X containing 393 genes. RNA-seq analysis of the ventral midbrain of two of the founder strains with large striatal dopamine difference (C57BL/6J and A/J) revealed 24 differentially expressed genes within the QTL. The protein-coding gene with the highest expression difference was Col4a6, which exhibited a 9-fold reduction in A/J compared to C57BL/6J, consistent with decreased dopamine levels in A/J. Publicly available single cell RNA-seq data from developing human midbrain suggests that Col4a6 is highly expressed in radial glia-like cells and neuronal progenitors, indicating possible involvement in neurogenesis. Interestingly, the lowered dopamine levels were accompanied by reduced striatal axonal branching of striatal DAns in A/J compared to C57BL/6J. Because Col4a6 is known to control axogenesis in non-mammal model organisms, we hypothesize that different dopamine levels in mouse dorsal striatum are due to differences in axogenesis induced by varying COL4A6 levels during neural development.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.28.176131v1?rss=1">The language of mental images: Characterizing hippocampal contributions to imageable word use during event construction</a></h4>

Accumulating evidence suggests that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the creative and flexible use of language. For example, amnesic patients with hippocampal damage produce less coherent and cohesive verbal discourse when constructing narratives about the past, present, and future. A recent study by Hilverman and colleagues (2017) found that amnesic patients with hippocampal damage also use less imageable words during narrative construction compared to healthy controls. These results suggest that in addition to supporting language use at the discourse level, the hippocampus also influences the quality of language at the single word level. However, the generalizability of these results to different types of language production tasks and the relationship to patients' broader impairments in episodic memory have yet to be examined. In the current study, we investigated whether amnesic patients with hippocampal damage produce less imageable words compared to healthy controls in two different types of language production tasks. In Experiment 1, participants constructed narratives about events depicted in visually presented pictures (picture narratives). In Experiment 2, participants constructed verbal narratives about remembered events from the past or simulated events in the future (past/future narratives). Across all types of narratives, patients produced words that were rated as having similar levels of imageability compared to controls. Importantly, this was the case both in patients' picture narratives, which did not require generating details from long-term memory and were matched to controls' with respect to narrative content, and in patients' narratives about past/future events, which required generating details from long-term memory and which were reduced in narrative content compared to those of controls. These results reveal that the hippocampus is not necessary for the use of imageable representations at the linguistic level, and that hippocampal contributions to imageable word use are independent of hippocampal contributions to episodic memory.

Excess consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) is likely to result in obesity and increases the predisposition to associated health disorders. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an important model to study the effects of HFD on metabolism, gut function, behavior, and ageing. In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of HFD on physiology and behavior of female flies. We found that HFD decreases lifespan, and also with age leads to accelerated decline of climbing ability and increased sleep fragmentation. Furthermore, long-term exposure to HFD results in elevated adipokinetic hormone (AKH) transcript levels and an increased crop with massive lipid stores. We detected no long-term effects of HFD on body mass, or levels of triacylglycerids, glycogen or glucose, although fecundity was diminished. Finally, we investigated the role of AKH and Drosophila insulin like peptides (DILPs) in regulating effects of HFD during aging. Both with normal diet (ND) and HFD, Akh mutant flies displayed increased longevity compared to control flies, both mutants and controls showed shortened lifespan on HFD compared to ND. Triple mutants of dilp2,3,5 are characterized by long lifespan on ND, but HFD drastically shortened longevity. Thus, long-term exposure to HFD impairs lifespan and fecundity and augments age-related behavioral senescence.

As the residual vision following a traumatic optic nerve injury can spontaneously recover over time, we explored the plasticity of cortical networks during the early post-optic nerve crush (ONC) phase. Using in vivo wide-field calcium imaging on awake Thy1-GCaMP6s mice, we characterized resting state and evoked cortical activity before, during, and 30 days after ONC. The recovery of monocular visual acuity and depth perception was evaluated at the same time points. Cortical responses to an LED flash decreased in the contralateral hemisphere in the primary visual cortex and in the secondary visual areas following the ONC, but was partially rescued between 3 and 5 days post-ONC, remaining stable thereafter. The connectivity between visual and non-visual regions was disorganized after the crush, as shown by a decorrelation, but correlated activity was restored 30 days after the injury. The number of surviving retinal ganglion cells dramatically dropped and remained low. At the behavioral level, the ONC resulted in visual acuity loss on the injured side and an increase in visual acuity with the non-injured eye. In conclusion, our results show a reorganization of connectivity between visual and associative cortical areas after an ONC, which is indicative of spontaneous cortical plasticity.

Background: The inability to observe relevant biological processes in vivo significantly restricts human neurodevelopmental research. Advances in appropriate in vitro model systems, including patient-specific human brain organoids and human Cortical Spheroids (hCSs) offer a pragmatic solution to this issue. In particular, hCSs are an accessible method of generating homogenous organoids of dorsal telencephalic fate, which recapitulate key aspects of human corticogenesis, including the formation of neural rosettes. These neurogeneic niches give rise to neural progenitors that subsequently differentiate into neurons. Atypical formation of these structures has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum conditions, from studies of patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells grown as 2D cultures. Thus far however, conventional methods of tissue preparation in this field limit the ability to image these structures in three-dimensions within intact hSC or other 3D preparations. To overcome this limitation, we have sought to optimise a methodological approach to process hCSs to maximise the utility of a novel Airy-beam light sheet microscope (ALSM) to acquire high resolution volumetric images of internal structures within hCS representative of early developmental time points. Results: Conventional approaches to imaging hCS by confocal microscopy were limited in their ability to image effectively into intact spheroids. Conversely, volumetric acquisition by ALSM offered superior imaging through intact, non-clarified, in vitro tissues, in both speed and resolution as compared to conventional confocal imaging systems. Furthermore, optimised immunohistochemistry and optical clearing of hCSs afforded improved imaging at depth. This permitted visualization of the morphology of the inner lumen of neural rosettes. Conclusion: We present an optimized methodology that takes advantage of an ALSM system that can rapidly image intact 3D brain organoids at high resolution while retaining a large field of view. This imaging modality can be applied to both non-cleared and cleared in vitro human brain spheroids derived from hiPSCs for precise examination of their internal 3D structures. Furthermore, this process represents a rapid, highly efficient method to examine and quantify in 3D the formation of key structures required for the coordination of neurodevelopmental processes in both health and disease states. We posit that this approach would facilitate investigation of human neurodevelopmental processes.

Sleep loss and aging impair hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in mammalian systems. Here we use the fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the relationship between sleep and spatial learning in healthy and impaired flies. The spatial learning assay is modeled after the Morris Water Maze. The assay uses a 'thermal maze' consisting of a 5X5 grid of Peltier plates maintained at {approx}37{degrees}C and a visual panorama. The first trial begins when a single tile that is associated with a specific visual cue is cooled to 25{degrees}C. For subsequent trials, the cold tile is heated, the visual panorama is rotated and the flies must find the new cold tile by remembering its association with the visual cue. Significant learning was observed with two different wild type strains: Cs and 2U, validating our design. Sleep deprivation prior to training impaired spatial learning. Learning was also impaired in the classic learning mutant rutabaga (rut); enhancing sleep restored learning to rut mutants. Further we found that flies exhibited dramatic age-dependent cognitive decline in spatial learning starting at 20 to 24 days of age. These impairments could be reversed by enhancing sleep. Finally, we find that spatial learning requires dopaminergic signaling and that enhancing dopaminergic signaling in aged flies restored learning. Our results are consistent with the impairments seen in rodents and humans. These results thus demonstrate a critical conserved role for sleep in supporting spatial learning, and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic intervention during aging.

Mice with transgenic expression of human SOD1G93A are a widely used model of ALS, with a caudal-rostral progression of motor impairment. Previous studies have quantified the progression of motoneurone (MN) degeneration based on size, even though alpha (-) and gamma ({gamma}-) MNs overlap in size. Therefore, using molecular markers and synaptic inputs, we quantified the survival of -MNs and {gamma}-MNs at the lumbar and cervical spinal segments of 3- and 4-month SOD1G93A mice, to investigate whether there is a caudal-rostral progression of MN death. By 3-months, in the cervical and lumbar spinal cord, there was -MN degeneration with complete {gamma}-MN sparing. At 3-months the cervical spinal cord had more -MNs per ventral horn than the lumbar spinal cord, in SOD1G93A mice. A similar spatial trend of degeneration was observed in the corticospinal tract, which remained intact in the cervical spinal cord at 3- and 4- months of age. These findings agree with the corticofugal synaptopathy model, that -MN and CST of the lumbar spinal cord are more susceptible to degeneration in SOD1G93A mice. Hence, there is spatial and temporal caudal-rostral progression of -MN and CST degeneration in SOD1G93A mice.

Chronic obesity is associated with several complications, including cognitive impairment and dementia. However, we have piecemeal knowledge of the mechanisms linking obesity to central nervous system damage. Adiposity leads to the metabolic syndrome, consisting of inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. In turn, these metabolic abnormalities cause cerebrovascular dysfunction, which may cause white and grey matter tissue loss and consequent cognitive impairment. While there have been several neuroimaging studies linking adiposity to changes in brain morphometry, a comprehensive investigation of the relationship has so far not been done. Here we use structural equation modelling applied to over 14,000 individuals from the UK Biobank to identify the causal chain that links adiposity to cognitive dysfunction. We found that body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were positively related to higher plasma C-reactive protein, dyslipidemia, occurrence of hypertension and diabetes, all of which were in turn related to cerebrovascular disease as measured by volume of white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. White mater hyperintensities were associated with lower cortical thickness and volume and higher subcortical volumes, which were associated with cognitive deficits on tests of visuospatial memory, fluid intelligence, and working memory among others. In follow-up analyses we found that inflammation, hypertension and diabetes mediated 20% of the relationship between obesity and cerebrovascular disease and that cerebrovascular disease mediated a significant proportion of the relationship between obesity and cortical thickness and volume. We also showed that volume of white matter hyperintensities was related to decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in the majority of white matter tracts, pointing to white matter dysconnectivity as a major cause of impaired cognition. Our results have clinical implications, supporting a role for the management of adiposity in the prevention of late-life dementia and cognitive decline.

Seasonal daylength has been linked to the development and prevalence of mood disorders, however, the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unknown. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that developmental exposure to seasonal photoperiods has enduring effects on the activity of mouse dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons, their intrinsic electrical properties, as well as on depression and anxiety-related behaviors. Here we focus on the possible ionic mechanisms that underlie the observed photoperiodic programming of the electrophysiological properties of serotonin neurons, focusing on the twin-pore K+ channels TREK-1 and TASK-1 that set resting membrane potential and regulate excitability. Using multielectrode array recordings in ex vivo dorsal raphe slices, we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of these channels on the spike rates of serotonin neurons of mice from different photoperiods. Pharmacological inhibition of TREK-1 significantly increased spike frequency in Short and Equinox photoperiod cohorts, but did not further elevate the firing rate in slices from Long photoperiod mice, suggesting that TREK-1 function is reduced in Long photoperiods. In contrast, inhibition of TASK-1 resulted in increases in firing rates across all photoperiods, suggesting that it contributes to setting excitability, but is not regulated by photoperiod. To examine if photoperiod impacts transcriptional regulation of TREK-1, we quantified Kcnk2 mRNA levels specifically in dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons using triple-label RNAscope. We found that Long photoperiod significantly reduced levels of Kcnk2 in serotonin neurons co-expressing Tph2, and Pet-1, Photoperiodic effects on the function and expression of TREK-1 were blocked in melatonin 1 receptor knockout (MT-1KO) mice, consistent with previous findings that MT-1 signaling is necessary for photoperiodic programming of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons. Taken together these results indicate that photoperiodic regulation of TREK-1 expression and function plays a key role in photoperiodic programming the excitability of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 transcripts were previously shown to be enriched in rod bipolar cells (BCs), secondary neurons of the retina that form synapses with rod photoreceptors. Using two different antibodies, LRRTM4 was found to reside primarily at rod BC dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced.

<p>Dark‐adapting the fiddler crab eye at night triggers great changes in rhabdom diameters and crystalline cone shape, increasing optical sensitivity and acceptance angles. However, during daytime the eye remains effectively light‐adapted in the dark. Surprisingly, screening pigments do not appear to migrate to help moderate fluctuations in brightness.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A great diversity of adaptations is found among animals with compound eyes and even closely related taxa can show large variation in their light‐adaptation strategies. A prime example of a visual system evolved to function in specific light environments is the fiddler crab, used widely as a model to research aspects of crustacean vision and neural pathways. However, questions remain regarding how their eyes respond to the changes in brightness spanning many orders of magnitude, associated with their habitat and ecology. The fiddler crab <i>Afruca tangeri </i> forages at low tide on tropical and semi‐tropical mudflats, under bright sunlight and on moonless nights, suggesting that their eyes undergo effective light adaptation. Using synchrotron X‐ray tomography, light and transmission electron microscopy and <i>in vivo </i> ophthalmoscopy<i>, </i> we describe the ultrastructural changes in the eye between day and night. Dark adaptation at dusk triggered extensive widening of the rhabdoms and crystalline cone tips. This doubled the ommatidial acceptance angles and increased microvillar surface area for light capture in the rhabdom, theoretically boosting optical sensitivity 7.4 times. During daytime, only partial dark‐adaptation was achieved and rhabdoms remained narrow, indicating strong circadian control on the process. Bright light did not evoke changes in screening pigment distributions, suggesting a structural inability to adapt rapidly to the light level fluctuations frequently experienced when entering their burrow to escape predators. This should enable fiddler crabs to shelter for several minutes without undergoing significant dark‐adaptation, their vision remaining effectively adapted for predator detection when surfacing again in bright light.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Afferent activity dynamically regulates neuronal properties and connectivity in the central nervous system. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA‐binding protein that regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Whether and how FMRP level and localization are regulated by afferent input remains sparsely examined and how such regulation is associated with neuronal response to changes in sensory input is unknown. We characterized changes in FMRP level and localization in the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a primary cochlear nucleus, following afferent deprivation by unilateral cochlea removal. We observed rapid (within 2 hr) aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of deafferented NM neurons. Neurons that exhibited persistent FMRP aggregation at 12–24 hr eventually lost cytoplasmic Nissl substance, indicating cell death. A week later, FMRP expression in surviving neurons regained its homeostasis, with a slightly reduced immunostaining intensity and enhanced heterogeneity. Correlation analyses under the homeostatic status (7–14 days) revealed that neurons expressing relatively more FMRP had a higher capability of maintaining cell body size and ribosomal activity, as well as a better ability to detach inactive presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the intensity of an inhibitory postsynaptic protein, gephyrin, was reduced following deafferentation and was positively correlated with FMRP intensity, implicating an involvement of FMRP in synaptic dynamics in response to reduced afferent inputs. Collectively, this study demonstrates that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements.</p>

<p>Comparative studies on canid cognition have revealed tantalizing evidence for some restructuring in the canine brain.

We demonstrate that this parameter is largely consistent across canid species although regional differences in gyrification exist.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the last 15 years, research on canid cognition has revealed that domestic dogs possess a surprising array of complex socio‐cognitive skills pointing to the possibility that the domestication process might have uniquely altered their brains; however, we know very little about how evolutionary processes (natural or artificial) might have modified underlying neural structure to support species‐specific behaviors. Evaluating the degree of cortical folding (i.e., gyrification) within canids may prove useful, as this parameter is linked to functional variation of the cerebral cortex. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of domestication on the canine cortical surface, we compared the gyrification index (GI) in 19 carnivore species, including six wild canid and 13 domestic dog individuals. We also explored correlations between global and local GI with brain mass, cortical thickness, white and grey matter volume and surface area. Our results indicated that GI values for domestic dogs are largely consistent with what would be expected for a canid of their given brain mass, although more variable than that observed in wild canids. We also found that GI in canids is positively correlated with cortical surface area, cortical thickness and total cortical grey matter volumes. While we found no evidence of global differences in GI between domestic and wild canids, certain regional differences in gyrification were observed.</p>

We previously reported in young chicks bidirectional gene expression regulation of the <i>BMP2 </i>, <i>4 </i>, and <i>7 </i> in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) after visual manipulation, tied to the direction of induced eye growth changes. Here we report local (regional) differences in expression patterns that were also treatment specific. Both <i>BMP2 </i> and <i>BMP4 </i> genes showed the expected increased expression with imposed myopic defocus (+10 D lens) after 2 and 48 hr, albeit limited to central and mid‐peripheral RPE zones. In contrast, the expected decrease in <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression with imposed hyperopic defocus (−10 D lens) was evident across all three zones after both 2 and 48 hr, with similar patterns observed after 48 hr with FD. Similar but smaller changes were recorded for <i>BMP4 </i> and <i>BMP7 </i> gene expression with the latter myopia‐inducing treatments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported bidirectional gene expression regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (<i>BMP2 </i>, <i>4 </i>, and <i>7 </i>) in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to imposed optical defocus and form‐deprivation (FD). This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 hr, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. <i>BMP2 </i>, <i>4 </i>, and <i>7 </i> gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both <i>BMP2 </i> and <i>BMP4 </i> genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 hr. In contrast, with the −10 D lens <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 hr. Similar patterns of <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 hr of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for <i>BMP4 </i> and <i>BMP7 </i> gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in <i>BMP </i> gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increased oxidative stress has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, but also with neurological diseases sharing pathophysiological pathways like epilepsy. Lipofuscin is a non‐degradable end‐product of oxidative stress; its cerebral presence reflects the cumulative amount of oxidative stress the brain has endured. In this study, we have observed prominent autofluorescent particles in the pial arterial wall and in neocortical parenchyma of young, drug‐resistant epilepsy patients (18‐28 years old) who underwent resective brain surgery (n=6), as well as in older control patients (n=3). With fluorescence spectroscopic imaging, brightfield microscopy, histochemistry and fluorescence lifetime imaging, these autofluorescent particles were identified as the <i>age pigment </i> lipofuscin. An evaluation of these lipofuscin particles using Imaris© software allowed robust quantification, while the 3D properties allowed visualization of the complex configuration. We elaborate on the usefulness of lipofuscin as a marker of cumulative oxidative stress in the brain. Furthermore, we speculate on the observed differences in particle size and density that we found between young patients and older controls, which could imply a role for lipofuscin in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and possibly other neurological diseases.</p>

Alternative splicing plays important role in brain development, however its global contribution to human neurodevelopmental diseases (NDD) has not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the relationships between splicing isoforms expression in the brain and de novo loss-of-function mutations identified in the patients with NDDs. We constructed isoform transcriptome of the developing human brain, and observed differentially expressed isoforms and isoform co-expression modules undetectable by the gene-level analyses. These isoforms were enriched in loss-of-function mutations and microexons, co-expressed with a unique set of partners, and had higher prenatal expression. We experimentally tested the impact of splice site mutations in five NDD risk genes, including SCN2A, DYRK1A and BTRC, and demonstrated exon skipping. Furthermore, our results suggest that the splice site mutation in BTRC reduces translational efficiency, likely impacting Wnt signaling through impaired degradation of {beta}-catenin. We propose that functional effect of mutations associated with human diseases should be investigated at isoform- rather than gene-level resolution.

The exploration of the relationship between gene expression profiles and neural response patterns known to be altered in major depressive disorder provides a unique opportunity to identify novel targets for diagnosis and therapy. Here, we estimated the spatial association between genome-wide transcriptome maps and brain activation patterns from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with two established paradigms of great relevance for mood disorders. While task-specific neural responses during emotion processing were primarily associated with expression patterns of genes involved in cellular transport, reward processing was related to neuronal development, synapse regulation, as well as gene transcription. Multimodal integration of single-site and meta-analytic imaging data with risk genes associated with depression revealed a regional susceptibility of functional activity, modulated by master regulators TCF4 and MEF2C. The identification of multiple subordinate genes correlated with fMRI maps and their corresponding regulators presumably will reshape the prospects for neuroimaging genetics.

There is an unresolved discrepancy between popular hierarchical and multiple-demand perspectives on the functional organisation of the human frontal lobes. Here, we tested alternative predictions of these perspectives with a novel fMRI switching paradigm. Each trial involved switching attention between stimuli, but at different levels of difficulty and abstraction. As expected, increasing response times were evident when comparing low-level perceptual switching to more abstract dimension, rule and task-switching. However, there was no evidence of an abstraction hierarchy within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Nor was there recruitment of additional anterior PFC regions under increased switching demand. Instead, switching activated a widespread network of frontoparietal and cerebellar regions. Critically, the activity within PFC sub-regions uniformly increased with behavioural switch costs. We propose that both perspectives have some validity, but neither is complete. Too many studies have reported dissociations within MD for this volume to be functionally uniform, and the recruitment of more anterior regions with increased general difficulty cannot explain those results. Conversely, whilst reproducible evidence for a hierarchical functional organisation has been reported, this cannot be explained in terms of abstraction of representation or reconfiguration per se, because those interpretations generalise poorly to other task contexts.

Mutations in Fmr1 are the leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. We previously found that Fmr1 acts as a ~2-fold activator of translation of large proteins in Drosophila oocytes, in contrast to its proposed role as a repressor of translation elongation. Here, we show that genes associated with autism spectrum disorders tend to be dosage-sensitive and encode proteins that are larger than average. Reanalysis of Fmr1 KO mouse cortex ribosome profiling data demonstrates that autism-associated mRNAs encoding large proteins exhibit a concordant reduction in ribosome footprints, consistent with a general role for Fmr1 as a translational activator. We find no evidence that differential ribosomal pausing affects translational output in Fmr1-deficient Drosophila oocytes or mouse cortex. Furthermore, long Fmr1 target transcripts are preferentially enriched in stress granules upon acute stress. Our data thus identify a critical role for Fmr1 in promoting the translation of long, stress-sensitive, autism-associated mRNAs.

The ability to share ideas through language is our species' signature cognitive skill, but how this feat is achieved by the brain remains unknown. Inspired by the success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in explaining neural responses in perceptual tasks (Kell et al., 2018; Khaligh-Razavi &amp; Kriegeskorte, 2014; Schrimpf et al., 2018; Yamins et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2017), we here investigated whether state-of-the-art ANN language models (e.g. Devlin et al., 2018; Pennington et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2019) capture human brain activity elicited during language comprehension. We tested 43 language models spanning major current model classes on three neural datasets (including neuroimaging and intracranial recordings) and found that the most powerful generative transformer models (Radford et al., 2019) accurately predict neural responses, in some cases achieving near-perfect predictivity relative to the noise ceiling. In contrast, simpler word-based embedding models (e.g. Pennington et al., 2014) only poorly predict neural responses (&lt;10% predictivity). Models' predictivities are consistent across neural datasets, and also correlate with their success on a next-word-prediction task (but not other language tasks) and ability to explain human comprehension difficulty in an independent behavioral dataset. Intriguingly, model architecture alone drives a large portion of brain predictivity, with each model's untrained score predictive of its trained score. These results support the hypothesis that a drive to predict future inputs may shape human language processing, and perhaps the way knowledge of language is learned and organized in the brain. In addition, the finding of strong correspondences between ANNs and human representations opens the door to using the growing suite of tools for neural network interpretation to test hypotheses about the human mind.

Somatodendritic missorting of the axonal protein TAU is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. Cultured rodent primary neurons and iPSC-derived neurons are often used for studying mechanisms of neuronal polarity, including TAU trafficking. However, these models are expensive, time-consuming and/or re-quire the sacrification of animals. In this study, we show that neurons derived from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, generated with a RA/BDNF-based differentiation procedure, are suitable for investigating axonal TAU sorting. These SH-SY5Y-derived neurons show pronounced neuronal polarity, axodendritic outgrowth, ex-pression of the neuronal maturation markers TAU and MAP2, and, importantly, effi-cient axonal sorting of endogenous and transfected human wild type TAU. By using SH-SY5Y-derived neurons and mouse primary neurons, we demonstrate that axon-al TAU enrichment requires the presence of the TAU C-terminal half, as a truncated C-terminus-lacking construct (N-term-TAUHA) is localized in the soma, where it ac-cumulates. Moreover, SH-SY5Y-derived neurons do not show classical axon initial segment (AIS) formation, indicated by the lack of Ankyrin G (ANKG) enrichment at the proximal axon, which suggests that successful axonal TAU sorting is independ-ent of complete AIS formation. Taken together, our results suggest i) that SH-SY5Y-derived neurons are a valuable human neuronal model for studying TAU sorting, which is readily accessible at low cost and without animal need, and that ii) the mechanisms of axonal TAU targeting require the TAU C-terminal half but no ANKG enrichment at the proximal axon.

<p>by Aleksey V. Zimin, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

The introduction of third-generation DNA sequencing technologies in recent years has allowed scientists to generate dramatically longer sequence reads, which when used in whole-genome sequencing projects have yielded better repeat resolution and far more contiguous genome assemblies. While the promise of better contiguity has held true, the relatively high error rate of long reads, averaging 8–15%, has made it challenging to generate a highly accurate final sequence. Current long-read sequencing technologies display a tendency toward systematic errors, in particular in homopolymer regions, which present additional challenges. A cost-effective strategy to generate highly contiguous assemblies with a very low overall error rate is to combine long reads with low-cost short-read data, which currently have an error rate below 0.5%. This hybrid strategy can be pursued either by incorporating the short-read data into the early phase of assembly, during the read correction step, or by using short reads to “polish” the consensus built from long reads. In this report, we present the assembly polishing tool POLCA (POLishing by Calling Alternatives) and compare its performance with two other popular polishing programs, Pilon and Racon. We show that on simulated data POLCA is more accurate than Pilon, and comparable in accuracy to Racon. On real data, all three programs show similar performance, but POLCA is consistently much faster than either of the other polishing programs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0aTjcPtJdwU" width="1" />

<p>by Fabian Konrath, Anna Mittermeier, Elena Cristiano, Jana Wolf, Alexander Loewer</p>

The transcription factors NF-κB and p53 are key regulators in the genotoxic stress response and are critical for tumor development. Although there is ample evidence for interactions between both networks, a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk is lacking. Here, we developed a systematic approach to identify potential interactions between the pathways. We perturbed NF-κB signaling by inhibiting IKK2, a critical regulator of NF-κB activity, and monitored the altered response of p53 to genotoxic stress using single cell time lapse microscopy. Fitting subpopulation-specific computational p53 models to this time-resolved single cell data allowed to reproduce in a quantitative manner signaling dynamics and cellular heterogeneity for the unperturbed and perturbed conditions. The approach enabled us to untangle the integrated effects of IKK/ NF-κB perturbation on p53 dynamics and thereby derive potential interactions between both networks. Intriguingly, we find that a simultaneous perturbation of multiple processes is necessary to explain the observed changes in the p53 response. Specifically, we show interference with the activation and degradation of p53 as well as the degradation of Mdm2. Our results highlight the importance of the crosstalk and its potential implications in p53-dependent cellular functions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M9AmjZVWCJo" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent studies carried on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients suggest that the disease may initiate in the motor cortex and spread to its targets along the corticofugal tracts. In this study, we aimed at experimentally testing the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><i>Sod1 </i>
<sup>
   <i>G86R </i>
</sup> and <i>Fezf2 </i> knockout mouse lines were crossed to generate a model that ubiquitously expresses a mutant of the murine <i>Sod1 </i> gene, a condition sufficient to induce progressive motor symptoms and premature death, but genetically lacks corticospinal neurons and other subcerebral projection neurons, one of the main populations of corticofugal neurons. Disease onset and survival were recorded, and weight and motor behaviour were longitudinally followed. Hyperreflexia and spasticity were monitored using electromyographic recordings. Neurodegeneration and gliosis were further assessed by histological techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Absence of subcerebral projection neurons delayed disease onset, reduced weight loss and motor impairment, and increased survival without modifying disease duration. Absence of corticospinal neurons also limited pre‐symptomatic hyperreflexia, a typical component of the upper motor neuron syndrome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Major corticofugal tracts are critical to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis onset and progression. In the context of the disease, subcerebral projection neurons may carry detrimental signals to their downstream targets. In its whole, this study provides the first experimental arguments in favour of the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impairment of glycinergic neurotransmission leads to complex movement and behavioral disorders. Patients harboring glycine receptor autoantibodies suffer from stiff‐person syndrome or its severe variant progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Enhanced receptor internalization was proposed as the common molecular mechanism upon autoantibody binding. Although functional impairment of glycine receptors following autoantibody binding has recently been investigated, it is still incompletely understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A cell‐based assay was used for positive sample evaluation. Glycine receptor function was assessed by electrophysiological recordings and radioligand binding assays. The <i>in vivo </i> passive transfer of patient autoantibodies was done using the zebrafish animal model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Glycine receptor function as assessed by glycine dose‐response curves showed significantly decreased glycine potency in the presence of patient sera. Upon binding of autoantibodies from two patients a decreased fraction of desensitized receptors was observed while closing of the ion channel remained fast. The glycine receptor N‐terminal residues <sup>29</sup>A to <sup>62</sup>G were mapped as a common epitope of glycine receptor autoantibodies. An <i>in vivo </i> transfer into the zebrafish animal model generated a phenotype with disturbed escape behavior accompanied by a reduced number of glycine receptor clusters in the spinal cord of affected animals.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies against the extracellular domain mediate alterations of glycine receptor physiology. Moreover, our <i>in vivo </i> data demonstrate that the autoantibodies are a direct cause of the disease, since the transfer of human glycine receptor autoantibodies to zebrafish larvae generated impaired escape behavior in the animal model compatible with abnormal startle response in SPS or PERM patients.</p>

<p>Electrical microstimulation can treat neurological disorders; however, the mechanisms defining therapeutic efficacy are poorly characterized. In the mouse cortex, increasing the stimulation waveform asymmetry differentially modulates the spatial distribution and level of sustained neuronal activation, depending on leading polarity, under mesoscale (top) and two‐photon (bottom) imaging.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Electrical stimulation has been critical in the development of an understanding of brain function and disease. Despite its widespread use and obvious clinical potential, the mechanisms governing stimulation in the cortex remain largely unexplored in the context of pulse parameters. Modeling studies have suggested that modulation of stimulation pulse waveform may be able to control the probability of neuronal activation to selectively stimulate either cell bodies or passing fibers depending on the leading polarity. Thus, asymmetric waveforms with equal charge per phase (i.e., increasing the leading phase duration and proportionately decreasing the amplitude) may be able to activate a more spatially localized or distributed population of neurons if the leading phase is cathodic or anodic, respectively. Here, we use two‐photon and mesoscale calcium imaging of GCaMP6s expressed in excitatory pyramidal neurons of male mice to investigate the role of pulse polarity and waveform asymmetry on the spatiotemporal properties of direct neuronal activation with 10‐Hz electrical stimulation. We demonstrate that increasing cathodic asymmetry effectively reduces neuronal activation and results in a more spatially localized subpopulation of activated neurons without sacrificing the density of activated neurons around the electrode. Conversely, increasing anodic asymmetry increases the spatial spread of activation and highly resembles spatiotemporal calcium activity induced by conventional symmetric cathodic stimulation. These results suggest that stimulation polarity and asymmetry can be used to modulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity thus increasing the effective parameter space of electrical stimulation to restore sensation and study circuit dynamics.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to the upper limb, lower limb distal nerve transfer (DNT) outcomes are poor, likely due to the longer length of regeneration required. DNT surgery to treat foot drop entails rerouting a tibial nerve branch to the denervated common fibular nerve stump to reinnervate the tibialis anterior muscle for ankle dorsiflexion. Conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) prior to nerve repair surgery accelerates nerve regeneration and promotes sensorimotor recovery. We hypothesize that CES prior to DNT will promote nerve regeneration to restore ankle dorsiflexion.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One week following common fibular nerve crush, CES was delivered to the tibial nerve in half the animals, and at 2 weeks, all animals received a DNT. To investigate the effects of CES on nerve regeneration, a series of kinetic, kinematic, skilled locomotion, electrophysiologic, and immunohistochemical outcomes were assessed. The effects of CES on the nerve were investigated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CES‐treated animals had significantly accelerated nerve regeneration (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), increased walking speed, and improved skilled locomotion. The injured limb had greater vertical peak forces, with improved duty factor, near‐complete recovery of braking, propulsive forces, and dorsiflexion (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.01). Reinnervation of the tibialis anterior muscle was confirmed with nerve conduction studies and immunohistochemical analysis of the neuromuscular junction. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CES does not induce Wallerian degeneration, nor does it cause macrophage infiltration of the distal tibial nerve.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tibial nerve CES prior to DNT significantly improved functional recovery of the common fibular nerve and its muscle targets without inducing injury to the donor nerve. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Myopic eyes grow too long so images are focused short of the retina. What controls this excessive growth? We know that across species, deprivation of detailed vision (form deprivation, FD) increases the rate of eye elongation and induces myopia. When the FD ceases, these myopic eyes then slow their growth and recover from their myopia. We show here that in young mammalian eyes, this bidirectional response still occurs after the optic nerve is cut, implicating local retinal control of eye growth. However, the FD eye grows excessively after optic nerve section showing that the fine‐tuning of eye growth requires an intact optic nerve.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM + FD, <i>n </i> = 7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS + FD, <i>n </i> = 7); or ONS without FD (ONS, <i>n </i> = 9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS + FD developed −8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM + FD animals (−5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior vitreous chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS + FD eyes still retained −3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artifact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.</p>

<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and is generated by either the type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases (PI4P5Ks) or the type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases (PI5P4Ks). In this study, we describe the neuro‐anatomical localization of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ in the normal brain. PI5P4Kα is expressed in both oligodendrocytes and some neurons, while PI5P4Kβ is expressed solely in neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and generation of the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate. PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub> can be generated by two families of kinases: type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases, encoded by PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B and PIP5K1C, and type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases, encoded by PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C. While the roles of the type 1 enzymes in brain function have been extensively studied, the roles of the type 2 enzymes are poorly understood. Using selective antibodies validated by genetic deletion of pip4k2a or pip4k2b in mouse brain, we characterized the location of the enzymes, PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ, encoded by these genes. In mice, we demonstrate that PI5P4Kα is expressed in adulthood, whereas PI5P4Kβ is expressed early in development. PI5P4Kα localizes to white matter tracts, especially the corpus callosum, and at a low level in neurons, while PI5P4Kβ is expressed in neuronal populations, especially hippocampus and cortex. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that PI5P4Kα co‐localizes with the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, whereas PI5P4Kβ co‐localizes with the neuronal marker, NeuN. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that both kinases are contained in axon terminals and dendritic spines adjacent to the synaptic membrane, which support a potential role in synaptic transmission. Immunoperoxidase analysis of macaque and human brain tissue demonstrate a conserved pattern for PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ. These results highlight the diverse cell‐autonomous expression of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ and support further exploration into their role in synaptic function in the brain.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organized by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organization and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organization, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibers, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organization and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 1 A (CMT1A) is caused by an intrachromosomal duplication of the gene encoding for <i>PMP22 </i> leading to peripheral nerve dysmyelination, axonal loss, and progressive muscle weakness. No therapy is available. PXT3003 is a low‐dose combination of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol which has been shown to improve disease symptoms in <i>Pmp22 </i> transgenic rats, a bona fide model of CMT1A disease. However, the superiority of PXT3003 over its single components or dual combinations have not been tested. Here, we show that in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co‐culture system derived from transgenic rats, PXT3003 induced myelination when compared to its single and dual components. Applying a clinically relevant (“translational”) study design in adult male CMT1A rats for 3 months, PXT3003, but not its dual components, resulted in improved performance in behavioral motor and sensory endpoints when compared to placebo. Unexpectedly, we observed only a marginally increased number of myelinated axons in nerves from PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats. However, in electrophysiology, motor latencies correlated with increased grip strength indicating a possible effect of PXT3003 on neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and muscle fiber pathology. Indeed, PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats displayed an increased perimeter of individual NMJs and a larger number of functional NMJs. Moreover, muscles of PXT3003 CMT1A rats displayed less neurogenic atrophy and a shift toward fast contracting muscle fibers. We suggest that ameliorated motor function in PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats result from restored NMJ function and muscle innervation, independent from myelination.</p>

<p>Modern neural networks are often regarded as complex black-box functions
whose behavior is difficult to understand owing to their nonlinear dependence
on the data and the nonconvexity in their loss landscapes. In this work, we
show that these common perceptions can be completely false in the early phase
of learning. In particular, we formally prove that, for a class of well-behaved
input distributions, the early-time learning dynamics of a two-layer
fully-connected neural network can be mimicked by training a simple linear
model on the inputs. We additionally argue that this surprising simplicity can
persist in networks with more layers and with convolutional architecture, which
we verify empirically. Key to our analysis is to bound the spectral norm of the
difference between the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at initialization and an
affine transform of the data kernel; however, unlike many previous results
utilizing the NTK, we do not require the network to have disproportionately
large width, and the network is allowed to escape the kernel regime later in
training.

<p>Primates display a marked ability to learn habits in uncertain and dynamic
environments. The associated perceptions and actions of such habits engage
distributed neural circuits. Yet, precisely how such circuits support the
computations necessary for habit learning remain far from understood. Here we
construct a formal theory of network energetics to account for how changes in
brain state produce changes in sequential behavior. We exercise the theory in
the context of multi-unit recordings spanning the caudate nucleus, prefrontal
cortex, and frontal eyefields of female macaque monkeys engaged in 60-180
sessions of a free scan task that induces motor habits. The theory relies on
the determination of effective connectivity between recording channels, and on
the stipulation that a brain state is taken to be the trial-specific firing
rate across those channels. The theory then predicts how much energy will be
required to transition from one state into another, given the constraint that
activity can spread solely through effective connections. Consistent with the
theory's predictions, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions
between more similar and more complex trial saccade patterns, and for sessions
characterized by less entropic selection of saccade patterns. Using a virtual
lesioning approach, we demonstrate the resilience of the observed relationships
between minimum control energy and behavior to significant disruptions in the
inferred effective connectivity. Our theoretically principled approach to the
study of habit learning paves the way for future efforts examining how behavior
arises from changing patterns of activity in distributed neural circuitry.

<p>Compositionality is a basic structural feature of both biological and
artificial neural networks. Learning compositional functions via gradient
descent incurs well known problems like vanishing and exploding gradients,
making careful learning rate tuning essential for real-world applications. This
paper proves that multiplicative weight updates satisfy a descent lemma
tailored to compositional functions. Based on this lemma, we derive Madam---a
multiplicative version of the Adam optimiser---and show that it can train state
of the art neural network architectures without learning rate tuning. We
further show that Madam is easily adapted to train natively compressed neural
networks by representing their weights in a logarithmic number system. We
conclude by drawing connections between multiplicative weight updates and
recent findings about synapses in biology.

<p>We show that a randomly initialized neural network of *any architecture* has
its Tangent Kernel converge to a deterministic limit, as the network widths
tend to infinity. We demonstrate how to calculate this limit. To do so, we
identify a commonly satisfied condition that rigorously justifies the usage of
the *gradient independence assumption (GIA)* (i.e. when a random matrix is
assumed independent from its transpose) in this calculation. Conversely, we
give an example where this condition fails and GIA leads to incorrect answers.

<p>In the auditory streaming paradigm alternating identical sequences of pure
tones can be perceived as a single galloping rhythm (integration) or as two
sequences with separated low and high tones (segregation). Although studied for
decades, the neural mechanisms underlining this perceptual grouping of sound
remains a mystery. With the aim of identifying a plausible minimal neural
circuit that captures this phenomenon, we investigate a firing rate model
consisting of two periodically forced neural populations coupled by fast direct
excitation and slow delayed inhibition. By analyzing the model in a non-smooth,
slow-fast regime we analytically prove the existence of a rich repertoire of
dynamical states and of their parameter dependent transitions. We impose
plausible parameter restrictions and link all states with perceptual
interpretations based on the detection of threshold crossings. Regions of
stimulus parameters occupied by states linked with each percept matches those
found in behavioral experiments. Our model suggests that slow inhibition masks
the perception of subsequent tones during segregation (forward masking), while
fast excitation enables integration for large pitch differences between the two
tones.

<p>It is commonly believed that networks cannot be both accurate and robust,
that gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed
that, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would
otherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present
evidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial
training. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function
significantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence
we propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its
smooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth
activation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples
and compute better gradient updates during adversarial training. Compared to
standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial robustness for "free",
i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in computational cost. For example,
without introducing additional computations, SAT significantly enhances
ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0% to 42.3%, while also improving accuracy by
0.9% on ImageNet. SAT also works well with larger networks: it helps
EfficientNet-L1 to achieve 82.2% accuracy and 58.6% robustness on ImageNet,
outperforming the previous state-of-the-art defense by 9.5% for accuracy and
11.6% for robustness.

<p>When dealing with continuous single-objective problems, multimodality poses
one of the biggest difficulties for global optimization. Local optima are often
preventing algorithms from making progress and thus pose a severe threat. In
this paper we analyze how single-objective optimization can benefit from
multiobjectivization by considering an additional objective. With the use of a
sophisticated visualization technique based on the multi-objective gradients,
the properties of the arising multi-objective landscapes are illustrated and
examined. We will empirically show that the multi-objective optimizer MOGSA is
able to exploit these properties to overcome local traps. The performance of
MOGSA is assessed on a testbed of several functions provided by the COCO
platform. The results are compared to the local optimizer Nelder-Mead.

<p>Numerical integration is a computational procedure that is widely encountered
across disciplines when reasoning about data. We derive a formula in closed
form to calculate the multidimensional integral of functions fw that are
representable using a shallow feed-forward neural network with weights w and a
sigmoid activation function. We demonstrate its applicability in estimating
numerical integration of arbitrary functions f over hyper-rectangular domains
in the absence of a prior. To achieve this, we first train the network to learn
$fw \approx f$ using point-samples of the integrand. We then use our formula to
calculate the exact integral of the learned function fw. Our formula operates
on the weights w of the trained approximator network. We show that this formula
can itself be expressed as a shallow feed-forward network, which we call a
Q-NET, with w as its inputs. Although the Q-NET does not have any learnable
parameters, we use this abstraction to derive a family of elegant parametric
formulae that represent the marginal distributions of the input function over
arbitrary subsets of input dimensions in functional form. We perform empirical
evaluations of Q-NETs for integrating smooth functions as well as functions
with discontinuities.

<p>We introduce a simple neural network architecture modification that enables
composite pattern learning, increases expressiveness, and reduces training
time. This expressibility improvement is explained by the density of the
modified architecture in a new refined local $L^p$-space describing composite
patterns. In contrast, most feed-forward neural network architectures with
sigmoid activation functions are shown not to be dense in this space. In
practice, restrictions have to be placed on the dimension of any architecture's
parameter space. $L^1$ approximation bounds are obtained in terms of the number
of the trainable parameters. Likewise, convergence guarantees are obtained as
the imposed restrictions are asymptotically removed. By exploiting the new
architecture's structure, a parallelizable training meta-algorithm is provided,
and numerical evaluations are made using the California housing dataset.

<p>Deep supervised neural networks trained to classify objects have emerged as
popular models of computation in the primate ventral stream. These models
represent information with a high-dimensional distributed population code,
implying that inferotemporal (IT) responses are also too complex to interpret
at the single-neuron level. We challenge this view by modelling neural
responses to faces in the macaque IT with a deep unsupervised generative model,
beta-VAE. Unlike deep classifiers, beta-VAE "disentangles" sensory data into
interpretable latent factors, such as gender or hair length. We found a
remarkable correspondence between the generative factors discovered by the
model and those coded by single IT neurons. Moreover, we were able to
reconstruct face images using the signals from just a handful of cells. This
suggests that the ventral visual stream may be optimising the disentangling
objective, producing a neural code that is low-dimensional and semantically
interpretable at the single-unit level.

<p>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the development of
artificial intelligence circuits and systems for edge computing applications.
In-memory computing mixed-signal neuromorphic architectures provide promising
ultra-low-power solutions for edge-computing sensory-processing applications,
thanks to their ability to emulate spiking neural networks in real-time. The
fine-grain parallelism offered by this approach allows such neural circuits to
process the sensory data efficiently by adapting their dynamics to the ones of
the sensed signals, without having to resort to the time-multiplexed computing
paradigm of von Neumann architectures. To reduce power consumption even
further, we present a set of mixed-signal analog/digital circuits that exploit
the features of advanced Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FDSOI)
integration processes. Specifically, we explore the options of advanced FDSOI
technologies to address analog design issues and optimize the design of the
synapse integrator and of the adaptive neuron circuits accordingly. We present
circuit simulation results and demonstrate the circuit's ability to produce
biologically plausible neural dynamics with compact designs, optimized for the
realization of large-scale spiking neural networks in neuromorphic processors.

<p>Attention mechanism has gained huge popularity due to its effectiveness in
achieving high accuracy in different domains. But attention is opportunistic
and is not justified by the content or usability of the content. Transformer
like structure creates all/any possible attention(s). We define segregating
strategies that can prioritize the contents for the applications for
enhancement of performance. We defined two strategies: Self-Segregating
Transformer (SST) and Coordinated-Segregating Transformer (CST) and used it to
solve visual question answering application. Self-segregation strategy for
attention contributes in better understanding and filtering the information
that can be most helpful for answering the question and create diversity of
visual-reasoning for attention. This work can easily be used in many other
applications that involve repetition and multiple frames of features and would
reduce the commonality of the attentions to a great extent. Visual Question
Answering (VQA) requires understanding and coordination of both images and
textual interpretations. Experiments demonstrate that segregation strategies
for cascaded multi-head transformer attention outperforms many previous works
and achieved considerable improvement for VQA-v2 dataset benchmark.

<p>Video captioning works on the two fundamental concepts, feature detection and
feature composition. While modern day transformers are beneficial in composing
features, they lack the fundamental problems of selecting and understanding of
the contents. As the feature length increases, it becomes increasingly
important to include provisions for improved capturing of the pertinent
contents. In this work, we have introduced a new concept of Self-Aware
Composition Transformer (SACT) that is capable of generating Multinomial
Attention (MultAtt) which is a way of generating distributions of various
combinations of frames. Also, multi-head attention transformer works on the
principle of combining all possible contents for attention, which is good for
natural language classification, but has limitations for video captioning.
Video contents have repetitions and require parsing of important contents for
better content composition. In this work, we have introduced SACT for more
selective attention and combined them for different attention heads for better
capturing of the usable contents for any applications. To address the problem
of diversification and encourage selective utilization, we propose the
Self-Aware Composition Transformer model for dense video captioning and apply
the technique on two benchmark datasets like ActivityNet and YouCookII.

<p>Quality-Diversity optimisation algorithms enable the evolution of collections
of both high-performing and diverse solutions. These collections offer the
possibility to quickly adapt and switch from one solution to another in case it
is not working as expected. It therefore finds many applications in real-world
domain problems such as robotic control. However, QD algorithms, like most
optimisation algorithms, are very sensitive to uncertainty on the fitness
function, but also on the behavioural descriptors. Yet, such uncertainties are
frequent in real-world applications. Few works have explored this issue in the
specific case of QD algorithms, and inspired by the literature in Evolutionary
Computation, mainly focus on using sampling to approximate the "true" value of
the performances of a solution. However, sampling approaches require a high
number of evaluations, which in many applications such as robotics, can quickly
become impractical. In this work, we propose Deep-Grid MAP-Elites, a variant of
the MAP-Elites algorithm that uses an archive of similar previously encountered
solutions to approximate the performance of a solution. We compare our approach
to previously explored ones on three noisy tasks: a standard optimisation task,
the control of a redundant arm and a simulated Hexapod robot. The experimental
results show that this simple approach is significantly more resilient to noise
on the behavioural descriptors, while achieving competitive performances in
terms of fitness optimisation, and being more sample-efficient than other
existing approaches.

<p>Biological neural networks face a formidable task: performing reliable
computations in the face of intrinsic stochasticity in individual neurons,
imprecisely specified synaptic connectivity, and nonnegligible delays in
synaptic transmission. A common approach to combatting such biological
heterogeneity involves averaging over large redundant networks of $N$ neurons
resulting in coding errors that decrease classically as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Recent
work demonstrated a novel mechanism whereby recurrent spiking networks could
efficiently encode dynamic stimuli, achieving a superclassical scaling in which
coding errors decrease as $1/N$. This specific mechanism involved two key
ideas: predictive coding, and a tight balance, or cancellation between strong
feedforward inputs and strong recurrent feedback. However, the theoretical
principles governing the efficacy of balanced predictive coding and its
robustness to noise, synaptic weight heterogeneity and communication delays
remain poorly understood. To discover such principles, we introduce an
analytically tractable model of balanced predictive coding, in which the degree
of balance and the degree of weight disorder can be dissociated unlike in
previous balanced network models, and we develop a mean field theory of coding
accuracy. Overall, our work provides and solves a general theoretical framework
for dissecting the differential contributions neural noise, synaptic disorder,
chaos, synaptic delays, and balance to the fidelity of predictive neural codes,
reveals the fundamental role that balance plays in achieving superclassical
scaling, and unifies previously disparate models in theoretical neuroscience.

<p>The neural plausibility of backpropagation has long been disputed, primarily
for its use of non-local weight transport $-$ the biologically dubious
requirement that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of
another. Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid
weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios
where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep
convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning
rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it
is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that
does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the
underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a
more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter
tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local
rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then
investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for
instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible "weight
estimation" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art
performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy
updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery
of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry:
further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across
architectures and the identification of biological implementations for
non-local learning mechanisms.

<p>Randomized smoothing is the current state-of-the-art defense with provable
robustness against $\ell_2$ adversarial attacks. Many works have devised new
randomized smoothing schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or
$\ell_\infty$; however, substantial effort was needed to derive such new
guarantees. This begs the question: can we find a general theory for randomized
smoothing?
</p>
<p>We propose a novel framework for devising and analyzing randomized smoothing
schemes, and validate its effectiveness in practice. Our theoretical
contributions are: (1) we show that for an appropriate notion of "optimal", the
optimal smoothing distributions for any "nice" norms have level sets given by
the norm's *Wulff Crystal*; (2) we propose two novel and complementary methods
for deriving provably robust radii for any smoothing distribution; and, (3) we
show fundamental limits to current randomized smoothing techniques via the
theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By combining (1) and (2), we significantly
improve the state-of-the-art certified accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard
datasets. Meanwhile, we show using (3) that with only label statistics under
random input perturbations, randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial
certified accuracy against perturbations of $\ell_p$-norm $\Omega(\min(1,
d^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}))$, when the input dimension $d$ is large. We

<p>Group invariant and equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), also known as
Equivariant Networks, have achieved remarkable success in learning on a variety
of data structures, such as sequences, images, sets, and graphs. Using tools
from group theory, this paper proves the universality of a broad class of
equivariant MLPs with a single hidden layer. In particular, it is shown that
having a hidden layer on which the group acts regularly is sufficient for
universal equivariance (invariance). A corollary is unconditional universality
of equivariant MLPs for Abelian groups, such as CNNs with a single hidden
layer. A second corollary is the universality of equivariant MLPs with a
high-order hidden layer, where we give both group-agnostic bounds and means for
calculating group-specific bounds on the order of hidden layer that guarantees
universal equivariance (invariance).

<p>People deploy top-down, goal-directed attention to accomplish tasks, such as
finding lost keys. By tuning the visual system to relevant information sources,
object recognition can become more efficient (a benefit) and more biased toward
the target (a potential cost). Motivated by selective attention in
categorisation models, we developed a goal-directed attention mechanism that
can process naturalistic (photographic) stimuli. Our attention mechanism can be
incorporated into any existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs). The
processing stages in DCNNs have been related to ventral visual stream. In that
light, our attentional mechanism incorporates top-down influences from
prefrontal cortex (PFC) to support goal-directed behaviour. Akin to how
attention weights in categorisation models warp representational spaces, we
introduce a layer of attention weights to a DCNN that amplify or attenuate
activity to further a goal. We evaluated the attentional mechanism using
photographic stimuli, varying the attentional target. We found that increasing
goal-directed attention has benefits (increasing hit rates) and costs
(increasing false alarm rates). At a moderate level, attention improves
sensitivity (i.e., increases $d^\prime$) at only a moderate increase in bias
for tasks involving standard images, blended images, and natural adversarial
images chosen to fool DCNNs. These results suggest that goal-directed attention
can reconfigure general-purpose DCNNs to better suit the current task goal,
much like PFC modulates activity along the ventral stream.

<p>The placement scheme of virtual machines (VMs) to physical servers (PSs) is
crucial to lowering operational cost for cloud providers. Evolutionary
algorithms (EAs) have been performed promising-solving on virtual machine
placement (VMP) problems in the past. However, as growing demand for cloud
services, the existing EAs fail to implement in large-scale virtual machine
placement (LVMP) problem due to the high time complexity and poor scalability.
Recently, the multi-factorial optimization (MFO) technology has surfaced as a
new search paradigm in evolutionary computing. It offers the ability to evolve
multiple optimization tasks simultaneously during the evolutionary process.
This paper aims to apply the MFO technology to the LVMP problem in
heterogeneous environment. Firstly, we formulate a deployment cost based VMP
problem in the form of the MFO problem. Then, a multi-factorial evolutionary
algorithm (MFEA) embedded with greedy-based allocation operator is developed to
address the established MFO problem. After that, a re-migration and merge
operator is designed to offer the integrated solution of the LVMP problem from
the solutions of MFO problem. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed
method, the simulation experiments are carried on large-scale and extra
large-scale VMs test data sets. The results show that compared with various
heuristic methods, our method could shorten optimization time significantly and
offer a competitive placement solution for the LVMP problem in heterogeneous
environment.

<p>Multi-tasking optimization can usually achieve better performance than
traditional single-tasking optimization through knowledge transfer between
tasks. However, current multi-tasking optimization algorithms have some
deficiencies. For high similarity problems, the knowledge that can accelerate
the convergence rate of tasks has not been fully taken advantages of. For low
similarity problems, the probability of generating negative transfer is high,
which may result in optimization performance degradation. In addition, some
knowledge transfer methods proposed previously do not fully consider how to
deal with the situation in which the population falls into local optimum. To
solve these issues, a two-stage adaptive knowledge transfer evolutionary
multi-tasking optimization algorithm based on population distribution, labeled
as EMT-PD, is proposed. EMT-PD can accelerate and improve the convergence
performance of tasks based on the knowledge extracted from the probability
model that reflects the search trend of the whole population. At the first
transfer stage, an adaptive weight is used to adjust the step size of
individual's search, which can reduce the impact of negative transfer. At the
second stage of knowledge transfer, the individual's search range is further
adjusted dynamically, which can improve the diversity of population and be
beneficial for jumping out of local optimum. Experimental results on
multi-tasking multi-objective optimization test suites show that EMT-PD is
superior to other six state-of-the-art evolutionary multi/single-tasking
algorithms. To further investigate the effectiveness of EMT-PD on
many-objective optimization problems, a multi-tasking many-objective test suite
is also designed in this paper. The experimental results on the new test suite
also demonstrate the competitiveness of EMT-PD.

<p>Aim: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality/morbidity and is associated with chronic neuroinflammation. Melanocortin receptor agonists including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ameliorate inflammation and provide a novel therapeutic approach. We examined the effect of long-acting cosyntropin (CoSyn), a synthetic ACTH analog, on the early inflammatory response and functional outcome following experimental TBI.</p><p>Methods: The controlled cortical impact model was used to induce TBI in mice. Mice were assigned to injury and treatment protocols resulting in four experimental groups including sham + saline, sham + CoSyn, TBI + saline, and TBI + CoSyn. Treatment was administered subcutaneously 3 h post-injury and daily injections were given for up to 7 days post-injury. The early inflammatory response was evaluated at 3 days post-injury through the evaluation of cytokine expression (IL1β and TNFα) and immune cell response. Quantification of immune cell response included cell counts of microglia/macrophages (Iba1+ cells) and neutrophils (MPO+ cells) in the cortex and hippocampus. Behavioral testing (n = 10–14 animals/group) included open field (OF) and novel object recognition (NOR) during the first week following injury and Morris water maze (MWM) at 10–15 days post-injury.</p><p>Results: Immune cell quantification showed decreased accumulation of Iba1+ cells in the perilesional cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus for CoSyn-treated TBI animals compared to saline-treated. Reduced numbers of MPO+ cells were also found in the perilesional cortex and hippocampus in CoSyn treated TBI mice compared to their saline-treated counterparts. Furthermore, CoSyn treatment reduced IL1β expression in the cortex of TBI mice. Behavioral testing showed a treatment effect of CoSyn for NOR with CoSyn increasing the discrimination ratio in both TBI and Sham groups, indicating increased memory performance. CoSyn also decreased latency to find platform during the early training period of the MWM when comparing CoSyn to saline-treated TBI mice suggesting moderate improvements in spatial memory following CoSyn treatment.</p><p>Conclusion: Reduced microglia/macrophage accumulation and neutrophil infiltration in conjunction with moderate improvements in spatial learning in our CoSyn treated TBI mice suggests a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of CoSyn following TBI.</p>

Objective<p>Asymmetry is a subtle but pervasive aspect of the human brain, which may be altered in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported that cerebral structural asymmetries are altered in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most of these studies were conducted at the region-of-interest level. At the functional level, there are few reports of resting-state functional asymmetries based on functional MRI. In this study, we investigated lateral differences in structural volumes and strengths of functional connectivity between individuals with AD and healthy controls (HCs) at the voxel level.</p>Methods<p>Forty-eight patients with AD and 32 matched HCs were assessed. An analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter volume was performed at the whole-brain level to explore anatomical cerebral asymmetries in AD. We then performed a seed-to-whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis to reveal FC asymmetries in AD. An asymmetry index (AI) was used to measure these changes, and the relationship between the structural and functional AIs and the clinical symptoms of AD was explored.</p>Results<p>A VBM analysis revealed a rightward and a leftward lateralization in the amygdala and the thalamus, respectively, in patients with AD. FC between the amygdala and the precuneus showed a rightward lateralization in AD, which was the opposite of the lateralization in the HCs. The asymmetric changes in structure and function were associated with disease severity and functional impairment in AD.</p>Conclusion<p>Our study highlights the value of considering asymmetries in the amygdala and the thalamus in clinical evaluations and their relevance to clinical measures.</p>

<p>Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key effector downstream of the Hippo signaling pathway and plays an important role in the development of the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS), especially regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of YAP in CNS diseases are still puzzling. Here, this review will systematically and comprehensively summarize the biological feature, pathological role, and underlying mechanisms of YAP in normal and pathologic CNS, which aims to provide insights into the potential molecular targets and new therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.</p>

<p>The brainstem is a posterior region of the brain, composed of three parts, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. It is critical in controlling heartbeat, blood pressure, and respiration, all of which are life-sustaining functions, and therefore, damages to or disorders of the brainstem can be lethal. Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) recapitulate the course of human brain development and are expected to be useful for medical research on central nervous system disorders. However, existing organoid models are limited in the extent hPSCs recapitulate human brain development and hence are not able to fully elucidate the diseases affecting various components of the brain such as brainstem. Here, we developed a method to generate human brainstem organoids (hBSOs), containing midbrain/hindbrain progenitors, noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons, and neural crest lineage cells. Single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) analysis, together with evidence from proteomics and electrophysiology, revealed that the cellular population in these organoids was similar to that of the human brainstem, which raises the possibility of making use of hBSOs in investigating central nervous system disorders affecting brainstem and in efficient drug screenings.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00253">Neural Processing of Narratives: From Individual Processing to Viral Propagation</a></h4>

<p>Narratives, in the form of, e.g., written stories, mouth-to-mouth accounts, audiobooks, fiction movies, and media-feeds, powerfully shape the perception of reality and widely influence human decision-making. In this review, we describe findings from recent neuroimaging studies unraveling how narratives influence the human brain, thus shaping perception, cognition, emotions, and decision-making. It appears that narrative sense-making relies on default-mode network (DMN) structures of the brain, especially precuneus. Activity in precuneus further seems to differ for fictitious vs. real narratives. Notably, high inter-subject correlation (ISC) of brain activity during narrative processing seems to predict the efficacy of a narrative. Factors that enhance the ISC of brain activity during narratives include higher levels of attention, emotional arousal, and negative emotional valence. Higher levels of attentional suspense seem to co-vary with activity in the temporoparietal junction, emotional arousal with activity in dorsal attention network, and negative emotional valence with activity in DMN. Lingering after-effects of emotional narratives have been further described in DMN, amygdala, and sensory cortical areas. Finally, inter-individual differences in personality, and cultural-background related analytical and holistic thinking styles, shape ISC of brain activity during narrative perception. Together, these findings offer promising leads for future studies elucidating the effects of narratives on the human brain, and how such effects might predict the efficacy of narratives in modulating decision-making.</p>

<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with exercise training can enhance learning and retention of hand tasks; however, there have been few investigations of the effects of tDCS on leg skill improvements. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tDCS paired with visuomotor step training can promote skill learning and retention. We hypothesized that pairing step training with anodal tDCS would improve skill learning and retention, evidenced by decreased step reaction times (RTs), both immediately (online skill gains) and 30 min after training (offline skill gains). Twenty healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of two groups, in which 20-min anodal or sham tDCS was applied to the lower limb motor cortex and paired with visuomotor step training. Step RTs were determined across three time points: (1) before brain stimulation (baseline); (2) immediately after brain stimulation (P0); and (3) 30 min after brain stimulation (P3). A continuous decline in RT was observed in the anodal tDCS group at both P0 and P3, with a significant decrease in RT at P3; whereas there were no improvements in RT at P0 and P3 in the sham group. These findings do not support our hypothesis that anodal tDCS enhances online learning, as RT was not decreased significantly immediately after stimulation. Nevertheless, the results indicate that anodal tDCS enhances offline learning, as RT was significantly decreased 30 min after stimulation, likely because of tDCS-induced neural modulation of cortical and subcortical excitability, synaptic efficacy, and spinal neuronal activity.</p>

<p>Effective central sensory integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive information is required to promote adaptability in response to changes in the environment during postural control. Patients with a lesion in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have an impaired ability to form an internal representation of body position, an important factor for postural control and adaptation. Suppression of PPC excitability has also been shown to decrease postural stability in some contexts. As of yet, it is unknown whether stimulation of the PPC may influence postural adaptation. This investigation aimed to identify whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the bilateral PPC could modulate postural adaptation in response to a bipedal incline postural adaptation task. Using young, healthy subjects, we delivered tDCS over bilateral PPC followed by bouts of inclined stance (incline-interventions). Analysis of postural after-effects identified differences between stimulation conditions for maximum lean after-effect (LAE; p = 0.005) as well as a significant interaction between condition and measurement period for the average position (p = 0.03). We identified impaired postural adaptability following both active stimulation conditions. Results reinforce the notion that the PPC is involved in motor adaptation and extend this line of research to the realm of standing posture. The results further highlight the role of the bilateral PPC in utilizing sensory feedback to update one’s internal representation of verticality and demonstrates the diffuse regions of the brain that are involved in postural control and adaptation. This information improves our understanding of the role of the cortex in postural control, highlighting the potential for the PPC as a target for sensorimotor rehabilitation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00238">Eavesdropping on Autobiographical Memory: A Naturalistic Observation Study of Older Adults’ Memory Sharing in Daily Conversations</a></h4>

<p>The retrieval of autobiographical memories is an integral part of everyday social interactions. Prior laboratory research has revealed that older age is associated with a reduction in the retrieval of autobiographical episodic memories, and the ability to elaborate these memories with episodic details. However, how age-related reductions in episodic specificity unfold in everyday social contexts remains largely unknown. Also, constraints of the laboratory-based approach have limited our understanding of how autobiographical semantic memory is linked to older age. To address these gaps in knowledge, we used a smartphone application known as the Electronically Activated Recorder, or “EAR,” to unobtrusively capture real-world conversations over 4 days. In a sample of 102 cognitively normal older adults, we extracted instances where memories and future thoughts were shared by the participants, and we scored the shared episodic memories and future thoughts for their make-up of episodic and semantic detail. We found that older age was associated with a reduction in real-world sharing of autobiographical episodic and semantic memories. We also found that older age was linked to less episodically and semantically detailed descriptions of autobiographical episodic memories. Frequency and level of detail of shared future thoughts yielded weaker relationships with age, which may be related to the low frequency of future thoughts in general. Similar to laboratory research, there was no correlation between autobiographical episodic detail sharing and a standard episodic memory test. However, in contrast to laboratory studies, episodic detail production while sharing autobiographical episodic memories was weakly related to episodic detail production while describing future events, unrelated to working memory, and not different between men and women. Overall, our findings provide novel evidence of how older age relates to episodic specificity when autobiographical memories are assessed unobtrusively and objectively “in the wild.”</p>

Purpose<p>This study aimed to investigate the spectral and spatial signatures of neuromagnetic activity underlying the termination of absence seizures.</p>Methods<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 18 drug-naive patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Accumulated source imaging (ASI) was used to analyze MEG data at the source level in seven frequency ranges: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), gamma (30–80 Hz), ripple (80–250 Hz), and fast ripple (250–500 Hz).</p>Result<p>In the 1–4, 4–8, and 8–12 Hz ranges, the magnetic source during seizure termination appeared to be consistent over the ictal period and was mainly localized in the frontal cortex (FC) and parieto-occipito-temporal junction (POT). In the 12–30 and 30–80 Hz ranges, a significant reduction in source activity was observed in the frontal lobe during seizure termination as well as a decrease in peak source strength. The ictal peak source strength in the 1–4 Hz range was negatively correlated with the ictal duration of the seizure, whereas in the 30–80 Hz range, it was positively correlated with the course of epilepsy.</p>Conclusion<p>The termination of absence seizures is associated with a dynamic neuromagnetic process. Frequency-dependent changes in the FC were observed during seizure termination, which may be involved in the process of neural network interaction. Neuromagnetic activity in different frequency bands may play different roles in the pathophysiological mechanism during absence seizures.</p>

<p>Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder in adults, and can often be medically refractory, requiring surgical intervention. MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a less invasive procedure that uses ultrasonic waves to induce lesions in the ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) to treat refractory ET. As with all procedures for treating ET, optimal targeting during MRgFUS is essential for efficacy and durability. Various studies have reported cases of tremor recurrence following MRgFUS and long-term outcome data is limited to 3–4 years. We present a tractography-based investigation on a case of DBS rescue for medically refractory ET that was treated with MRgFUS that was interrupted due to the development of dysarthria during the procedure. After initial improvement, her hand tremor started to recur within 6 months after treatment, and bilateral DBS was performed targeting the VIM 24 months after MRgFUS. DBS induced long-term tremor control with monopolar stimulation. Diffusion MRI tractography was used to reconstruct the dentatorubrothalamic (DRTT) and corticothalmic (CTT) tracts being modulated by the procedures to understand the variability in efficacy between MRgFUS and DBS in treating ET in our patient. By comparing the MRgFUS lesion and DBS volume of activated tissue (VAT), we found that the MRgFUS lesion was located ventromedially to the VAT, and was less than 10% of the size of the VAT. While the lesion encompassed the same proportion of DRTT streamlines, it encompassed fewer CTT streamlines than the VAT. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation of targeting the CTT when using neuromodulatory procedures to treat refractory ET for more permanent tremor relief.</p>

The proposed system was evaluated on simulated calcium imaging data, calcium imaging data with manual annotation, and calcium imaging data of the anterior lateral motor cortex. We found that the proposed system accurately detected neurons and extracted neural activities in real time without any requirement for expensive, cumbersome, or special-purpose computing hardware. We expect that the system will enable cost-effective, real-time calcium imaging-based neural decoding, leading to precise neuromodulation.</p>

<p>Neuron classification is an important component in analyzing network structure and quantifying the effect of neuron topology on signal processing. Current quantification and classification approaches rely on morphology projection onto lower-dimensional spaces. In this paper a 3D visualization and quantification tool is presented. The Density Visualization Pipeline (DVP) computes, visualizes and quantifies the density distribution, i.e., the “mass” of interneurons. We use the DVP to characterize and classify a set of GABAergic interneurons. Classification of GABAergic interneurons is of crucial importance to understand on the one hand their various functions and on the other hand their ubiquitous appearance in the neocortex. 3D density map visualization and projection to the one-dimensional x, y, z subspaces show a clear distinction between the studied cells, based on these metrics. The DVP can be coupled to computational studies of the behavior of neurons and networks, in which network topology information is derived from DVP information. The DVP reads common neuromorphological file formats, e.g., Neurolucida XML files, NeuroMorpho.orgSWC files and plain ASCII files. Full 3D visualization and projections of the density to 1D and 2D manifolds are supported by the DVP. All routines are embedded within the visual programming IDE VRL-Studio for Java which allows the definition and rapid modification of analysis workflows.</p>

<p>In the healthy brain, neuronal excitability and synaptic strength are homeostatically regulated to keep neuronal network activity within physiological boundaries. Epilepsy is characterized by episodes of highly synchronized firing across in widespread neuronal populations, due to a failure in regulation of network activity. Here we consider epilepsy as a failure of homeostatic plasticity or as a maladaptive response to perturbations in the activity. How homeostatic compensation is involved in epileptogenic processes or in the chronic phase of epilepsy, is still debated. Although several theories have been proposed, there is relatively little experimental evidence to evaluate them. In this perspective, we will discuss recent results that shed light on the potential role of homeostatic plasticity in epilepsy. First, we will present some recent insights on how homeostatic compensations are probably active before and during epileptogenesis and how their actions are temporally regulated and closely dependent on the progression of pathology. Then, we will consider the dual role of transcriptional regulation during epileptogenesis, and finally, we will underline the importance of homeostatic plasticity in the context of therapeutic interventions for epilepsy. While classic pharmacological interventions may be counteracted by the epileptic brain to maintain its potentially dysfunctional set point, novel therapeutic approaches may provide the neuronal network with the tools necessary to restore its physiological balance.</p>

<p>Neurons must establish and stabilize connections made with diverse targets, each with distinct demands and functional characteristics. At Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), synaptic strength remains stable in a manipulation that simultaneously induces hypo-innervation on one target and hyper-innervation on the other. However, the expression mechanisms that achieve this exquisite target-specific homeostatic control remain enigmatic. Here, we identify the distinct target-specific homeostatic expression mechanisms. On the hypo-innervated target, an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance is sufficient to compensate for reduced innervation, without any apparent presynaptic adaptations. In contrast, a target-specific reduction in presynaptic neurotransmitter release probability is reflected by a decrease in active zone components restricted to terminals of hyper-innervated targets. Finally, loss of postsynaptic GluRs on one target induces a compartmentalized, homeostatic enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release called presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) that can be precisely balanced with the adaptations required for both hypo- and hyper-innervation to maintain stable synaptic strength. Thus, distinct anterograde and retrograde signaling systems operate at pre- and post-synaptic compartments to enable target-specific, homeostatic control of neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Slit1 is a secreted axon guidance molecule, also involved in adult neurogenesis. In physiological conditions, Slit1 loss promotes ectopic dispersal of SVZ-derived neural precursors (SVZ-NPCs) into periventricular structures such as the corpus callosum. Demyelination of the corpus callosum triggers SVZ-NPC migration to ectopic locations and their recruitment by the lesion, suggesting a possible role for Slit1 in SVZ-NPCs ectopic dispersal regulation in pathological conditions. Here, we have investigated the function of Slit1 protein in the recruitment of SVZ-NPCs after CNS demyelination. We find that the dynamics of oligodendrogenesis and temporal profile of developmental myelination in Slit1<sup>–/–</sup> mice are similar to Slit1<sup>+/−</sup> controls. SVZ micro-dissection and RT-PCR from wild-type mice, show that Slits and Robos are physiologically regulated at the transcriptional level in response to corpus callosum demyelination suggesting their role in the process of SVZ-NPC ectopic migration in demyelinating conditions. Moreover, we find that the number of SVZ-NPCs recruited by the lesion increases in Sli1<sup>–/–</sup> mice compared to Slit1<sup>+/−</sup> mice, leading to higher numbers of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells within the lesion. Time-lapse video-microscopy of immuno-purified NPCs shows that Slit1-deficient cells migrate faster and make more frequent directional changes than control NPCs, supporting a cell-autonomous mechanism of action of Slit1 in NPC migration. In conclusion, while Slit1 does not affect the normal developmental process of oligodendrogenesis and myelination, it regulates adult SVZ-NPC ectopic migration in response to demyelination, and consequently oligodendrocyte renewal within the lesion.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of children with late diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism and cognitive alterations such as abnormal verbal memory processing suggest altered telencephalic commissural connections. The corpus callosum (CC) is the major inter-hemispheric commissure that contra-laterally connects neocortical areas. However, in late diagnosed neonates with congenital hypothyroidism, the possible effect of early transient and chronic postnatal hypothyroidism still remains unknown. We have studied the development of the anterior, middle and posterior CC, using in vivo MRI and electron microscopy in hypothyroid and control male rats. Four groups of methimazole (MMI) treated rats were studied. One group, as a model for early transient hypothyroidism, was MMI-treated from postnatal day (P) 0 to P21; some of these rats were also treated with L-thyroxine (T4) from P15 to 21. Another group modeling chronic hypothyroid, were treated with MMI from P0 to 150 and from embryonic day 10 to P170. The results obtained from these groups were compared with same age control rats. The normalized T2 signal obtained using MRI was higher in MMI-treated rats and correlated with a low number and percentage of myelinated axons. The number and density of myelinated axons decreased in transient and chronic hypothyroid rats at P150. The g-ratio (inner to outer diameter ratio) and the estimated conduction velocity of myelinated axons were similar between MMI-treated and controls, but the conduction delay decreased in the posterior CC of MMI-treated rats compared to controls. These data show that early postnatal transient and chronic hypothyroidism alters CC maturation in a way that may affect the callosal transfer of information. These alterations cannot be reversed after delayed T4-treatment. Our data support the findings of neurocognitive delay in late T4-treated children with congenital hypothyroidism.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56945">Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase in ER-associated protein degradation</a></h4>

In endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling on polyubiquitinated substrates. How hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not known. Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals) is a retrotranslocase that facilitates membrane protein extraction. A substrate’s TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Their unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. Our results reveal how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55813">Diversity-decomposition relationships in forests worldwide</a></h4>

Plant species diversity affects carbon and nutrient cycling during litter decomposition, yet the generality of the direction of this effect and its magnitude remain uncertain. With a meta-analysis including 65 field studies across the Earth's major forest ecosystems, we show here that decomposition was faster when litter was composed of more than one species. These positive biodiversity effects were mostly driven by temperate forests, but were more variable in other forests. Litter mixture effects emerged most strongly in early decomposition stages and were related to divergence in litter quality. Litter diversity also accelerated nitrogen, but not phosphorus release, potentially indicating a decoupling of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling and perhaps a shift in ecosystem nutrient limitation with changing biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of litter diversity effects for carbon and nutrient dynamics during decomposition, and show how these effects vary with litter traits, decomposer complexity and forest characteristics.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55659">Biodiversity mediates the effects of stressors but not nutrients on litter decomposition</a></h4>

Understanding the consequences of ongoing biodiversity changes for ecosystems is a pressing challenge. Controlled biodiversity-ecosystem function experiments with random biodiversity loss scenarios have demonstrated that more diverse communities usually provide higher levels of ecosystem functioning. However, it is not clear if these results predict the ecosystem consequences of environmental changes that cause non-random alterations in biodiversity and community composition. We synthesized 69 independent studies reporting 660 observations of the impacts of two pervasive drivers of global change (chemical stressors and nutrient enrichment) on animal and microbial decomposer diversity and litter decomposition. Using meta-analysis and structural equation modelling, we show that declines in decomposer diversity and abundance explain reduced litter decomposition in response to stressors but not to nutrients. While chemical stressors generally reduced biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, detrimental effects of nutrients occurred only at high levels of nutrient inputs. Thus, more intense environmental change does not always result in stronger responses, illustrating the complexity of ecosystem consequences of biodiversity change. Overall, these findings provide strong evidence that the consequences of observed biodiversity change for ecosystems depend on the kind of environmental change, and are especially significant when human activities decrease biodiversity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55294">Different methods of fear reduction are supported by distinct cortical substrates</a></h4>

Understanding how learned fear can be reduced is at the heart of treatments for anxiety disorders. Tremendous progress has been made in this regard through extinction training in which the aversive outcome is omitted. However, current progress almost entirely rests on this single paradigm, resulting in a very specialized knowledgebase at the behavioural and neural level of analysis. Here, we used a dual-paradigm approach to show that different methods that lead to reduction in learned fear in rats are dissociated in the cortex. We report that the infralimbic cortex has a very specific role in fear reduction that depends on the omission of aversive events but not on overexpectation. The orbitofrontal cortex, a structure generally overlooked in fear, is critical for downregulating fear when novel predictions about upcoming aversive events are generated, such as when fear is inflated or overexpected, but less so when an expected aversive event is omitted.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes mortality and disability worldwide. It can initiate acute cell death followed by secondary injury induced by microglial activation, oxidative stress, inflammation and autophagy in brain tissue, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits. We evaluated a new pomalidomide (Pom) analog, 3,6'-dithioPom (DP), and Pom as immunomodulatory agents to mitigate TBI-induced cell death, neuroinflammation, astrogliosis and behavioral impairments in rats challenged with controlled cortical impact TBI. Both agents significantly reduced the injury contusion volume and degenerating neuron number evaluated histochemically and by MRI at 24 hr and 7 days, with a therapeutic window of 5 hr post-injury. TBI-induced upregulated markers of microglial activation, astrogliosis and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, iNOS, COX-2, and autophagy-associated proteins were suppressed, leading to an amelioration of behavioral deficits with DP providing greater potency. Complementary animal and cellular studies demonstrated DP and Pom mediated reductions in markers of neuroinflammation and a-synuclein-induced toxicity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54540">A Matlab-based toolbox for characterizing behavior of rodents engaged in string-pulling</a></h4>

String-pulling by rodents is a behavior in which animals make rhythmical body, head, and bilateral forearm as well as skilled hand movements to spontaneously reel in a string. Typical analysis includes kinematic assessment of hand movements done by manually annotating frames. Here, we describe a Matlab® based software that allows whole-body motion characterization using optical flow estimation, descriptive statistics, principal component, and independent component analyses as well as temporal measures of Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension. Based on image-segmentation and heuristic algorithms for object tracking, the software also allows tracking of body, ears, nose, and forehands for estimation of kinematic parameters such as body length, body angle, head roll, head yaw, head pitch, and path and speed of hand movements. The utility of the task and software is demonstrated by characterizing postural and hand kinematic differences in string-pulling behavior of two strains of mice, C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54026">A decentralised neural model explaining optimal integration of navigational strategies in insects</a></h4>

Insect navigation arises from the coordinated action of concurrent guidance systems but the neural mechanisms through which each functions, and are then coordinated, remains unknown. We propose that insects require distinct strategies to retrace familiar routes (route-following) and directly return from novel to familiar terrain (homing) using different aspects of frequency encoded views that are processed in different neural pathways. We also demonstrate how the Central Complex and Mushroom Bodies regions of the insect brain may work in tandem to coordinate the directional output of different guidance cues through a contextually switched ring-attractor inspired by neural recordings. The resultant unified model of insect navigation reproduces behavioural data from a series of cue conflict experiments in realistic animal environments and offers testable hypotheses of where and how insects process visual cues, utilise the different information that they provide and coordinate their outputs to achieve the adaptive behaviours observed in the wild.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53445">Estimating and interpreting nonlinear receptive field of sensory neural responses with deep neural network models</a></h4>

Our understanding of nonlinear stimulus transformations by neural circuits is hindered by the lack of comprehensive yet interpretable computational modeling frameworks. Here, we propose a data-driven approach based on deep neural networks to directly model arbitrarily nonlinear stimulus-response mappings. Reformulating the exact function of a trained neural network as a collection of stimulus-dependent linear functions enables a locally linear receptive field interpretation of the neural network. Predicting the neural responses recorded invasively from the auditory cortex of neurosurgical patients as they listened to speech, this approach significantly improves the prediction accuracy of auditory cortical responses, particularly in nonprimary areas. Moreover, interpreting the functions learned by neural networks uncovered three distinct types of nonlinear transformations of speech that varied considerably from primary to nonprimary auditory regions. The ability of this framework to capture arbitrary stimulus-response mappings while maintaining model interpretability leads to a better understanding of cortical processing of sensory signals.

<p>by Donghoon Lee, Jing Zhang, Jason Liu, Mark Gerstein</p>

Alternative RNA splicing provides an important means to expand metazoan transcriptome diversity. Contrary to what was accepted previously, splicing is now thought to predominantly take place during transcription. Motivated by emerging data showing the physical proximity of the spliceosome to Pol II, we surveyed the effect of epigenetic context on co-transcriptional splicing. In particular, we observed that splicing factors were not necessarily enriched at exon junctions and that most epigenetic signatures had a distinctly asymmetric profile around known splice sites. Given this, we tried to build an interpretable model that mimics the physical layout of splicing regulation where the chromatin context progressively changes as the Pol II moves along the guide DNA. We used a recurrent-neural-network architecture to predict the inclusion of a spliced exon based on adjacent epigenetic signals, and we showed that distinct spatio-temporal features of these signals were key determinants of model outcome, in addition to the actual nucleotide sequence of the guide DNA strand. After the model had been trained and tested (with &gt;80% precision-recall curve metric), we explored the derived weights of the latent factors, finding they highlight the importance of the asymmetric time-direction of chromatin context during transcription.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TQRYXG8jUVE" width="1" />

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is associated with cartilage degradation, ultimately leading to disability and decrease of quality of life. Two key mechanisms have been suggested to occur in PTOA: tissue inflammation and abnormal biomechanical loading. Both mechanisms have been suggested to result in loss of cartilage proteoglycans, the source of tissue fixed charge density (FCD). In order to predict the simultaneous effect of these degrading mechanisms on FCD content, a computational model has been developed. We simulated spatial and temporal changes of FCD content in injured cartilage using a novel finite element model that incorporates (1) diffusion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 into tissue, and (2) the effect of excessive levels of shear strain near chondral defects during physiologically relevant loading. Cytokine-induced biochemical cartilage explant degradation occurs near the sides, top, and lesion, consistent with the literature. In turn, biomechanically-driven FCD loss is predicted near the lesion, in accordance with experimental findings: regions near lesions showed significantly more FCD depletion compared to regions away from lesions (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01). Combined biochemical and biomechanical degradation is found near the free surfaces and especially near the lesion, and the corresponding bulk FCD loss agrees with experiments. We suggest that the presence of lesions plays a role in cytokine diffusion-driven degradation, and also predisposes cartilage for further biomechanical degradation. Models considering both these cartilage degradation pathways concomitantly are promising <i>in silico</i> tools for predicting disease progression, recognizing lesions at high risk, simulating treatments, and ultimately optimizing treatments to postpone the development of PTOA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I4C0ko5UtRQ" width="1" />

<p>by Garikoitz Lerma-Usabiaga, Noah Benson, Jonathan Winawer, Brian A. Wandell</p>

Neuroimaging software methods are complex, making it a near certainty that some implementations will contain errors. Modern computational techniques (i.e., public code and data repositories, continuous integration, containerization) enable the reproducibility of the analyses and reduce coding errors, but they do not guarantee the scientific validity of the results. It is difficult, nay impossible, for researchers to check the accuracy of software by reading the source code; ground truth test datasets are needed. Computational reproducibility means providing software so that for the same input anyone obtains the same result, right or wrong. Computational validity means obtaining the right result for the ground-truth test data. We describe a framework for validating and sharing software implementations, and we illustrate its usage with an example application: population receptive field (pRF) methods for functional MRI data. The framework is composed of three main components implemented with containerization methods to guarantee computational reproducibility. In our example pRF application, those components are: (1) synthesis of fMRI time series from ground-truth pRF parameters, (2) implementation of four public pRF analysis tools and standardization of inputs and outputs, and (3) report creation to compare the results with the ground truth parameters. The framework was useful in identifying realistic conditions that lead to imperfect parameter recovery in all four pRF implementations, that would remain undetected using classic validation methods. We provide means to mitigate these problems in future experiments. A computational validation framework supports scientific rigor and creativity, as opposed to the oft-repeated suggestion that investigators rely upon a few agreed upon packages. We hope that the framework will be helpful to validate other critical neuroimaging algorithms, as having a validation framework helps (1) developers to build new software, (2) research scientists to verify the software’s accuracy, and (3) reviewers to evaluate the methods used in publications and grants.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b9TZVWhwLBs" width="1" />

<p>by Hadi Rahmaninejad, Tom Pace, Shashank Bhatt, Bin Sun, Peter Kekenes-Huskey</p>

Nucleotides comprise small molecules that perform critical signaling roles in biological systems. Adenosine-based nucleotides, including adenosine tri-, di-, and mono-phosphate, are controlled through their rapid degradation by diphosphohydrolases and ecto-nucleotidases (NDAs). The interplay between nucleotide signaling and degradation is especially important in synapses formed between cells, which create signaling ‘nanodomains’. Within these ‘nanodomains’, charged nucleotides interact with densely-packed membranes and biomolecules. While the contributions of electrostatic and steric interactions within such nanodomains are known to shape diffusion-limited reaction rates, less is understood about how these factors control the kinetics of nucleotidase activity. To quantify these factors, we utilized reaction-diffusion numerical simulations of 1) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and 2) AMP into adenosine (Ado) via two representative nucleotidases, CD39 and CD73. We evaluate these sequentially-coupled reactions in nanodomain geometries representative of extracellular synapses, within which we localize the nucleotidases. With this model, we find that 1) nucleotidase confinement reduces reaction rates relative to an open (bulk) system, 2) the rates of AMP and ADO formation are accelerated by restricting the diffusion of substrates away from the enzymes, and 3) nucleotidase co-localization and the presence of complementary (positive) charges to ATP enhance reaction rates, though the impact of these contributions on nucleotide pools depends on the degree to which the membrane competes for substrates. As a result, these contributions integratively control the relative concentrations and distributions of ATP and its metabolites within the junctional space. Altogether, our studies suggest that CD39 and CD73 nucleotidase activity within junctional spaces can exploit their confinement and favorable electrostatic interactions to finely control nucleotide signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l36QJ9G5Tio" width="1" />

Seasonal influenza A viruses of humans evolve rapidly due to strong selection pressures from host immune responses, principally on the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein. Based on mouse transmission experiments, a proposed mechanism for immune evasion consists of increased avidity to host cellular receptors, mediated by electrostatic charge interactions with negatively charged cell surfaces. In support of this, the HA charge of the globally circulating H3N2 has increased over time since its pandemic. However, the same trend was not seen in H1N1 HA sequences. This is counter-intuitive, since immune escape due to increased avidity (due itself to an increase in charge) was determined experimentally. Here, we explore whether patterns of local charge of H1N1 HA can explain this discrepancy and thus further associate electrostatic charge with immune escape and viral evolutionary dynamics. Measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge computed from deep mutational scan data on an early H1N1 HA yield a striking division of residues into three groups, separated by charge. We then explored evolutionary dynamics of these groups from 1918 to 2008. In particular, one group increases in net charge over time and consists of sites that are evolving the fastest, that are closest to the receptor binding site (RBS), and that are exposed to solvent (i.e., on the surface). By contrast, another group decreases in net charge and consists of sites that are further away from the RBS and evolving slower, but also exposed to solvent. The last group consists of those sites in the HA core, with no change in net charge and that evolve very slowly. Thus, there is a group of residues that follows the same trend as seen for the entire H3N2 HA. It is possible that the H1N1 HA is under other biophysical constraints that result in compensatory decreases in charge elsewhere on the protein. Our results implicate localized charge in HA interactions with host cells, and highlight how deep mutational scan data can inform evolutionary hypotheses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PtxpNxSaxPs" width="1" />

<p>by Jesús R. Requena</p>

The prion protein, PrP, can adopt at least 2 conformations, the overwhelmingly prevalent cellular conformation (PrP<sup>C</sup>) and the scrapie conformation (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). PrP<sup>C</sup> features a globular C-terminal domain containing 3 α-helices and a short β-sheet and a long flexible N-terminal tail whose exact conformation in vivo is not yet known and a metastable subdomain with β-strand propensity has been identified within it. The PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation is very rare and has the characteristics of an amyloid. Furthermore, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is a prion, i.e., it is infectious. This involves 2 steps: (1) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can template PrP<sup>C</sup> and coerce it to adopt the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation and (2) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be transmitted between individuals, by oral, parenteral, and other routes and thus propagate as an infectious agent. However, this is a simplification: On the one hand, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is not a single conformation, but rather, a set of alternative similar but distinct conformations. Furthermore, other amyloid conformations of PrP exist with different biochemical and propagative properties. In this issue of <i>PLOS Biology</i>, Asante and colleagues describe the first murine model of familial human prion disease and demonstrate the emergence and propagation of 2 PrP amyloid conformers. Of these, one causes neurodegeneration, whereas the other does not. With its many conformers, PrP is a truly protean protein.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yKs_HtPxU78" width="1" />

Mitigating the threat of insecticide resistance in African malaria vector populations requires comprehensive information about where resistance occurs, to what degree, and how this has changed over time. Estimating these trends is complicated by the sparse, heterogeneous distribution of observations of resistance phenotypes in field populations. We use 6,423 observations of the prevalence of resistance to the most important vector control insecticides to inform a Bayesian geostatistical ensemble modelling approach, generating fine-scale predictive maps of resistance phenotypes in mosquitoes from the <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> complex across Africa. Our models are informed by a suite of 111 predictor variables describing potential drivers of selection for resistance. Our maps show alarming increases in the prevalence of resistance to pyrethroids and DDT across sub-Saharan Africa from 2005 to 2017, with mean mortality following insecticide exposure declining from almost 100% to less than 30% in some areas, as well as substantial spatial variation in resistance trends.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/9dyT9sprNO4" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) is required for maintaining peripheral sensory neuron survival and function; however, the underlying cellular mechanism remains unclear. The general view is that expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by the neuron itself is required for maintaining sensory neuron survival and myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Adopting a neuronal‐specific conditional knockout strategy, we demonstrate the partial depletion of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in neurons exerts little influence upon maintaining sensory neuron survival and peripheral nerve myelination in health and after demyelinating neuropathy. Our data show that the density and total number of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in 2‐month‐old mice is not affected following the deletion of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in large‐diameter myelinating neurons, as assessed by stereology. Adopting experimental autoimmune neuritis induced in adult male mice, an animal model of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, we identify that deleting p75<sup>NTR</sup> in myelinating neurons exerts no influence upon the disease progression, the total number of DRG neurons, and the extent of myelin damage in the sciatic nerve, indicating that the expression of neuronal p75<sup>NTR</sup> is not essential for maintaining peripheral neuron survival and myelination after a demyelinating insult <i>in vivo </i>. Together, results of this study suggest that the survival and myelination of peripheral sensory neurons is independent of p75<sup>NTR</sup> expressed by a subtype of neurons <i>in vivo </i>. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the mechanism underpinning p75<sup>NTR</sup>‐mediated neuronal survival in the PNS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has long been observed to encode a representation of an animal's position in space. Recent evidence suggests that the nature of this representation is somewhat predictive and can be modeled by learning a successor representation (SR) between distinct positions in an environment. However, this discretization of space is subjective making it difficult to formulate predictions about how some environmental manipulations should impact the hippocampal representation. Here, we present a model of place and grid cell firing as a consequence of learning a SR from a basis set of known neurobiological features—boundary vector cells (BVCs). The model describes place cell firing as the successor features of the SR, with grid cells forming a low‐dimensional representation of these successor features. We show that the place and grid cells generated using the BVC‐SR model provide a good account of biological data for a variety of environmental manipulations, including dimensional stretches, barrier insertions, and the influence of environmental geometry on the hippocampal representation of space.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is supporting evidence of alcohol negative effects on the brain: neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies finding anatomical and functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with the dependence process. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate brain FC and network characteristics of alcohol‐dependent individuals in resting state. For this study, we included males diagnosed with alcohol dependence (<i>N </i> = 25) and a group of healthy individuals (<i>N </i> = 23). Simultaneous EEG‐MEG (electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic) activity was recorded in 5 min of eyes‐closed resting state. EEG‐MEG activity was preprocessed and FC was computed through the leakage‐corrected version of phase locking value (ciPLV). Additionally, local (degree, efficiency, clustering) and global (efficiency, characteristic path length) network parameters were computed. Connectivity analysis showed an increase in phase‐lagged synchronization, mainly between frontal and frontotemporal regions, in high beta band, and a decrease in interhemispheric gamma, for alcohol‐dependent individuals. Network analysis revealed intergroup differences at the local level for high beta, indicating higher degree, clustering, and efficiency, mostly at frontal nodes, together with a decrease in these measures at more posterior sites for patients’ group. The hyper‐synchronization in beta, next to the hypo‐synchronization in gamma, could indicate an alteration in communication between hemispheres, but also a possible functional compensation mechanism in neural circuits. This could be also supported by network characteristic data, where local alterations in communication are observed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25831?af=R">Anti‐migraine CGRP receptor antagonists worsen cerebral ischemic outcome in mice</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>CGRP pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP‐mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12–60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1–1 mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10–100 mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, <i>in vitro </i>.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Olcegepant (1 mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12‐ to 20‐minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 versus 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk 2.21, p &lt; 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (p &lt; 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score 9 versus 5 with vehicle, p = 0.008) after 60‐minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1‐1 mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10 mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20‐minute ischemia (p = 0.03); 100 mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60‐minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1 mg/kg increased infarct size after 30‐minute occlusion (1.6‐fold, p = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10‐fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse aorta.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. <i>In vivo </i> studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with patients' or controls' CSF through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In cultured neurons, patients' CSF, but not controls' CSF, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, patients' CSF caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of patients' CSF stopped.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters.</p>

<p>Reducing the extent of secondary degeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) is necessary to preserve function, but treatment options have thus far been limited. A combination of the ion channel inhibitors Lomerizine (Lom), YM872 and oxATP, to inhibit voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable AMPA receptors, and purinergic P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors respectively, effectively limits secondary consequences of injury in in vitro and in vivo models of CNS injury. Here, we investigated the efficacy of these inhibitors in a clinically relevant model of SCI. Fischer (F344) rats were subjected to a moderate (150 kD) contusive SCI at thoracic level T10 and assessed at 2 weeks or 10 weeks post-injury. Lom was delivered orally twice daily and YM872 and oxATP were delivered via osmotic mini-pump implanted at the time of SCI until 2 weeks following injury. Open field locomotion analysis revealed that treatment with the three inhibitors in combination improved the rate of functional recovery of the hind limb (compared to controls) as early as 1-day post-injury, with beneficial effects persisting to 14 days post-injury, while all three inhibitors were present. At 2 weeks following combinatorial treatment, the functional improvement was associated with significantly decreased cyst size, increased immunoreactivity of β-III tubulin<sup>+ve</sup> axons, myelin basic protein, and reduced lipid peroxidation by-products, and increased CC1<sup>+ve</sup> oligodendrocytes and NG2<sup>+ve</sup>/PDGFα<sup>+ve</sup> oligodendrocyte progenitor cell densities, compared to vehicle-treated SCI animals. The combination of Lom, oxATP, and YM872 shows preclinical promise for control of secondary degeneration following SCI, and further investigation of long-term sustained treatment is warranted.</p>

<p>This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of stroke and to explore the effect of miR-224-5p in hypoxic cortical neurons. Firstly, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model with Sprague–Dawley rats. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed the brain infarction of an MCAO rat. Longa scores of rats were significantly increased in 12th, 24th, and 48th hours after MCAO. Then, we found that miR-224-5p was increased after MCAO in rats by qRT-PCR. In order to investigate the effect of miR-224-5p in hypoxic neurons, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model with cortical neurons. MiR-224-5p was also upregulated in neurons after OGD by qRT-PCR. After transfection of the miR-224-5p inhibitor, the number of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) in comparison to the anti-NC group. Furthermore, Tuj1<sup>+</sup> (neuronal marker) staining and TUNEL assay (to detect apoptotic cells) were performed in neurons. The survival of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group was significantly improved (P &lt; 0.01), while the apoptosis of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), when compared with that of the anti-NC group. In addition, we predicted that potential target genes of miR-224-5p were nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), and ring finger protein 38 (RNF38) with bioinformatics databases, such as TargetScan, miRDB, miRmap, and miRanda. The result of qRT-PCR confirmed that NR4A1 was significantly decreased after hypoxic injury (P &lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, luciferase reporter’s assay indicated that NR4A1 was the direct target of miR-224-5p. Compared with the anti-miR-224-5p + siNC group, the number of cortical neurons and the length of the neuron axon in the anti-miR-224-5p + si-NR4A1 group were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), and the number of neuronal apoptosis in the anti-miR-224-5p + si-NR4A1 group was increased (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, miR-224-5p played a crucial role in hypoxic neuron injury through NR4A1, which might be an important regulatory mechanism in OGD injury of neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00612">Alpha-Lipoic Acid Mediates Clearance of Iron Accumulation by Regulating Iron Metabolism in a Parkinson’s Disease Model Induced by 6-OHDA</a></h4>

<p>The disruption of neuronal iron homeostasis and oxidative stress are related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring enzyme cofactor with antioxidant and iron chelator properties and has many known effects. ALA has neuroprotective effects on PD. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established PD models induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to explore the neuroprotective ability of ALA and its underlying mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that ALA could provide significant protection from 6-OHDA-induced cell damage in vitro by decreasing the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and iron. ALA significantly promoted the survival of the dopaminergic neuron in the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model and remarkably ameliorated motor deficits by dramatically inhibiting the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase expression and superoxide dismutase activity in the substantia nigra. Interestingly, ALA attenuated 6-OHDA-induced iron accumulation both in vivo and in vitro by antagonizing the 6-OHDA-induced upregulation of iron regulatory protein 2 and divalent metal transporter 1. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanism of ALA against neurological injury induced by 6-OHDA may be related to the regulation of iron homeostasis and reduced oxidative stress levels. Therefore, ALA may provide neuroprotective therapy for PD and other diseases related to iron metabolism disorder.</p>

Objective<p>The study aims to investigate the after-effect of three sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on motor cortical excitability. The iTBS was induced over the primary motor cortex (M1) at different time intervals.</p>Methods<p>The study has a crossover design. Sixteen participants were assigned to three groups and received different accelerated iTBS (aiTBS) protocols during each visit: (1) three continuous sessions with no interval (iTBS18000); (2) three iTBS sessions with 10-min intervals (iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>10); and (3) three iTBS sessions with 30-min intervals (iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>30). As washout period, each visit is separated by at least 7 days. We measured the motor cortical excitability changes and intracortical inhibition.</p>Results<p>A dose of 1,800 pulses of aiTBS per day is tolerable. The iTBS1800 led to a reduced cortical excitability; whereas iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>10 and iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>30 enhanced cortical excitability to a differential extent. After a total dose of 1,800 pulses, iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>30 exhibited the longer effect and highest percentage of individuals with enhanced cortical excitability.</p>Conclusion<p>The results suggest that aiTBS protocols at different time intervals result in different motor cortical excitability after-effects.</p>

<p>Objective: To reveal clinical characteristics of suboptimal responses to deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a multi-country DYT1 dystonia cohort.</p><p>Methods: In this multi-country multi-center retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical data of DYT1 patients who experienced suboptimal responses to DBS defined as &lt;30% improvement in dystonia scales at the last follow-up compared with baseline. We used a literature-driven historical cohort of 112 DYT1 patients for comparison.</p><p>Results: Approximately 8% of our study cohort (11 out of 132) experienced suboptimal responses to DBS. Compared with the historical cohort, the multi-country cohort with suboptimal responses had a significantly younger age at onset (mean, 7.0 vs. 8.4 years; p = 0.025) and younger age at DBS (mean, 12.0 vs. 18.6 years; p = 0.019). Additionally, cranial involvement was more common in the multi-country cohort (before DBS, 64% vs. 45%, p = 0.074; before or after DBS, 91% vs. 47%, p = 0.001). Mean motor improvement at the last follow-up from baseline were 0% and 66% for the multi-country and historical cohorts, respectively. All 11 patients of the multi-country cohort had generalization of dystonia within 2.5 years after disease onset. All patients experienced dystonia improvement of &gt;30% postoperatively; however, secondary worsening of dystonia commenced between 6 months and 3 years following DBS. The improvement at the last follow-up was less than 30% despite optimally-placed leads, a trial of multiple programming settings, and additional DBS surgeries in all patients. The on-/off-stimulation comparison at the long-term follow-up demonstrated beneficial effects of DBS despite missing the threshold of 30% improvement over baseline.</p><p>Conclusion: Approximately 8% of patients represent a more aggressive phenotype of DYT1 dystonia characterized by younger age at onset, faster disease progression, and cranial involvement, which seems to be associated with long-term suboptimal responses to DBS (e.g., secondary worsening). This information could be useful for both clinicians and patients in clinical decision making and patient counseling before and following DBS implantations. Patients with this phenotype may have different neuroplasticity, neurogenetics, or possibly distinct neurophysiology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00240">Different Effects of 2 mA and 4 mA Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Muscle Activity and Torque in a Maximal Isokinetic Fatigue Task</a></h4>

<p>Studies investigating the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on fatigue and muscle activity have elicited measurable improvements using stimulation intensities ≤2 mA and submaximal effort tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 2 mA and 4 mA anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on performance fatigability and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the leg muscles during a maximal isokinetic task in healthy young adults. A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study design was applied. Twenty-seven active young adults completed four sessions, each spaced by 5–8 days. During session 1, dominance was verified with isokinetic strength testing, and subjects were familiarized with the fatigue task (FT). The FT protocol included 40 continuous maximum isokinetic contractions of the knee extensors and flexors (120°/s, concentric/concentric). During Sessions 2–4, tDCS was applied for 20 min with one of three randomly assigned intensities (sham, 2 mA or 4 mA) and the FT was repeated. The anode and cathode of the tDCS device were placed over C3 and the contralateral supraorbital area, respectively. A wireless EMG system collected muscle activity during the FT. The 2 mA tDCS condition had significantly less torque (65.9 ± 32.7 Nm) during the FT than both the sham (68.4 ± 33.9 Nm, p &lt; 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (68.4 ± 33.9 Nm, p = 0.001). Furthermore, the 2 mA condition (33.8 ± 11.7%) had significantly less EMG activity during the FT than both the sham (39.7 ± 10.6%, p &lt; 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (40.5 ± 13.4%, p = 0.001). Contrary to previous submaximal isometric fatigue investigations, the 2 mA tDCS condition significantly reduced torque production and EMG activity of the leg extensors during a maximal isokinetic FT compared with the sham and 4 mA conditions. Also, torque production and EMG activity in the 4 mA condition were not significantly different from sham. Thus, the effects of tDCS, and the underlying mechanisms, might not be the same for different tasks and warrants more investigation.</p>

<p>Past empirical studies have suggested that older adults preferentially use gaze-based mood regulation to lessen their negative experiences while watching an emotional scene. This preference for a low cognitively demanding regulatory strategy leaves open the question of whether the effortful processing of a more cognitively demanding reappraisal task is really spared from the general age-related decline. Because it does not allow perceptual attention to be redirected away from the emotional source, music provides an ideal way to address this question. The goal of our study was to examine the affective, behavioral, physiological, and cognitive outcomes of positive and detached reappraisal in response to negative musical emotion in younger and older adults. Participants first simply listened to a series of threatening musical excerpts and were then instructed to either positively reappraise or to detach themselves from the emotion elicited by music. Findings showed that, when instructed to simply listen to threatening music, older adults reported a more positive feeling associated with a smaller SCL in comparison with their younger counterparts. When implementing positive and detached reappraisal, participants showed more positive and more aroused emotional experiences, whatever the age group. We also found that the instruction to intentionally reappraise negative emotions results in a lesser cognitive cost for older adults in comparison with younger adults. Taken together, these data suggest that, compared to younger adults, older adults engage in spontaneous downregulation of negative affect and successfully implement downregulation instructions. This extends previous findings and brings compelling evidence that, even when auditory attention cannot be redirected away from the emotional source, older adults are still more effective at regulating emotions. Taking into account the age-associated decline in executive functioning, our results suggest that the working memory task could have distracted older adults from the reminiscences of the threat-evoking music, thus resulting in an emotional downregulation. Hence, even if they were instructed to implement reappraisal strategies, older adults might prefer distraction over engagement in reappraisal. This is congruent with the idea that, although getting older, people are more likely to be distracted from a negative source of emotion to maintain their well-being.</p>

<p>Neural synchronization patterns are involved in several complex cognitive functions and constitute a growing trend in neuroscience research. While synchrony patterns in working memory have been extensively discussed, a complete understanding of their role in cognitive control and inhibition is still elusive. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on synchronization patterns underlying behavioral inhibition, extrapolating common grounds, and dissociating features with other inhibitory functions. Moreover, we suggest a schematic conceptual framework and highlight existing gaps in the literature, current methodological challenges, and compelling research questions for future studies.</p>

<p>Although physical exercise has been demonstrated to augment recovery of the post-stroke brain, the question of what level of exercise intensity optimizes neurological outcomes of post-stroke rehabilitation remains unsettled. In this study, we aim to clarify the mechanisms underlying the intensity-dependent effect of exercise on neurologic function, and thereby to help direct the clinical application of exercise-based neurorehabilitation. To do this, we used a well-established rat model of ischemic stroke consisting of cerebral ischemia induction through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Ischemic rats were subsequently assigned either to a control group entailing post-stroke rest or to one of two exercise groups distinguished by the intensity of their accompanying treadmill regimens. After 24 h of reperfusion, exercise was initiated. Infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neurological defects were quantified in all groups at 3 days, and motor and cognitive functions were tracked up to day-28. Additionally, Western blotting was used to assess the influence of our interventions on several proteins related to synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity (growth-associated protein 43, a microtubule-associated protein, postsynaptic density-95, synapsin I, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, tyrosine kinase B, and cAMP response element-binding protein). Our results were in equal parts encouraging and surprising. Both mild and intense exercise significantly decreased infarct volume, cell death, and neurological deficits. Motor and cognitive function, as determined using an array of tests such as beam balance, forelimb placing, and the Morris water maze, were also significantly improved by both exercise protocols. Interestingly, while an obvious enhancement of neuroplasticity proteins was shown in both exercise groups, mild exercise rats demonstrated a stronger effect on the expressions of Tau (p &lt; 0.01), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (p &lt; 0.01), and tyrosine kinase B (p &lt; 0.05). These findings contribute to the growing body of literature regarding the positive effects of both mild and intense long-term treadmill exercise on brain injury, functional outcome, and neuroplasticity. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of HIF-1α on the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>Photoreceptor cell death and inflammation are known to occur progressively in retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological processes are largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are essential mediators of cell-to-cell communication with emerging roles in the modulation of immune responses. EVs, including exosomes, encapsulate and transfer microRNA (miRNA) to recipient cells and in this way can modulate the environment of recipient cells. Dysregulation of EVs however is correlated to a loss of cellular homeostasis and increased inflammation. In this work we investigated the role of isolated retinal small-medium sized EV (s-mEV) which includes exosomes in both the healthy and degenerating retina. Isolated s-mEV from normal retinas were characterized using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting, and quantified across 5 days of photo-oxidative damage-induced degeneration using nanotracking analysis. Small RNAseq was used to characterize the miRNA cargo of retinal s-mEV isolated from healthy and damaged retinas. Finally, the effect of exosome inhibition on cell-to-cell miRNA transfer and immune modulation was conducted using systemic daily administration of exosome inhibitor GW4869 and in situ hybridization of s-mEV-abundant miRNA, miR-124-3p. Electroretinography and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess functional and morphological changes to the retina as a result of GW4869-induced exosome depletion. Results demonstrated an inverse correlation between s-mEV concentration and photoreceptor survivability, with a decrease in s-mEV numbers following degeneration. Small RNAseq revealed that s-mEVs contained uniquely enriched miRNAs in comparison to in whole retinal tissue, however, there was no differential change in the s-mEV miRNAnome following photo-oxidative damage. Exosome inhibition via the use of GW4869 was also found to exacerbate retinal degeneration, with reduced retinal function and increased levels of inflammation and cell death demonstrated following photo-oxidative damage in exosome-inhibited mice. Further, GW4869-treated mice displayed impaired translocation of photoreceptor-derived miR-124-3p to the inner retina during damage. Taken together, we propose that retinal s-mEV and their miRNA cargo play an essential role in maintaining retinal homeostasis through immune-modulation, and have the potential to be used in targeted gene therapy for retinal degenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein are central to Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for these events are not fully understood. Post-translational modifications of α-synuclein regulate several of its properties, including degradation, interaction with proteins and membranes, aggregation and toxicity. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involved in various nuclear and extranuclear processes, such as subcellular protein targeting, mitochondrial fission and synaptic plasticity. Protein SUMOylation increases in response to several stressful situations, from viral infections to trauma. In this framework, an increasing amount of evidence has implicated SUMOylation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. This review will discuss recent findings in the role of SUMOylation as a regulator of α-synuclein accumulation, aggregation and toxicity, and its possible implication in neurodegeneration that underlies PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57492">Alternative polyadenylation mediates genetic regulation of gene expression</a></h4>

Little is known about co-transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms linking noncoding variation to variation in organismal traits. To begin addressing this gap, we used 3' Seq to study the impact of genetic variation on alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the nuclear and total mRNA fractions of 52 HapMap Yoruba human lymphoblastoid cell lines. We mapped 602 APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 152 were nuclear specific. Effect sizes at intronic apaQTLs are negatively correlated with eQTL effect sizes. These observations suggest genetic variants can decrease mRNA expression levels by increasing usage of intronic PAS. We also identified 24 apaQTLs associated with protein levels, but not mRNA expression. Finally, we found that 19% of apaQTLs can be associated with disease. Thus, our work demonstrates that APA links genetic variation to variation in gene expression, protein expression, and disease risk, and reveals uncharted modes of genetic regulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56935">Specific labeling of synaptic schwann cells reveals unique cellular and molecular features</a></h4>

Perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) are specialized, non-myelinating, synaptic glia of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), that participate in synapse development, function, maintenance, and repair. The study of PSCs has relied on an anatomy-based approach, as the identities of cell-specific PSC molecular markers have remained elusive. This limited approach has precluded our ability to isolate and genetically manipulate PSCs in a cell specific manner. We have identified neuron-glia antigen 2 (NG2) as a unique molecular marker of S100β+ PSCs in skeletal muscle. NG2 is expressed in Schwann cells already associated with the NMJ, indicating that it is a marker of differentiated PSCs. Using a newly generated transgenic mouse in which PSCs are specifically labeled, we show that PSCs have a unique molecular signature that includes genes known to play critical roles in PSCs and synapses. These findings will serve as a springboard for revealing drivers of PSC differentiation and function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56844">A microscopy-based kinetic analysis of yeast vacuolar protein sorting</a></h4>

<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is amenable to studying membrane traffic by live-cell fluorescence microscopy. We used this system to explore two aspects of cargo protein traffic through prevacuolar endosome (PVE) compartments to the vacuole. First, at what point during Golgi maturation does a biosynthetic vacuolar cargo depart from the maturing cisternae? To address this question, we modified a regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo by adding a vacuolar targeting signal. Traffic of the vacuolar cargo requires the GGA clathrin adaptors, which arrive during the early-to-late Golgi transition. Accordingly, the vacuolar cargo begins to exit the Golgi near the midpoint of maturation, significantly before exit of a secretory cargo. Second, how are cargoes delivered from PVE compartments to the vacuole? To address this question, we tracked biosynthetic and endocytic cargoes after they had accumulated in PVE compartments. The results suggest that stable PVE compartments repeatedly deliver material to the vacuole by a kiss-and-run mechanism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54978">Controlling motor neurons of every muscle for fly proboscis reaching</a></h4>

We describe the anatomy of all the primary motor neurons in the fly proboscis and characterize their contributions to its diverse reaching movements. Pairing this behavior with the wealth of <i>Drosophila’s</i> genetic tools offers the possibility to study motor control at single-neuron resolution, and soon throughout entire circuits. As an entry to these circuits, we provide detailed anatomy of proboscis motor neurons, muscles, and joints. We create a collection of fly strains to individually manipulate every proboscis muscle through control of its motor neurons, the first such collection for an appendage. We generate a model of the action of each proboscis joint, and find that only a small number of motor neurons are needed to produce proboscis reaching. Comprehensive control of each motor element in this numerically simple system paves the way for future study of both reflexive and flexible movements of this appendage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54662">Numerical magnitude, rather than individual bias, explains spatial numerical association in newborn chicks</a></h4>

We associate small numbers with the left and large numbers with the right side of space. Recent evidence from human newborns and non-human animals has challenged the primary role assigned to culture, in determining this spatial numerical association (SNA). Nevertheless, the effect of individual spatial biases has not been considered in previous research. Here, we tested the effect of numerical magnitude in SNA and we controlled for itablendividual biases. We trained 3-day-old chicks (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) on a given numerical magnitude (5). Then chicks could choose between two identical, left or right, stimuli both representing either 2, 8, or 5 elements. We computed the percentage of Left-sided Choice (LC). Numerical magnitude, but not individual lateral bias, explained LC: LC2 <i>vs</i>. 2&gt;LC5 <i>vs</i>. 5&gt;LC8 <i>vs</i>. 8. These findings suggest that SNA originates from pre-linguistic precursors, and pave the way to the investigation of the neural correlates of the number space association.

Monitoring outcome is critical for acquiring skilled movements. Levy et al. describe activity in subpopulations of layer 2–3 motor cortex pyramidal neurons that distinctly report outcomes of previous successes and failures independent of kinematics and reward. These signals may serve as reinforcement learning processes involved in maintaining or learning skilled movements.

<p>by Seha Kim, Johannes Burge</p>

Visual systems estimate the three-dimensional (3D) structure of scenes from information in two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. Visual systems use multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including statistical knowledge of the probable spatial arrangements of natural scenes. Here, we examine how 3D surface tilts are spatially related in real-world scenes, and show that humans pool information across space when estimating surface tilt in accordance with these spatial relationships. We develop a hierarchical model of surface tilt estimation that is grounded in the statistics of tilt in natural scenes and images. The model computes a global tilt estimate by pooling local tilt estimates within an adaptive spatial neighborhood. The spatial neighborhood in which local estimates are pooled changes according to the value of the local estimate at a target location. The hierarchical model provides more accurate estimates of groundtruth tilt in natural scenes and provides a better account of human performance than the local model. Taken together, the results imply that the human visual system pools information about surface tilt across space in accordance with natural scene statistics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvVMYJ-9G20" width="1" />

<p>by Emili Balaguer-Ballester, Ramon Nogueira, Juan M. Abofalia, Ruben Moreno-Bote, Maria V. Sanchez-Vives</p>

Shared neuronal variability has been shown to modulate cognitive processing. However, the relationship between shared variability and behavioral performance is heterogeneous and complex in frontal areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Mounting evidence shows that single-units in OFC encode a detailed cognitive map of task-space events, but the existence of a robust neuronal ensemble coding for the predictability of choice outcome is less established. Here, we hypothesize that the coding of foreseeable outcomes is potentially unclear from the analysis of units activity and their pairwise correlations. However, this code might be established more conclusively when higher-order neuronal interactions are mapped to the choice outcome. As a case study, we investigated the trial-to-trial shared variability of neuronal ensemble activity during a two-choice interval-discrimination task in rodent OFC, specifically designed such that a lose-switch strategy is optimal by repeating the rewarded stimulus in the upcoming trial. Results show that correlations among triplets are higher during correct choices with respect to incorrect ones, and that this is sustained during the entire trial. This effect is not observed for pairwise nor for higher than third-order correlations. This scenario is compatible with constellations of up to three interacting units assembled during trials in which the task is performed correctly. More interestingly, a state-space spanned by such constellations shows that only correct outcome states that can be successfully predicted are robust over 100 trials of the task, and thus they can be accurately decoded. However, both incorrect and unpredictable outcome representations were unstable and thus non-decodeable, due to spurious negative correlations. Our results suggest that predictability of successful outcomes, and hence the optimal behavioral strategy, can be mapped out in OFC ensemble states reliable over trials of the task, and revealed by sufficiency complex neuronal interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PGyrJ6PKf94" width="1" />

During embryogenesis, morphogens form a concentration gradient in responsive tissue, which is then translated into a spatial cellular pattern. The mechanisms by which morphogens spread through a tissue to establish such a morphogenetic field remain elusive. Here, we investigate by mutually complementary simulations and <i>in vivo</i> experiments how Wnt morphogen transport by cytonemes differs from typically assumed diffusion-based transport for patterning of highly dynamic tissue such as the neural plate in zebrafish. Stochasticity strongly influences fate acquisition at the single cell level and results in fluctuating boundaries between pattern regions. Stable patterning can be achieved by sorting through concentration dependent cell migration and apoptosis, independent of the morphogen transport mechanism. We show that Wnt transport by cytonemes achieves distinct Wnt thresholds for the brain primordia earlier compared with diffusion-based transport. We conclude that a cytoneme-mediated morphogen transport together with directed cell sorting is a potentially favored mechanism to establish morphogen gradients in rapidly expanding developmental systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lDRf_GSbN80" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tanycytes are highly specialized ependymal cells that line the bottom and the lateral walls of the third ventricle. In contact with the cerebrospinal fluid through their cell bodies, they send processes into the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus, and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the present work, we combined transgenic and immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical associations between tanycytes and neural cells present in the hypothalamic parenchyma, in particular in the arcuate nucleus. The specific expression of tdTomato in tanycytes first allowed the observation of peculiar subcellular protrusions along tanycyte processes and at their endfeet such as spines, swelling, en passant boutons, boutons, or claws. Interestingly, these protrusions contact different neural cells in the brain parenchyma including blood vessels and neurons, and in particular NPY and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Using both fluorescent and electron microscopy, we finally observed that these tanycyte protrusions contain ribosomes, mitochondria, diverse vesicles, and transporters, suggesting dense tanycyte/neuron and tanycyte/blood vessel communications. Altogether, our results lay the neuroanatomical basis for tanycyte/neural cell interactions, which will be useful to further understand cell‐to‐cell communications involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>An in‐depth understanding of the genetics and evolution of brain function and behavior requires a detailed mapping of gene expression in functional brain circuits across major vertebrate clades. Here we present the <b>Z </b>ebra finch <b>E </b>xpression <b>Br </b>ain <b>A </b>tlas (<b>ZEBrA </b>; <a href="http://www.zebrafinchatlas.org" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">www.zebrafinchatlas.org</a>, RRID: SCR_012988), a web‐based resource that maps the expression of genes linked to a broad range of functions onto the brain of zebra finches. ZEBrA is a first of its kind gene expression brain atlas for a bird species and a first for any sauropsid. ZEBrA's &gt;3,200 high‐resolution digital images of <i>in situ </i> hybridized sections for ~650 genes (as of June 2019) are presented in alignment with an annotated histological atlas and can be browsed down to cellular resolution. An extensive relational database connects expression patterns to information about gene function, mouse expression patterns and phenotypes, and gene involvement in human diseases and communication disorders. By enabling brain‐wide gene expression assessments in a bird, ZEBrA provides important substrates for comparative neuroanatomy and molecular brain evolution studies. ZEBrA also provides unique opportunities for linking genetic pathways to vocal learning and motor control circuits, as well as for novel insights into the molecular basis of sex steroids actions, brain dimorphisms, reproductive and social behaviors, sleep function, and adult neurogenesis, among many fundamental themes.</p>

<p>Using a high‐resolution data set of electron microscopy images of a fruit fly brain, we traced the axons of two major subgroups of auditory sensory neurons, Johnston's organ (JO)‐A and JO‐B, and major downstream neurons, antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC)‐B1 and giant fiber (GF), in the song‐relay and escape pathways, respectively. JO‐A and JO‐B neurons have abundant presynapses and postsynapses along their axons. Specific types of JO‐A and JO‐B neurons feed into the AMMC‐B1 and/or GF pathways.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many animals rely on acoustic cues to decide what action to take next. Unraveling the wiring patterns of the auditory neural pathways is prerequisite for understanding such information processing. Here, we reconstructed the first step of the auditory neural pathway in the fruit fly brain, from primary to secondary auditory neurons, at the resolution of transmission electron microscopy. By tracing axons of two major subgroups of auditory sensory neurons in fruit flies, low‐frequency tuned Johnston's organ (JO)‐B neurons and high‐frequency tuned JO‐A neurons, we observed extensive connections from JO‐B neurons to the main second‐order neurons in both the song‐relay and escape pathways. In contrast, JO‐A neurons connected strongly to a neuron in the escape pathway. Our findings suggest that heterogeneous JO neuronal populations could be recruited to modify escape behavior whereas only specific JO neurons contribute to courtship behavior. We also found that all JO neurons have postsynaptic sites at their axons. Presynaptic modulation at the output sites of JO neurons could affect information processing of the auditory neural pathway in flies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Melanopsin ganglion cells have defied convention since their discovery almost 20 years ago. In the years following, many types of these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) have emerged. In the mouse retina, there are currently six known types (M1–M6) of melanopsin ganglion cells, each with unique morphology, mosaics, connections, physiology, projections, and functions. While melanopsin‐expressing cells are usually associated with behaviors like circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex, the characterization of multiple types has demonstrated a reach that may extend far beyond non‐image‐forming vision. In fact, studies have shown that individual types of melanopsin ganglion cells have the potential to impact image‐forming functions like contrast sensitivity and color opponency. Thus, the goal of this review is to summarize the morphological and functional aspects of the six known types of melanopsin ganglion cells in the mouse retina and to highlight their respective roles in non‐image‐forming and image‐forming vision. Although many melanopsin ganglion cell types do project to image‐forming brain targets, it is important to note that this is only the first step in determining their influence on image‐forming vision. Even so, the visual system has canonically been divided into these two functional realms and melanopsin ganglion cells have begun to challenge the boundary between them, providing an overlap of visual information that is complementary rather than redundant. Further studies on these ganglion cell photoreceptors will no doubt continue to illustrate an ever‐expanding role for melanopsin ganglion cells in image‐forming vision.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Connections from intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), to ascending motor and interneurons have been described in guinea pig colon. These mono‐ and polysynaptic circuits may underlie polarized motor reflexes evoked by local gut stimulation. There is a need to translate findings in guinea pig to mouse, a species increasingly used in enteric neuroscience. Here, mouse distal colon was immunolabeled for CGRP, a marker of putative IPANs. This revealed a combination of large, intensely immunofluorescent axons in myenteric plexus and circular muscle, and thinner varicose axons with less immunofluorescence. The latter formed dense, basket‐like varicosity clusters (CGRP+ baskets) that enveloped myenteric nerve cell bodies. Immunolabeling after 4–5 days in organ culture caused loss of large CGRP+ axons, but not varicose CGRP+ fibers and CGRP+ baskets. Baskets were characterized further by triple labeling with CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and calretinin (CALR) antibodies. Approximately half (48%) of nerve cell bodies inside CGRP+ baskets lacked both NOS and CALR, while two overlapping populations containing NOS and/or CALR comprised the remainder. Quantitative analysis revealed CGRP+ varicosities were most abundant in baskets, followed by CALR+ varicosities, with a high degree of colocalization between the two markers. Few NOS+ varicosities occurred in baskets. Significantly higher proportions of CALR+ and CGRP+ varicosities colocalized in baskets than in circular muscle. In conclusion, CGRP+ baskets in mouse colon are formed by intrinsic enteric neurons with a neurochemical profile consistent with IPANs and have direct connections to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p>

<p>In the study, we identified two subsets of Lyve‐1 positive cells in the cervical dura of rats. The first subset was lymphatic VEGFR3 positive endothelial cells, while the second subset were nonlymphatic VEGFR3 negative, but CD68 or CD169 positive macrophage. Interestingly, there were no dual VEGFR3‐Lyve‐1 positive cells in the spinal dura, but were CD169 positive macrophages. The endothelial Lyve‐1 positive cells were aligned with collagen fibers in the meningeal connective tissue. Moreover, some of the Lyve‐1 positive macrophages contained intracellular collagen. The role of these Lyve‐1 positive macrophages in meninges is yet unknown.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Meningeal immunity along with its associated lymphatic vasculatures is widely discussed recently. Lymphatic vessels in meninges drain interstitial fluid into the deep‐cervical lymph nodes. The vessels are composed of cells that express the cardinal marker for lymphatic endothelium—the lymphatic vessel hyaluronan receptor‐1 (Lyve‐1). However, studies also show the presence of nonendothelial Lyve‐1 expressing cells in certain tissues. Therefore, we were curious if nonendothelial Lyve‐1+ cells are also present in dura mater of meninges. We show that Lyve‐1+ endothelial cells are distributed adjacent to the blood vessels in the brain dura mater of rats. We did not observe any lymphatic vessels in spinal dura mater. Interestingly, we also observed isolated population of nonlymphatic Lyve‐1+ cells in both brain and spinal dura mater. Morphologically, the Lyve‐1+ cells were extensively pleomorphic, sometimes elongated or round. Surprisingly, the thoracolumbal meningeal Lyve‐1+ cells were predominantly round in morphology. Using endothelial specific marker VEGFR3 and macrophage markers CD68 and CD169, we observed that the isolated Lyve‐1+ cells lacked endothelial cell signature, but were either CD68+ or CD169+ macrophages. Moreover, we observed that the Lyve‐1+ cells colocalized with collagen fibers in the meninges, and some of Lyve‐1+ cells had intracellular collagen. The study for the first time demonstrates the presence of Lyve‐1 positive macrophages in the lymphatic and nonlymphatic regions in the meninges of rats.</p>

<p>ATP‐activated P2X7 (P2RX7) and adenosine receptors are involved in the progression of the majority of retinopathies leading to blindness. Purinergic signaling regulates progenitor proliferative activity in regeneration, growth, and development as well as proliferative retinopathies. We found that BzATP—a potent agonist of P2RX7—<i>in vivo </i> treatment provoked photoreceptor death and regeneration via multipotent progenitor mitotic activation. Furthermore, extracellular ATP via P2RX7 and adenosine via A<sub>2A</sub>R are key signals regulating retina regeneration with neuroprotective activity following photoreceptor injury.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Injured retinas in mammals do not regenerate and heal with loss of function. The adult retina of zebrafish self‐repairs after damage by activating cell‐intrinsic mechanisms, which are regulated by extrinsic signal interactions. Among relevant regulatory extrinsic systems, purinergic signaling regulates progenitor proliferation during retinogenesis and regeneration and glia proliferation in proliferative retinopathies. ATP‐activated P2X7 (P2RX7) and adenosine (P1R) receptors are involved in the progression of almost all retinopathies leading to blindness. Here, we examined P2RX7 and P1R participation in the retina regenerative response induced by photoreceptor damage caused by a specific dose of CoCl<sub>2</sub>. First, we found that treatment of uninjured retinas with a potent agonist of P2RX7 (BzATP) provoked photoreceptor damage and mitotic activation of multipotent progenitors. In CoCl<sub>2</sub>‐injured retinas, blockade of endogenous extracellular ATP activity on P2RX7 caused further neurodegeneration, Müller cell gliosis, progenitor proliferation, and microglia reactivity. P2RX7 inhibition in injured retinas also increased the expression of <i>lin28a </i> and <i>tnfα </i> genes, which are related to multipotent progenitor proliferation. Levels of <i>hif1α </i>, <i>vegf3r </i>, and <i>vegfaa </i> mRNA were enhanced by blockade of P2RX7 immediately after injury, indicating hypoxic like damage and endothelial cell growth and proliferation. Complete depletion of extracellular nucleotides with an apyrase treatment strongly potentiated cell death and progenitor proliferation induced with CoCl<sub>2</sub>. Blockade of adenosine P1 and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R) had deleterious effects and deregulated normal timing for progenitor and precursor cell proliferation following photoreceptor damage. ATP via P2RX7 and adenosine via A<sub>2A</sub>R are survival extracellular signals key for retina regeneration in zebrafish.</p>

<p>Representative fluorescence in situ hybridization micrographs revealing the expression of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) mRNA in adult mouse brain. Generally speaking, CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA is widely expressed in the whole brain with sexually dimorphic distribution in the orbital cortex, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, piriform cortex, visual cortex, striatum, ventral hippocampal CA1, fornix, and dorsal hypothalamic area.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) is the most abundant G protein‐coupled receptor in the brain and plays crucial roles in emotion and behavior by modulating or mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity. Differences in CB<sub>1</sub>R density between male and female rodents may be associated with distinct behavioral phenotypes. In the rat brain, CB<sub>1</sub>R expression is significantly lower in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of estrus females than in males. However, differences in CB<sub>1</sub>R distribution due to sex over the whole mouse brain are still largely unknown. Here, we systemically investigated the expression of CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the brains of both male and female adult C57BL/6J mice using fluorescence in situ hybridization. There were significantly more CB<sub>1</sub>R positive cells in males than in females in the orbital cortex, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, piriform cortex, secondary visual cortex, caudate putamen (striatum), and ventral hippocampal CA1. There were significantly more CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA cells in females than males in the fornix and dorsal hypothalamus. However, in some regions, strong hybridization signals without sex differences were detected, such as in the motor cortex, septum, medial habenular nucleus, and inferior colliculus. Moreover, female mice displayed different CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA expression patterns in the medial amygdala, basolateral amygdala, and parabrachial nucleus during different phases of the estrous cycle. These findings provide a basis for understanding sexual dimorphism in physiological and pathological brain functions related to CB<sub>1</sub>R.</p>

<p>During the first postnatal week of development in the mouse cochlea, Pou3f4 is expressed by mesenchyme cells surrounding the auditory spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In the absence of <i>Pou3f4 </i>, approximately 25% of SGNs are lost within this same timeframe.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During inner ear development, primary auditory neurons named spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are surrounded by otic mesenchyme cells, which express the transcription factor Pou3f4. Mutations in <i>Pou3f4 </i> are associated with DFNX2, the most common form of X‐linked deafness and typically include developmental malformations of the middle ear and inner ear. It is known that interactions between Pou3f4‐expressing mesenchyme cells and SGNs are important for proper axon bundling during development. However, Pou3f4 continues to be expressed through later phases of development, and potential interactions between Pou3f4 and SGNs during this period had not been explored. To address this, we documented Pou3f4 protein expression in the early postnatal mouse cochlea and compared SGNs in <i>Pou3f4 </i> knockout mice and littermate controls. In <i>Pou3f4 </i>
<sup>y/−</sup> mice, SGN density begins to decline by the end of the first postnatal week, with approximately 25% of SGNs ultimately lost. This period of SGN loss in <i>Pou3f4 </i>
<sup>y/−</sup> cochleae coincides with significant elevations in SGN apoptosis. Interestingly, this period also coincides with the presence of a transient population of Pou3f4‐expressing cells around and within the spiral ganglion. To determine if Pou3f4 is normally required for SGN peripheral axon extension into the sensory domain, we used a genetic sparse labeling approach to track SGNs and found no differences compared with controls. We also found that <i>Pou3f4 </i> loss did not lead to changes in the proportions of Type I SGN subtypes. Overall, these data suggest that otic mesenchyme cells may play a role in maintaining SGN populations during the early postnatal period.</p>

<p>Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a common 4R-tauopathy, causing or contributing to cognitive impairment in the elderly. AGD is characterized neuropathologically by pre-tangles in neurons, dendritic swellings called grains, threads, thorn-shaped astrocytes, and coiled bodies in oligodendrocytes in the limbic system. AGD has a characteristic pattern progressively involving the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, presubiculum, subiculum, hypothalamic nuclei, temporal cortex, and neocortex and brainstem, thus suggesting that argyrophilic grain pathology is a natural model of tau propagation. One series of WT mice was unilaterally inoculated in the hippocampus with sarkosyl-insoluble and sarkosyl-soluble fractions from “pure” AGD at the age of 3 or 7/12 months and killed 3 or 7 months later. Abnormal hyper-phosphorylated tau deposits were found in ipsilateral hippocampal neurons, grains (dots) in the hippocampus, and threads, dots and coiled bodies in the fimbria, as well as the ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum. The extension of lesions was wider in animals surviving 7 months compared with those surviving 3 months. Astrocytic inclusions were not observed at any time. Tau deposits were mainly composed of 4Rtau, but also 3Rtau. For comparative purposes, another series of WT mice was inoculated with sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a pure neuronal neurofibrillary tangle 3Rtau + 4Rtau tauopathy involving the deep temporal cortex and limbic system. Abnormal hyper-phosphorylated tau deposits were found in neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus, coiled bodies and threads in the fimbria, and the ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum, which extended with time along the anterior-posterior axis and distant regions such as hypothalamic nuclei and nuclei of the septum when comparing mice surviving 7 months with mice surviving 3 months. Astrocytic inclusions were not observed. Tau deposits were mainly composed of 4Rtau and 3Rtau. These results show the capacity for seeding and spreading of AGD tau and PART tau in the brain of WT mouse, and suggest that characteristics of host tau, in addition to those of inoculated tau, are key to identifying commonalities and differences between human tauopathies and corresponding murine models.</p>

<p>Elevated pulse pressure can cause blood-brain barrier dysfunction and subsequent adverse neurological changes that may drive or contribute to the development of dementia with age. In short, elevated pulse pressure dysregulates cerebral endothelial cells and increases cellular production of oxidative and inflammatory molecules. The resulting cerebral microvascular damage, along with excessive pulsatile mechanical force, can induce breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which in turn triggers brain cell impairment and death. We speculate that elevated pulse pressure may also reduce the efficacy of other therapeutic strategies for dementia. For instance, BACE1 inhibitors and anti-amyloid-β biologics reduce amyloid-β deposits in the brain that are thought to be a cause of Alzheimer’s disease, the most prevalent form of dementia. However, upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory molecules and increased amyloid-β secretion by cerebral endothelial cells exposed to elevated pulse pressure may hinder cognitive improvements with these drugs. Additionally, stem or progenitor cell therapy has the potential to repair blood-brain barrier damage, but chronic oxidative and inflammatory stress due to elevated pulse pressure can inhibit stem and progenitor cell regeneration. Finally, we discuss current efforts to repurpose blood pressure medications to prevent or treat dementia. We propose that new drugs or devices should be developed to safely reduce elevated pulse pressure specifically to the brain. Such novel technologies may alleviate an entire downstream pathway of cellular dysfunction, oxidation, inflammation, and amyloidogenesis, thereby preventing pulse-pressure-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, these technologies may also enhance efficacy of other dementia therapeutics when used in combination.</p>

<p>Brain-on-chip (BOC) technology such as nanogrooves and microtunnel structures can advance in vitro neuronal models by providing a platform with better means to maintain, manipulate and analyze neuronal cell cultures. Specifically, nanogrooves have been shown to influence neuronal differentiation, notably the neurite length and neurite direction. Here, we have drawn new results from our experiments using both 2D and 3D neuronal cell culture implementing both flat and nanogrooved substrates. These are used to show a comparison between the number of cells and neurite length as a first indicator for valuable insights into baseline values and expectations that can be generated from these experiments toward design optimization and predictive value of the technology in our BOC toolbox. Also, as a new step toward neuronal cell models with multiple compartmentalized neuronal cell type regions, we fabricated microtunnel devices bonded to both flat and nanogrooved substrates to assess their compatibility with neuronal cell culture. Our results show that with the current experimental protocols using SH-SY5Y cells, we can expect 200 – 400 cells with a total neurite length of approximately 4,000–5,000 μm per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> within our BOC devices, with a lower total neurite length for 3D neuronal cell cultures on flat substrates only. There is a statistically significant difference in total neurite length between 2D cell culture on nanogrooved substrates versus 3D cell culture on flat substrates. As extension of our current BOC toolbox for which these indicative parameters would be used, the microtunnel devices show that culture of SH-SY5Y was feasible, though a limited number of neurites extended into microtunnels away from the cell bodies, regardless of using nanogrooved or flat substrates. This shows that the novel combination of microtunnel devices with nanogrooves can be implemented toward neuronal cell cultures, with future improvements to be performed to ensure neurites extend beyond the confines of the wells between the microtunnels. Overall, these results will aid toward creating more robust BOC platforms with improved predictive value. In turn, this can be used to better understand the brain and brain diseases.</p>

<p>In this study, we investigated the effect of the dynamic changes in brain activation during neurofeedback training in the classification of the different brain states associated with the target tasks. We hypothesized that ongoing activation patterns could change during neurofeedback session due to learning effects and, in the process, could affect the performance of brain state classifiers trained using data obtained prior to the session. Using a motor imagery paradigm, we then examined the application of an incremental training approach where classifiers were continuously updated in order to account for these activation changes. Our results confirmed our hypothesis that neurofeedback training could be associated with dynamic changes in brain activation characterized by an initially more widespread brain activation followed by a more focused and localized activation pattern. By continuously updating the trained classifiers after each feedback run, significant improvement in accurately classifying the different brain states associated with the target motor imagery tasks was achieved. These findings suggest the importance of taking into account brain activation changes during neurofeedback in order to provide more reliable and accurate feedback information to the participants, which is critical for an effective neurofeedback application.</p>

<p>Nearly half of all mild brain injury sufferers experience long-term cognitive impairment, so an important goal in rehabilitation is to address their multiple cognitive deficits to help them return to prior levels of functioning. Cognitive training, or the use of repeated mental exercises to enhance cognition, is one remediation method for brain injury. The primary purpose of this hypothesis-generating pilot study was to explore the statistical and clinical significance of cognitive changes and transfer of training to real-life functioning following 60 h of Brain Booster, a clinician-delivered cognitive training program, for six patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) or non-traumatic acquired brain injury (ABI). The secondary purpose was to explore changes in functional connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive test gains following the training. We used a multiple case study design to document significant changes in cognitive test scores, overall IQ score, and symptom ratings; and we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore trends in functional network connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive change. All cognitive test scores showed improvement with statistically significant changes on five of the seven measures (long-term memory, processing speed, reasoning, auditory processing, and overall IQ score). The mean change in IQ score was 20 points, from a mean of 108 to a mean of 128. Five themes emerged from the qualitative data analysis including improvements in cognition, mood, social identity, performance, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). With MRI, we documented significant region-to-region changes in connectivity following cognitive training including those involving the cerebellum and cerebellar networks. We also found significant correlations between changes in IQ score and change in white matter integrity of bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the left uncinate fasciculus. This study adds to the growing body of literature examining the effects of cognitive training for mild TBI and ABI, and to the collection of research on the benefits of cognitive training in general.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02918994.</p>

<p>Tension experience is the basis for music emotion. In music, discrete elements are always organized into complex nested structures to convey emotion. However, the processing of music tension in the nested structure remains unknown. The present study investigated the tension experience induced by the nested structure and the underlying neural mechanisms, using a continuous tension rating task and electroencephalography (EEG) at the same time. Thirty musicians listened to music chorale sequences with non-nested, singly nested and doubly nested structures and were required to rate their real-time tension experience. Behavioral data indicated that the tension experience induced by the nested structure had more fluctuations than the non-nested structure, and the difference was mainly exhibited in the process of tension induction rather than tension resolution. However, the EEG data showed that larger late positive components (LPCs) were elicited by the ending chords in the nested structure compared with the non-nested structure, reflecting the difference in cognitive integration for long-distance structural dependence. The discrepancy between resolution experience and neural responses revealed the non-parallel relations between emotion and cognition. Furthermore, the LPC elicited by the doubly nested structure showed a smaller scalp distribution than the singly nested structure, indicating the more difficult processing of the doubly nested structure. These findings revealed the dynamic tension experience induced by the nested structure and the influence of nested type, shedding new light on the relationship between structure and tension in music.</p>

<p>The influence of motivation on selective visual attention in states of high vs. low vigilance is poorly understood. To explore the possible differences in the influence of motivation on behavioral performance and neural activity in high and low vigilance levels, we conducted a prolonged 2 h 20 min flanker task and provided monetary rewards during the 20- to 40- and 100- to 120-min intervals of task performance. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological measures were modulated by prolonged task engagement. Moreover, the effect of reward was different in high vs. low vigilance states. The monetary reward increased accuracy and decreased the reaction time (RT) and number of omitted responses in the low but not in the high vigilance state. The fatigue-related decrease in P300 amplitude recovered to its level in the high vigilance state by manipulating motivation, whereas the fatigue-related increase in P300 latency was not modulated by reward. Additionally, the fatigue-related increase in event-related spectral power at 1–4 Hz was sensitive to vigilance decrement and reward. However, the spectral power at 4–8 Hz was only affected by the decrease in vigilance. These electrophysiological measures were not influenced by motivation in the state of high vigilance. Our results suggest that neural processing capacity, but not the timing of processing, is sensitive to motivation. These findings also imply that the fatigue-related impairments in behavioral performance and neural activity underlying selective visual attention only partly recover after manipulating motivation. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the dissociable neural mechanisms underlying the fatigue-related decrease vs. reward-related increase in attentional resources.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence has consistently shown that team-based sports (such as basketball) are beneficial to interpersonal cooperation. However, its neural correlate remains to be discovered, especially in the perspective of two-person neuroscience. In this study, 12 dyads of basketball players and 12 dyads of college students who had no experience of team-based sports training were asked to perform joint-drawing task and control task. During task performance, neural activities were recorded in frontal area by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning approach. The results demonstrated that dyads of basketball players were faster to finish joint-drawing task and showed higher subjective cooperativeness than dyads of college students. Meanwhile, significant interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) was observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal area only when pairs of basketball players performed joint-drawing task, but not control task. Therefore, we provide the first piece of inter-brain evidence for enhanced cooperative behavior in the individuals with team-based sports training, which could make us deeply understand exact neural correlate for experience-dependent changes of cognitions in humans.</p>

<p>All vertebrate brains contain a dense matrix of thin fibers that release serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), a neurotransmitter that modulates a wide range of neural, glial, and vascular processes. Perturbations in the density of this matrix have been associated with a number of mental disorders, including autism and depression, but its self-organization and plasticity remain poorly understood. We introduce a model based on reflected Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), a rigorously defined stochastic process, and show that it recapitulates some key features of regional serotonergic fiber densities. Specifically, we use supercomputing simulations to model fibers as FBM-paths in two-dimensional brain-like domains and demonstrate that the resultant steady state distributions approximate the fiber distributions in physical brain sections immunostained for the serotonin transporter (a marker for serotonergic axons in the adult brain). We suggest that this framework can support predictive descriptions and manipulations of the serotonergic matrix and that it can be further extended to incorporate the detailed physical properties of the fibers and their environment.</p>

<p>Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by the neuron-specific activators p35/p39 and plays important roles in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive behavior. However, the proteolytic cleavage of p35 to p25 leads to prolonged and aberrant Cdk5 activation and results in synaptic depression, highly mimicking the early pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Therefore, Cdk5 inhibition is a potential promising strategy for AD drug development. Here in the present study, we showed that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 diabetes, suppressed Cdk5 hyper-activation and Cdk5-dependent tau hyper-phosphorylation in the APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus. We also identified the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism that metformin prevented Cdk5 hyper-activation by inhibiting the calpain-dependent cleavage of p35 into p25. Moreover, chronic metformin treatment rescued the core phenotypes in APP/PS1 mice as evidenced by restored spine density, surface GluA1 trafficking, Long-term potentiation (LTP) expression, and spatial memory. Altogether our study discovered an unidentified role of metformin in suppressing Cdk5 hyper-activation and thus preventing AD pathogenesis and suggested that metformin is a potential promising AD therapeutic drug.</p>

Background<p>Long-term combination of physical exercises has reported benefits for cognitive functions and mood states. However, it remains unclear whether a single bout of combination exercise training has acute positive effects on cognitive functions and mood states in middle-aged and older women. It is important to investigate acute effect of physical exercise because it would help to understand a mechanism of benefits of physical exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate 30 min of a single bout of combination exercise training on cognition and mood states in middle-aged and older females.</p>Methods<p>In this single-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), middle-aged and older females were assigned randomly to two groups: a combination exercise group and a no-exercise control group. The former group did the combination exercise training (aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises) for 30 min. Meanwhile, the latter group did not do any exercise and waited for 30 min. We measured cognitive functions and mood performance states before and after the exercise or control interventions.</p>Results<p>Our main results demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the combination exercise improved inhibition (reverse Stroop and Stroop) and increased vigor–activity mood scores in both middle-aged and older groups. We also found that the only combination exercise group showed the significant positive correlations between improved inhibition performance and improved vigor–activity mood.</p>Discussion<p>This randomized controlled trial revealed the acute benefits of combination exercise on inhibition in executive functions and vigor–activity in the healthy middle-aged and older females. Our results provided the scientific evidence related to acute effects of the single bout of the combination exercise training. It suggests that we would be better to do the 30 min physical exercise for our health.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>This trial was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000029681).

<p>Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs). Soluble β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is one of the orthosteric modulators of CaSR, while, the role and underlying mechanism of CaSR in cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is unclear. In this study, molecular technology such as live-cell imaging combined with behavioral tests were used to explore the role and the underlying mechanism of CaSR in the cognitive deficits in AD mice. The expression levels of CaSR were increased both in AD mice and Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> (β-amyloid protein)-treated primary cultured neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of CaSR ameliorated recognitive and spatial memory deficits of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>-oligomer-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of CaSR or down-regulation of the expression of CaSR by CaSR-shRNA-lentivirus prevented the impairment of filopodia, and the synapse induced by oligomeric Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>. The contents of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in hippocampal neurons and tissue were increased after treatment with Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> oligomers. Inhibition or down-regulation of CaSR mediates Aβ-induced synapse formation and cognitive deficits partially, through the activation of the cPLA2/PGE2 pathway. This study provides novel insights on CaSR, which is a promising therapeutic target for AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57907">Nanobody-directed targeting of optogenetic tools to study signaling in the primary cilium</a></h4>

Compartmentalization of cellular signaling forms the molecular basis of cellular behavior. The primary cilium constitutes a subcellular compartment that orchestrates signal transduction independent from the cell body. Ciliary dysfunction causes severe diseases, termed ciliopathies. Analyzing ciliary signaling has been challenging due to the lack of tools investigate ciliary signaling. Here, we describe a nanobody-based targeting approach for optogenetic tools in mammalian cells and <i>in vivo</i> in zebrafish to specifically analyze ciliary signaling and function. Thereby, we overcome the loss of protein function observed after fusion to ciliary targeting sequences. We functionally localized modifiers of cAMP signaling, the photo-activated adenylate cyclase bPAC and the light-activated phosphodiesterase LAPD, and the cAMP biosensor mlCNBD-FRET to the cilium. Using this approach, we studied the contribution of spatial cAMP signaling in controlling cilia length. Combining optogenetics with nanobody-based targeting will pave the way to the molecular understanding of ciliary function in health and disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57640">Echinoderms provide missing link in the evolution of PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling</a></h4>

Neuropeptide signalling systems comprising peptide ligands and cognate receptors are evolutionarily ancient regulators of physiology and behaviour. However, there are challenges associated with determination of orthology between neuropeptides in different taxa. Orthologs of vertebrate neuropeptide-Y (NPY) known as neuropeptide-F (NPF) have been identified in protostome invertebrates, whilst prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) and short neuropeptide-F (sNPF) have been identified as paralogs of NPY/NPF in vertebrates and protostomes, respectively. Here we investigated the occurrence of NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-related signalling systems in a deuterostome invertebrate phylum – the Echinodermata. Analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data revealed loss of NPY/NPF-type signalling, but orthologs of PrRP-type neuropeptides and sNPF/PrRP-type receptors were identified in echinoderms. Furthermore, experimental studies revealed that the PrRP-type neuropeptide pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH<sub>2</sub> is a potent ligand for a sNPF/PrRP-type receptor in the starfish <i>Asterias rubens</i>. Our findings indicate that PrRP-type and sNPF-type signalling systems are orthologous and originated as a paralog of NPY/NPF-type signalling in Urbilateria.

To study the mechanisms by which the p.R47H variant of the microglia gene and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factor TREM2 increases dementia risk, we created<i> Trem2<sup>R47H</sup></i> KI rats. <i>Trem2<sup>R47H</sup></i> rats were engineered to produce human Aβ to define human-Aβ-dependent and -independent pathogenic mechanisms triggered by this variant. Interestingly, pre- and peri-adolescent <i>Trem2<sup>R47H</sup></i> rats present increased brain concentrations of TNF-α, augmented glutamatergic transmission, suppression of Long-term-Potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiological surrogate of learning and memory, but normal Ab levels. Acute reduction of TNF-α activity with a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody occludes the boost in amplitude of glutamatergic transmission and LTP suppression observed in young <i>Trem2<sup>R47H/R47H </sup></i>rats. Thus, the microglia-specific pathogenic <i>Trem2 </i>variant boosts glutamatergic neuronal transmission and suppresses LTP by increasing brain TNF-α concentrations, directly linking microglia to neuronal dysfunction. Future studies will determine whether this phenomenon represents an early, Aβ-independent pathway that facilitates dementia pathogenesis in humans.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57495">Differential accumulation of storage bodies with aging defines discrete subsets of microglia in the healthy brain</a></h4>

To date, microglia subsets in the healthy CNS have not been identified. Utilizing autofluorescence (AF) as a discriminating parameter, we identified two novel microglia subsets in both mice and non-human primates, termed autofluorescence-positive (AF<sup>+</sup>) and negative (AF<sup>-</sup>). While their proportion remained constant throughout most adult life, the AF signal linearly and specifically increased in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia with age and correlated with a commensurate increase in size and complexity of lysosomal storage bodies, as detected by transmission electron microscopy and LAMP1 levels. Post-depletion repopulation kinetics revealed AF<sup>-</sup> cells as likely precursors of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia. At the molecular level, the proteome of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia showed overrepresentation of endolysosomal, autophagic, catabolic, and mTOR-related proteins. Mimicking the effect of advanced aging, genetic disruption of lysosomal function accelerated the accumulation of storage bodies in AF<sup>+</sup> cells and led to impaired microglia physiology and cell death, suggestive of a mechanistic convergence between aging and lysosomal storage disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56627">Structural basis for capsid recruitment and coat formation during HSV-1 nuclear egress</a></h4>

During herpesvirus infection, egress of nascent viral capsids from the nucleus is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC). NEC deforms the inner nuclear membrane (INM) around the capsid by forming a hexagonal array. However, how the NEC coat interacts with the capsid and how curved coats are generated to enable budding is yet unclear. Here, by structure-guided truncations, confocal microscopy, and cryoelectron tomography, we show that binding of the capsid protein UL25 promotes the formation of NEC pentagons rather than hexagons. We hypothesize that during nuclear budding, binding of UL25 situated at the pentagonal capsid vertices to the NEC at the INM promotes formation of NEC pentagons that would anchor the NEC coat to the capsid. Incorporation of NEC pentagons at the points of contact with the vertices would also promote assembly of the curved hexagonal NEC coat around the capsid, leading to productive egress of UL25-decorated capsids.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56273">SynGAP isoforms differentially regulate synaptic plasticity and dendritic development</a></h4>

SynGAP is a synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) with four C-terminal splice variants: α1, α2, β, and γ. Although studies have implicated <i>SYNGAP1</i> in several cognitive disorders, it is not clear which SynGAP isoforms contribute to disease. Here, we demonstrate that SynGAP isoforms exhibit unique spatiotemporal expression patterns and play distinct roles in neuronal and synaptic development in mouse neurons. SynGAP-α1, which undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation with PSD-95, is highly enriched in synapses and is required for LTP. In contrast, SynGAP-β, which does not bind PSD-95 PDZ domains, is less synaptically targeted and promotes dendritic arborization. A mutation in SynGAP-α1 that disrupts phase separation and synaptic targeting abolishes its ability to regulate plasticity and instead causes it to drive dendritic development like SynGAP-β. These results demonstrate that distinct intrinsic biochemical properties of SynGAP isoforms determine their function, and individual isoforms may differentially contribute to the pathogenesis of <i>SYNGAP1</i>-related cognitive disorders.

The neurotoxicity of air pollution is undefined for sex and <i>APOE</i> alleles. These major risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were examined in mice given chronic exposure to nPM, a nano-sized subfraction of urban air pollution. In the cerebral cortex, female mice had two-fold more genes responding to nPM than males. Transcriptomic responses to nPM had sex-<i>APOE</i> interactions in AD-relevant pathways. Only <i>APOE</i>3 mice responded to nPM in genes related to Abeta deposition and clearance (<i>Vav2</i>, <i>Vav3</i>, <i>S1009a</i>). Other responding genes included axonal guidance, inflammation (AMPK, NFKB, APK/JNK signaling), and antioxidant signaling (NRF2, HIF1A). Genes downstream of NFKB and NRF2 responded in opposite directions to nPM. <i>Nrf2</i> knockdown in microglia augmented NFKB responses to nPM, suggesting a critical role of NRF2 in air pollution neurotoxicity. These findings give a rationale for epidemiologic studies of air pollution to consider sex interactions with <i>APOE</i> alleles and other AD-risk genes.

<p>by Nima Nouri, Steven H. Kleinstein</p>

Adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) offers the possibility of identifying and tracking B cell clonal expansions during adaptive immune responses. Members of a B cell clone are descended from a common ancestor and share the same initial V(D)J rearrangement, but their B cell receptore (BCR) sequence may differ due to the accumulation of somatic hypermutations (SHMs). Clonal relationships are learned from AIRR-seq data by analyzing the BCR sequence, with the most common methods focused on the highly diverse junction region. However, clonally related cells often share SHMs which have been accumulated during affinity maturation. Here, we investigate whether shared SHMs in the V and J segments of the BCR can be leveraged along with the junction sequence to improve the ability to identify clonally related sequences. We develop independent distance functions that capture junction similarity and shared mutations, and combine these in a spectral clustering framework to infer the BCR clonal relationships. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that this model improves both the sensitivity and specificity for identifying B cell clones.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we explored the associations between the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and hippocampal subfields in 127 healthy participants (18–85 years). MRI datasets were collected on a 4.7 T system. Participants were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale to evaluate episodic memory function. Significant associations of both polymorphisms were present only in older adults (≥50 years). BDNF polymorphism was associated with larger dentate gyrus volumes within the anterior hippocampus (head) in Met‐carriers compared to Val/Val homozygotes. We found that in Met‐carriers total hippocampal volume predicted performance on visuospatial memory tasks. APOE polymorphism was associated with larger total hippocampal volume, especially in cornu ammonis 1–3 and subiculum in APOE ɛ2 carriers compared to both ɛ4 and ɛ3 carriers, while APOE ɛ3 and ɛ4 carriers did not differ from each other. APOE polymorphism was associated with better performance on visuospatial memory tasks in APOE ε2 carriers in comparison to ε4 carriers.</p>

Worse delayed verbal recall correlated with volume loss on the dorsolateral side of the left vs right hippocampus, seen in the images on the left from the superior aspect. The greatest volume loss is shown by dark blue followed by light blue. Impairment of visual delayed recall correlated best with volume loss on the inferior surface of the midportion of the hippocampus on the right (right two images, viewed from the inferior surface).

<p>In less than 6 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has spread worldwide infecting nearly 6 million people and killing over 350,000. Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also involves multiple other organs, including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms, including virus‐induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and postinfectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID‐19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system, COVID‐19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain‐Barre syndrome, and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID‐19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. Although our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID‐19.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25775?af=R">Nilotinib Effects on Safety, Tolerability, and Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Preclinical evidence with nilotinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved drug for leukemia, indicates improvement in Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. We investigated whether nilotinib is safe, and detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This single‐center, phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was supported by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers. Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was taken orally once daily for 26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus placebo for another 26 weeks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD) age was 70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well‐tolerated, although more adverse events, particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg dose. In the nilotinib group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid burden was significantly reduced in the frontal lobe compared to the placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ40 was reduced at 6 months and Aβ42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group compared to the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (−27%) at 12 months and phospho‐tau‐181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the nilotinib group.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered in response to nilotinib treatment. These data support a larger, longer, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2020 <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:183–194 </b></p>

<p>We analyzed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution magnetic resonance images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients, and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both left TLE (LTLE) and right TLE (RTLE) patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8, RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8, visual 39 ± 6; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs RTLE 7%, <i>p </i> = 0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high versus low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counseling in TLE. ANN NEUROL 2020 <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:170–182 </b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R">Bridging Therapy or IV Thrombolysis in Minor Stroke with Large Vessel Occlusion</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whether bridging therapy (intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] followed by endovascular treatment) is superior to IVT alone in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicentric retrospective observational study including, in intention‐to‐treat, consecutive IVT‐treated minor strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤ 5) with LVO, with or without additional mechanical thrombectomy. Propensity‐score (inverse probability of treatment weighting) was used to reduce baseline between‐groups differences. The primary outcome was excellent outcome, that is, modified Rankin score 0 to 1 at 3 months follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, 598 patients were included (214 and 384 in the bridging therapy and IVT groups, respectively). Following propensity‐score weighting, the distribution of baseline clinical and radiological variables was similar across the two patient groups. Compared with IVT alone, bridging therapy was not associated with excellent outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75–1.24; <i>p </i> = 0.76), but was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 3.01; 95% CI = 1.77–5.11; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.0001). Occlusion site was a strong modifier of the effect of bridging therapy on outcome (<i>p </i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.0001), with bridging therapy associated with higher odds of excellent outcome in proximal M1 (OR = 3.26; 95% CI = 1.67–6.35; <i>p </i> = 0.0006) and distal M1 (OR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.01–2.82; <i>p </i> = 0.04) occlusions, but with lower odds of excellent outcome for M2 (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.38–0.75; <i>p = </i> 0.0003) occlusions. Bridging therapy was associated with higher rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in M2 occlusions only (OR = 4.40; 95% CI = 2.20–8.83; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.0001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although overall outcomes were similar in intended bridging therapy as compared to intended IVT alone in minor strokes with LVO, our results suggest that intended bridging therapy may be beneficial in M1 occlusions, whereas the benefit–risk profile may favor IVT alone in M2 occlusions.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate disease symptoms, and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multicenter cohort of pediatric anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age = 12.9 years, range =1–18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume <i>z </i> scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15 of 38 (39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain and gray matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and <i>z </i> score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score &gt; 1, incidence rate ratio = 3.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31–9.31, <i>p </i> = 0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset (odds ratio [OR] = 9.90, 95% CI = 2.51–17.28, <i>p </i> = 0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (OR = 13.71, 95% CI = 2.68–24.73, <i>p </i> = 0.015), and a treatment delay &gt; 4 weeks (OR = 5.15, 95% CI = 0.47–9.82, <i>p </i> = 0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &gt; 4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE. ANN NEUROL 2020 <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:148–159 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most of the patients with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human postmortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using Western blot analysis and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15–40 years old) and aged (40–65 years old) subjects with DS compared with controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 in both hippocampus (n = 33, Spearman = −0.59 to −0.38, <i>p </i> ≤ 0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n = 57, Spearman = −0.46 to −0.27, <i>p </i> ≤ 0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]) is partly due to central nervous system (CNS) hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here, we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in 2 MS models.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A variety of methods have been used to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function, and tissue perfusion in EAE.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE and a model of the early MS lesion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE, and the model of the early MS lesion, seem to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72 </i> expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in <i>C9orf72 </i> expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and cortical surface area (CSA). Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and noncarriers by testing the “age by genetic status” interaction. False discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic <i>C9orf72 </i> carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers, and 249 controls (age range = 18–86 years). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporoparietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial frontoparietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventrofrontal regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72 </i> mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2020 <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:113–122 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Although postmortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established premortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 was conducted for those who responded by March 2019.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Despite being a postmortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 years reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3% versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions, and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions, or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a postmortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. Although underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>During the natural course of multiple sclerosis (MS), the brain is exposed to aging as well as disease effects. Brain aging can be modeled statistically; the so‐called “brain‐age” paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression, and future outcomes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a longitudinal, multicenter sample of 3,565 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in 1,204 patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured “brain‐predicted age” using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD among patients with MS and patients with CIS and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with MS had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.5–12.1] versus 4.3 years; 95% CI = 2.1 to 6.4; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+13.3 years; 95% CI = 11.3–15.3). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.03; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001); although normalized brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualized brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualized EDSS score (r = 0.26; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, “brain‐age” could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter (WM) lesions to thalamic volume.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used postmortem in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (<i>p </i> = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex, and T2 lesion volume, the total (<i>p </i> = 0.20), ovoid (<i>p </i> = 0.31), or subependymal (<i>p </i> = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman’s rho = −0.65, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest the degeneration of efferent/afferent thalamic projections and/or a neurodegenerative process as greater contributors to thalamic atrophy than thalamic demyelinating lesions. ANN NEUROL 2020 <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:81–92 </b></p>

<p>This study sought to examine the influence of age and sex on morphometric measurements of the corpus callosum (CC) within Middle Eastern Arab population, in order to obtain reference data and conduct racial comparisons with previously reported measurements from other ethnicities. Furthermore, it aimed to investigate CC variations that may occur in children with autism. To this end, magnetic resonance images of normal brains were acquired from three different age groups, consisting of children, younger adults, and older adults. Brain images were also acquired from boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The CC length, area, and thickness were measured. The CC length was smaller in children than in the other age groups, but no difference in CC length was found between younger and older adults. The CC area and thickness were greater in younger adults than in children and older adults, and greater in older adults than in children. With regard to sexual dimorphism, the CC area and forebrain volume were larger in male children than in female children. No sex-related differences in CC area or thickness were found in adults. However, the ratio of CC area to the forebrain volume was greater in adult females than in males, owing to the smaller forebrain volume in females. The absolute length of the CC was greater in older adult males than in their female counterparts. In addition, significant differences in CC measurements were found in comparison to measurements obtained from other ethnicities. Lastly, significant reductions in CC area and thickness were found in boys with ASD compared to their neurotypical peers. In conclusion, age and sex significantly influence morphometric measurements of CC in Middle Eastern Arab population. This study points to the presence of racial differences in CC size. Finally, it reveals that children with ASD display a distinct reduction in CC size compared to neurotypical children of the same ethnicity.</p>

<p>Amongst other approaches, adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) have recently been tested with respect to their regenerative capacity for treatment of neuromuscular disorders. While beneficial effects of ASCs on muscle recovery were observed previously, their impact on regeneration of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is unclear. Here, we used a murine glycerol damage model to study disruption and regeneration of NMJs and to evaluate the effects of systemic application of ASCs on muscle and NMJ recovery. In mice that were not treated with ASCs, a differential response of NMJ pre- and post-synapses to glycerol-induced damage was observed. While post-synapses were still present in regions that were necrotic and lacking actin and dystrophin, pre-synapses disappeared soon in those affected areas. Partial regeneration of NMJs occurred within 11 days after damage. ASC treatment slightly enhanced NMJ recovery and reduced the loss of presynaptic sites, but also led to a late phase of muscle necrosis and fibrosis. In summary, the results suggest a differential sensitivity of NMJ pre- and post-synapses to glycerol-induced muscle damage and that the use of ASC for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders needs further careful evaluation.</p>

<p>Transthyretin variant amyloidosis (ATTRv) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid in many organs, mostly causing a sensory-motor neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and dysautonomia. The aim of the study was to report microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile identified in the blood of ATTRv patients. Ten ATTRv patients, 10 asymptomatic carriers of transthyretin variant (TTRv), 10 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, and 10 healthy controls were studied. Human Schwann cells cultures were used to study the regulatory effects of miR-150-5p on the expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF). ATTRv patients had 33 miRNAs up-regulated and 48 down-regulated versus healthy controls; 9 miRNAs were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated versus CMT patients; 19 miRNAs were up-regulated and 38 down-regulated versus asymptomatic TTRv carriers. Twelve out of the 19 upregulated miRNAs had a fold increase higher than 100. The validation experiment indicated miR-150-5p as a valuable biomarker to differentiate ATTRv patients from asymptomatic TTRv carriers (AUC: 0.9728; p &lt; 0.0001). Schwann cells culture model demonstrated that miR-150-5p is a powerful negative regulator of CREB, BDNF, and NGF genes. Identification of deregulated miRNAs can help in understanding the complex pathomechamism underlying the development of ATTRv and related multisystemic pathology. Further investigations are needed on the role of circulating miR-150-5p to predict the shift of TTRv carriers from an asymptomatic status to symptoms appearance.</p>

<p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experience cognitive deficits but the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not known. We therefore applied Granger causality analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the effective connectivity (EC) of the hippocampus in patients with T2DM. Eighty six patients with T2DM and 84 matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The directional EC between anatomically defined seeds in left hippocampus (LHIP) and right hippocampus (RHIP) and other brain regions was compared between T2DM and HC and Pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine whether alterations in EC were related to clinical characteristics of diabetes. Compared with HC, patients with T2DM had altered EC between LHIP and RHIP and the default mode network (DMN), occipital cortex and cerebellum. In addition, for LHIP only duration of diabetes positively correlated with decreased inflow from right postcentral gyrus and right parietal lobe, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) negatively correlated with decreased inflow from right thalamus (r = −0.255, p = 0.018) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) negatively correlated with decreased inflow from left inferior parietal lobe (r = −0.206, p = 0.05). The altered EC between hippocampus and DMN is interpreted to be related to cognitive deficits in patients with T2DM particularly affecting memory and learning.</p>

<p>Mutations in tubby like protein 1 gene (TULP1) are causative of early-onset recessive inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs); similarly, the Tulp1-/- mouse is also characterized by a rapid IRD. Tulp1 mRNA and protein expression was analyzed in wild type mouse retinas and expression data sets (NCBI) during early postnatal development. Comparative histology was undertaken in Tulp1-/-, rhodopsin-/- (Rho-/-) and retinal degeneration slow-/- (Rds-/-) mouse retinas. Bioinformatic analysis of predicted TULP1 interactors and IRD genes was performed. Peak expression of Tulp1 in healthy mouse retinas was detected at p8; of note, TULP1 was detected in both the outer and inner retina. Bioinformatic analysis indicated Tulp1 expression in retinal progenitor, photoreceptor and non-photoreceptor cells. While common features of photoreceptor degeneration were detected in Tulp1-/-, Rho-/-, and Rds-/- retinas, other alterations in bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells were specific to Tulp1-/- mice. Additionally, predicted TULP1 interactors differed in various retinal cell types and new functions for TULP1 were suggested. A pilot bioinformatic analysis indicated that in a similar fashion to Tulp1, many other IRD genes were expressed in both inner and outer retinal cells at p4–p7. Our data indicate that expression of Tulp1 extends to multiple retinal cell types; lack of TULP1 may lead to primary degeneration not only of photoreceptor but also non-photoreceptor cells. Predicted interactors suggest widespread retinal functions for TULP1. Early and widespread expression of TULP1 and some other IRD genes in both the inner and outer retina highlights potential hurdles in the development of treatments for these IRDs.</p>

Background<p>Selective loss of dopaminergic neurons and diminished putamen gray matter volume (GMV) represents a central feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent studies have reported specific effects of kinectin 1 gene (KTN1) variants on the putamen GMV.</p>Objective<p>To examine the relationship of KTN1 variants, KTN1 mRNA expression in the putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), putamen GMV, and PD.</p>Methods<p>We examined the associations between PD and a total of 1847 imputed KTN1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in one discovery sample [2,000 subjects with PD vs. 1,986 healthy controls (HC)], and confirmed the nominally significant associations (p &lt; 0.05) in two replication samples (900 PD vs. 867 HC, and 940 PD vs. 801 HC, respectively). The regulatory effects of risk variants on the KTN1 mRNA expression in putamen and SNc and the putamen GMV were tested. We also quantified the expression levels of KTN1 mRNA in the putamen and/or SNc for comparison between PD and HC in five independent cohorts.</p>Results<p>Six replicable and two non-replicable KTN1-PD associations were identified (0.009 ≤ p ≤ 0.049). The major alleles of five SNPs, including rs12880292, rs8017172, rs17253792, rs945270, and rs4144657, significantly increased risk for PD (0.020 ≤ p ≤ 0.049) and putamen GMVs (19.08 ≤ β ≤ 60.38; 2.82 ≤ Z ≤ 15.03; 5.0 × 10<sup>–51</sup> ≤ p ≤ 0.018). The risk alleles of five SNPs, including rs8017172, rs17253792, rs945270, rs4144657, and rs1188184 also significantly increased the KTN1 mRNA expression in the putamen or SNc (0.021 ≤ p ≤ 0.046). The KTN1 mRNA was abundant in the putamen and/or SNc across five independent cohorts and differentially expressed in the SNc between PD and HC in one cohort (p = 0.047).</p>Conclusion<p>There was a consistent, significant, replicable, and robust positive relationship among the KTN1 variants, PD risk, KTN1 mRNA expression in putamen, and putamen volumes, and a modest relation between PD risk and KTN1 mRNA expression in SNc, suggesting that KTN1 may play a functional role in the development of PD.</p>

<p>The brain-computer interface (BCI) provides an alternative means to communicate and it has sparked growing interest in the past two decades. Specifically, for Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based BCI, marked improvement has been made in the frequency recognition method and data sharing. However, the number of pubic databases is still limited in this field. Therefore, we present a BEnchmark database Towards BCI Application (BETA) in the study. The BETA database is composed of 64-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 70 subjects performing a 40-target cued-spelling task. The design and the acquisition of the BETA are in pursuit of meeting the demand from real-world applications and it can be used as a test-bed for these scenarios. We validate the database by a series of analyses and conduct the classification analysis of eleven frequency recognition methods on BETA. We recommend using the metric of wide-band signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and BCI quotient to characterize the SSVEP at the single-trial and population levels, respectively. The BETA database can be downloaded from the following link http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.</p>

<p>HDAC6 is a unique histone deacetylase that targets cytoplasmic non-histone proteins and has a specific ubiquitin-binding activity. Both of these activities are required for HDAC6-mediated formation of aggresomes, which contain misfolded proteins that will ultimately be degraded via autophagy. HDAC6 deacetylase activity is increased following phosphorylation on serine 22 (phospho-HDAC6). In human, HDAC6 localizes in neuronal Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and in oligodendrocytic Papp–Lantos bodies in multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, the expression of phospho-HDAC6 in post-mortem human brains is currently unexplored. Here, we evaluate and compare the distribution of HDAC6 and its phosphorylated form in human brains obtained from patients affected by three forms of parkinsonism: two synucleinopathies (PD and MSA) and a tauopathy (progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP). We find that both HDAC6 and its phosphorylated form localize with pathological protein aggregates, including α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies in PD and Papp–Lantos bodies in MSA, and phospho-tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles in PSP. We further find a direct interaction of HDAC6 with α-synuclein with proximity ligation assay (PLA) in neuronal cell of PD patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that both HDAC6 and phospho-HDAC6 regulate the homeostasis of intra-neuronal proteins in parkinsonism.</p>

<p>Cognitive workload is one of the widely invoked human factors in the areas of human–machine interaction (HMI) and neuroergonomics. The precise assessment of cognitive and mental workload (MWL) is vital and requires accurate neuroimaging to monitor and evaluate the cognitive states of the brain. In this study, we have decoded four classes of MWL using long short-term memory (LSTM) with 89.31% average accuracy for brain–computer interface (BCI). The brain activity signals are acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region of the brain. We performed a supervised MWL experimentation with four varying MWL levels on 15 participants (both male and female) and 10 trials of each MWL per participant. Real-time four-level MWL states are assessed using fNIRS system, and initial classification is performed using three strong machine learning (ML) techniques, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and artificial neural network (ANN) with obtained average accuracies of 54.33, 54.31, and 69.36%, respectively. In this study, novel deep learning (DL) frameworks are proposed, which utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM with 87.45 and 89.31% average accuracies, respectively, to solve high-dimensional four-level cognitive states classification problem. Statistical analysis, t-test, and one-way F-test (ANOVA) are also performed on accuracies obtained through ML and DL algorithms. Results show that the proposed DL (LSTM and CNN) algorithms significantly improve classification performance as compared with ML (SVM, ANN, and k-NN) algorithms.</p>

<p>This manuscript reviews historical and recent studies that focus on supplementary sensory feedback for use in upper limb prostheses. It shows that the inability of many studies to speak to the issue of meaningful performance improvements in real-life scenarios is caused by the complexity of the interactions of supplementary sensory feedback with other types of feedback along with other portions of the motor control process. To do this, the present manuscript frames the question of supplementary feedback from the perspective of computational motor control, providing a brief review of the main advances in that field over the last 20 years. It then separates the studies on the closed-loop prosthesis control into distinct categories, which are defined by relating the impact of feedback to the relevant components of the motor control framework, and reviews the work that has been done over the last 50+ years in each of those categories. It ends with a discussion of the studies, along with suggestions for experimental construction and connections with other areas of research, such as machine learning.</p>

<p>Despite the increasing popularity of neurofeedback, its mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. This study aims to describe the processes underlying implicit electroencephalographic neurofeedback. Fifty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a single session of infra-low frequency neurofeedback or sham neurofeedback, with electrodes over the right middle temporal gyrus and the right inferior parietal lobule. They observed a moving rocket, the speed of which was modulated by the waveform derived from a band-limited infra-low frequency filter. Immediately before and after the session, the participants underwent a resting-state fMRI. Network-based statistical analysis was applied, comparing post- vs. pre-session and real vs. sham neurofeedback conditions. As a result, two phenomena were observed. First, we described a brain circuit related to the implicit neurofeedback process itself, consisting of the lateral occipital cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, right ventral striatum, and bilateral dorsal striatum. Second, we found increased connectivity between key regions of the salience, language, and visual networks, which is indicative of integration in sensory processing. Thus, it appears that a single session of implicit infra-low frequency electroencephalographic neurofeedback leads to significant changes in intrinsic brain connectivity.</p>

<p>The ventral visual stream (VVS) is a fundamental pathway involved in visual object identification and recognition. In this work, we present a hypothesis of a sequence of computations performed by the VVS during object recognition. The operations performed by the inferior temporal (IT) cortex are represented as not being akin to a neural-network, but rather in-line with a dynamic inference instantiation of the untangling notion. The presentation draws upon a technique for dynamic maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) sequence estimation based on the Viterbi algorithm. Simulation results are presented to show that the decoding portion of the architecture that is associated with the IT can effectively untangle object identity when presented with synthetic data. More importantly, we take a step forward in visual neuroscience by presenting a framework for an inference-based approach that is biologically inspired via attributes implicated in primate object recognition. The analysis will provide insight in explaining the exceptional proficiency of the VVS.</p>

<p>Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs), which consist of five homologous cytosolic proteins, are one of the major phosphoproteins in the developing nervous system. The prominent feature of the CRMP family proteins is a new class of microtubule-associated proteins that play important roles in the whole process of developing the nervous system, such as axon guidance, synapse maturation, cell migration, and even in adult brain function. The CRMP C-terminal region is subjected to posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, which, in turn, regulates the interaction between the CRMPs and various kinds of proteins including receptors, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins, and motor proteins. The gene-knockout of the CRMP family proteins produces different phenotypes, thereby showing distinct roles of all CRMP family proteins. Also, the phenotypic analysis of a non-phosphorylated form of CRMP2-knockin mouse model, and studies of pharmacological responses to CRMP-related drugs suggest that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology in neuronal development, regeneration, and neurodegenerative disorders, thus showing CRMPs as promising target molecules for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<p>CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>) are abundantly expressed in the nervous system where they regulate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). However, the role of CB<sub>1</sub>-stimulated FAK 925 tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) in regulating ERK1/2 activation remains undefined. Here, immunoblotting analyses using antibodies against FAK phospho-Tyr 925 and ERK2 phospho-Tyr 204 demonstrated CB<sub>1</sub>-stimulated FAK 925 Tyr-P and ERK2 204 Tyr-P (0–5 min) which was followed by a decline in Tyr-P (5–20 min). CB<sub>1</sub> stimulated FAK-Grb2 association and Ras-mediated ERK2 activation. The FAK inhibitors Y11 and PF 573228 abolished FAK 925 Tyr-P and partially inhibited ERK2 204 Tyr-P. FAK 925 Tyr-P and ERK2 204 Tyr-P were adhesion-dependent, required an intact actin cytoskeleton, and were mediated by integrins, Flk-1 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and epidermal growth factor receptors. FAK 925 Tyr-P and ERK2 204 Tyr-P were blocked by the Gβγ inhibitor gallein, a GRK2 inhibitor, and GRK2 siRNA silencing, suggesting Gβγ and GRK2 participate in FAK-mediated ERK2 activation. Together, these studies indicate FAK 925 Tyr-P occurs concurrently with CB<sub>1</sub>-stimulated ERK2 activation and requires the actin cytoskeleton and G<sub>i/o</sub>βγ-GRK2-mediated cross-talk between CB<sub>1</sub>, integrins, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).</p>

<p>In the past years, several theories have been advanced to explain the pathogenesis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a neuropsychiatric disease that causes disability in general population. Several theories have been proposed to define the MDD pathophysiology such as the classic “monoamine-theory” or the “glutamate hypothesis.” All these theories have been recently integrated by evidence highlighting inflammation as a pivotal player in developing depressive symptoms. Proinflammatory cytokines have been indeed claimed to contribute to stress-induced mood disturbances and to major depression, indicating a widespread role of classical mediators of inflammation in emotional control. Moreover, during systemic inflammatory diseases, peripherally released cytokines circulate in the blood, reach the brain and cause anxiety, anhedonia, social withdrawal, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Accordingly, chronic inflammatory disorders, such as the inflammatory autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS), have been associated to higher risk of MDD, in comparison with overall population. Importantly, in both MS patients and in its experimental mouse model, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), the notion that depressive symptoms are reactive epiphenomenon to the MS pathology has been recently challenged by the evidence of their early manifestation, even before the onset of the disease. Furthermore, in association to such mood disturbance, inflammatory-dependent synaptic dysfunctions in several areas of MS/EAE brain have been observed independently of brain lesions and demyelination. This evidence suggests that a fine interplay between the immune and nervous systems can have a huge impact on several neurological functions, including depressive symptoms, in different pathological conditions. The aim of the present review is to shed light on common traits between MDD and MS, by looking at inflammatory-dependent synaptic alterations associated with depression in both diseases.</p>

<p>The present study shows new evidence of functional connectivity between the trigeminal main sensory (NVsnpr) and motor (NVmt) nuclei in rats and mice. NVsnpr neurons projecting to NVmt are most highly concentrated in its dorsal half. Their electrical stimulation induced multiphasic excitatory synaptic responses in trigeminal MNs and evoked calcium responses mainly in the jaw-closing region of NVmt. Induction of rhythmic bursting in NVsnpr neurons by local applications of BAPTA also elicited rhythmic firing or clustering of postsynaptic potentials in trigeminal motoneurons, further emphasizing the functional relationship between these two nuclei in terms of rhythm transmission. Biocytin injections in both nuclei and calcium-imaging in one of the two nuclei during electrical stimulation of the other revealed a specific pattern of connectivity between the two nuclei, which organization seemed to critically depend on the dorsoventral location of the stimulation site within NVsnpr with the most dorsal areas of NVsnpr projecting to the dorsolateral region of NVmt and intermediate areas projecting to ventromedial NVmt. This study confirms and develops earlier experiments by exploring the physiological nature and functional topography of the connectivity between NVsnpr and NVmt that was demonstrated in the past with neuroanatomical techniques.</p>

<p>Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a family of serine proteases that when dysregulated may contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the present review article, we describe what is known about their physiological and pathological roles with an emphasis on KLK6 and KLK8, two KLKs that are highly expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Altered expression and activity of KLK6 have been linked to brain physiology and the development of multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, altered levels of KLK6 in the brain and serum of people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease have been documented, pointing out to its function in amyloid metabolism and development of synucleinopathies. People who have structural genetic variants of KLK8 can suffer mental illnesses such as intellectual and learning disabilities, seizures, and autism. Increased expression of KLK8 has also been implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Also, we discuss the possible link that exists between KLKs activity and certain viral infections that can affect the nervous system. Although little is known about the exact mechanisms that mediate KLKs function and their participation in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders will open a new field to develop novel therapies to modulate their levels and/or activity and their harmful effects on the CNS.</p>

<p>Demyelination and axon degeneration are major events in all neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Intoxication of oligodendrocytes with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is often used as a selective model of focal and reversible demyelination thought to have no incidence for neurons. To characterize the cascade of cellular events involved in LPC-induced demyelination, we have combined intravital coherent antistoke Raman scattering microscopy with intravital two-photon fluorescence microscopy in multicolor transgenic reporter mice. Moreover, taking advantage of a unique technique of spinal glass window implantation, we here provide the first longitudinal description of cell dynamics in the same volume of interest over weeks after insults. We have detected several patterns of axon–myelin interactions and classified them in early and advanced events. Unexpectedly, we have found that oligodendrocyte damages are followed by axon degeneration within 2 days after LPC incubation, and this degeneration is amplified after the recruitment of the peripheral proinflammatory cells at day 4. Beyond day 7, the recovery of axon number and myelin takes 3 more weeks postlesion and involves a new wave of anti-inflammatory innate immune cells at day 14. Therefore, recurrent imaging over several weeks suggests an important role of peripheral immune cells in regulating both the axonal and oligodendroglial fates and thereby the remyelination status. Better understanding the recruitment of peripheral immune cells during demyelinating events should help to improve diagnosis and therapy.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are characterized by a progressive loss of selective neuron subtypes in the central nervous system (CNS). Although various factors account for the initiation and development of these diseases, accumulating evidence shows that impaired mitochondrial function is a prominent and common mechanism. Mitochondria play a critical role in neurons and are involved in energy production, cellular metabolism regulation, intracellular calcium homeostasis, immune responses, and cell fate. Thus, cells in the CNS heavily rely on mitochondrial integrity. Many aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction are manifested in neurodegenerative diseases, including aberrant mitochondrial quality control (mitoQC), mitochondrial-driven inflammation, and bioenergetic defects. Herein, we briefly summarize the molecular basis of mitoQC, including mitochondrial proteostasis, biogenesis, dynamics, and organelle degradation. We also focus on the research, to date, regarding aberrant mitoQC and mitochondrial-driven inflammation in several common neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we outline novel therapeutic strategies that target aberrant mitoQC in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00120">IL-6 in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Signals Disease Activity in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

<p>Specific proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules could represent useful cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to predict the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS). The proinflammatory molecule interleukin (IL)-6 has been investigated in the pathophysiology of MS and has been associated in previous smaller studies to increased disability and disease activity. Here, we wanted to further address IL-6 as a possible CSF biomarker of MS by investigating its detectability in a large cohort of 534 MS patients and in 103 individuals with other non-inflammatory neurological diseases. In these newly diagnosed patients, we also explored correlations between IL-6 detectability, MS phenotypes, and disease characteristics. We found that IL-6 was more frequently detectable in the CSF of MS patients compared with their control counterparts as significant differences emerged between patients with Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), Relapsing–remitting (RR), and secondary progressive and primary progressive MS compared to non-inflammatory controls. IL-6 was equally present in the CSF of all MS phenotypes. In RR MS patients, IL-6 detectability was found to signal clinically and/or radiologically defined disease activity, among all other clinical characteristics. Our results add further evidence that CSF proinflammatory cytokines could be useful for the identification of those MS patients who are prone to increased disease activity. In particular, IL-6 could represent an interesting prognostic biomarker of MS, as also demonstrated in other diseases where CSF IL-6 was found to identify patients with worse disease severity.</p>

Background<p>Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common age-related vascular disease of the brain associated with slowly accumulating tissue damage. At present, total CSVD burden score is a commonly used method to evaluate the severity of the disease.</p>Purpose<p>To observe whether global and regional cerebral perfusion is related to total CSVD score and to explore global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in patients with different degrees of CSVD.</p>Methods<p>We collected 130 subjects with different total burden score of CSVD (0 point: 33 subjects, 1 point: 39 subjects, 2 points: 24 subjects, 3 points: 24 subjects, 4 points: 10 subjects). Total CSVD burden score was evaluated by clinically routine sequences (T2WI, T2-FLAIR, T1WI, DWI, and SWAN sequence). Global and regional CBF were calculated and correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between total CSVD score and CBF of the whole brain and several brain regions.</p>Results<p>The analysis results showed that there was a negative correlation between total CSVD burden score and global CBF (r = −0.33, p = 0.001). Total CSVD burden score also had moderately negative correlations with CBF of almost all the brain regions.</p>Conclusion<p>CSVD is a disease that affects the whole brain. With the increase of total CSVD burden score, the global and regional CBF decreased. The CSVD total burden score could be used to evaluate the overall condition of brain perfusion.</p>

Background<p>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the severe complications after surgery, inducing low life quality and high mortality, especially in elderly patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of POCD remains largely unknown, and the ideal biomarker for clinical diagnosis and prognosis is lacking. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), as a unique class of non-coding RNAs, were characterized by its stability and conservativeness, serving as novel biomarkers in various diseases. Nevertheless, the role of circRNAs in the occurrence of POCD remains elusive.</p>Methods<p>To investigate the differentially expressed circRNAs in the serum of POCD patients and its potential role in the development of POCD, we performed a circRNA microarray to screen the differentially expressed circRNAs in the serum samples from three patients of the POCD group and three paired patients of the non-POCD group. Subsequently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) was utilized to verify the microarray data with the serum samples from 10 paired patients. Cytoscape software was used to construct the circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network for circRNAs with different expression levels as well as the target genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed the biological functions of the differentially expressed circRNAs target genes.</p>Results<p>In total, we have analyzed 10,198 circRNAs through the microarray. Compared with the non-POCD patient group, there were 210 differentially expressed circRNAs with 133 upregulated and 77 downregulated in the POCD group (≥2-fold differential expression, P ≤ 0.05). The qRT-PCR confirmed 10 circRNAs with different expressed levels, and the results were consistent with the microarray findings. Among them, hsa_circRNA_001145, hsa_circRNA_101138, and hsa_circRNA_061570 had the highest magnitude of change. The GO analysis showed that the differentially expressed circRNAs were associated with the regulation of the developmental process, cell-to-cell adhesion, and nervous system development. The KEGG analysis showed that the target genes of circRNAs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway and RAS signaling pathway. According to the targetscan7.1 and mirdbV5 databases, the circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was constructed, and these results provided a vital landscape of circRNA expression profile in POCD.</p>Conclusions<p>Our study provides an essential perspective for the differential expression of circRNAs in POCD patients. Further studies need to be performed to explore their potential therapeutic roles in the development of POCD.</p>

Purpose<p>The contribution of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) to the development of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to retrospectively assess the relationship between WMH burden and unilateral ICAS by combined examination of lumen stenosis, plaque enhancement, and cerebral perfusion.</p>Materials and methods<p>A cross-sectional study of 41 patients with symptomatic unilateral ICAS (mean age 57 ± 10 years; 26 males) was conducted. Detailed clinical data, including vascular risk factors, were obtained. WMH volume was derived from 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) and was assessed by using a validated semi-automated protocol. Lumen stenosis, plaque enhancement, and cerebral perfusion (assessed on time-to-peak parameter using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (TTP-ASPECTS) scale) were evaluated. The WMH volumes of peri-ventricular (PWMH) and deep (DWMH) white matter were calculated separately and compared between hemispheres. Associations between WMH volume (inter-hemispheric volume difference, ipsilateral and contralateral to the ICAS site separately), unilateral ICAS imaging metrics, and vascular risk factors were assessed by using linear regression.</p>Results<p>The DWMH volume ipsilateral to the ICAS site (ipsilateral DWMH volume) was significantly greater than that of the contralateral site (P &lt; 0.001), while the PWMH volume difference between hemispheres did not reach statistical significance. The inter-hemispheric DWMH volume difference was significantly associated with a higher plaque enhancement grade (β = 0.436, P = 0.005) and inversely associated with cerebral hypoperfusion (lower TTP-ASPECTS) (β = −0.613, P &lt; 0.001). In the between-subject multivariable regression analysis, while older age (β = 0.323, P = 0.025), hypoperfusion (β = −0.394, P = 0.007), and hypertension (β = 0.378, P = 0.011) were independently associated with ipsilateral DWMH volume, plaque enhancement did not show an association with ipsilateral DWMH volume. The association between ipsilateral DWMH volume and lumen stenosis approached statistical significance (β = 0.274, P = 0.084).</p>Conclusion<p>The DWMH was attributed to chronic hypoperfusion secondary to atherosclerotic stenosis. The association between the asymmetry of deep white matter lesions and plaque enhancement might suggest that increased deep white matter lesions are those ischemic lesions, which are more prone to the development of stroke.</p>

Recent studies provided strong evidence that deficits in cholinergic signaling cause disorders of cognition and affect conscious processing. Technical advances that combine molecular approaches, in vivo recordings in awake behaving animals, human brain imaging, and genetics have strengthened our understanding of the roles of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the modulation of cognitive behavior and network dynamics. Here, we review the emergent role of nAChRs in high-order cognitive processes and discuss recent work implicating cholinergic circuits in cognitive control, including conscious processing.

Genetic loss of Morrbid makes leukemic cells vulnerable to apoptosis and mitigates the progression of myeloid neoplasms.

Modeling diseases in non-human species is complicated as many enhancers that regulate expression are species specific. Castelijns et al. demonstrate that species-specific enhancers are highly variable and poorly integrated in the regulatory network, suggesting their biological impact is low. Instead, disease-associated enhancers are typically conserved and can therefore be modeled.

Mylvaganam et al. show that an apical CD44-spectrin “picket fence” alters the behavior of endothelial selectins, curtailing their mobility, inducing their apical accumulation, and favoring their clustering within caveolae. Both components of this picket fence are required for efficient capture, rolling, and firm adhesion of leukocytes.

Infraorbital nerve cut causes functional and structural remodeling of neural circuits in the somatosensory thalamus, forming the basis for somatotopic reorganization and ectopic sensations. Nagumo et al. report that injury-induced potentiation of extrasynaptic GABAAR currents are a key player in induction and maintenance of the remodeling and ectopic somatic sensations.

Socodato et al. show that ablating Rhoa in microglia of young adult mice is sufficient to produce major hallmarks of AD (including amyloid pathology, impairment of long-term synaptic plasticity, synapse loss, and memory deficits), suggesting that disrupting Rho GTPase signaling in microglia might underlie the neurodegenerative process in AD.

In analyzing 8,279 sample-specific gene regulatory networks, Lopes-Ramos et al. find significant sex differences in gene regulation across all 29 tissues analyzed. Transcription factors have sex-biased targeting patterns, and sex-biased target genes are associated with each tissue’s function and with diseases specific to that tissue.

Nakajo et al. show that 6-day starvation potentiates the winner-associated dHbL-d/iIPN pathway by prolonging AMPAR activity in the dIPN region through increasing the expression level of an alternative splicing variant of AMPAR subunits, gria3b-flip. These neuromodulations in the dIPN are induced by the orexin/hypocretin signal that is activated in a starved state.

Odell et al. show regions within neuronal genes with bistable DNA methylation states that are associated with gene expression, excitability, and activation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These data suggest that the methylation state of bistable regions dictates, via modulating gene expression, neuron eligibility to a coding ensemble.

Clustering of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses is crucial for synaptic inhibition. Rajgor et al. discover that synaptic GABAAR expression is controlled by their local translation, regulated by miR376c. During inhibitory synaptic potentiation, miR376c is downregulated, relieving its translational repression of GABAAR mRNAs and leading to de novo synthesis of dendritic GABAARs.

Two E3 ubiquitin ligases separately act on distinct components of this complex to phase their clearance. Failure to degrade a key component, the Smaug RNA-binding protein, disrupts an orderly maternal-to-zygotic transition.

Post-translational modification (PTM) sites have become popular for predictor development. However, with the exception of phosphorylation and a handful of other examples, PTMs suffer from a limited number of available training examples and sparsity in protein sequences. Here, proline hydroxylation is taken as an example to compare different methods and evaluate their performance on new experimentally determined sites. As a guide for effective experimental design, predictors require both high specificity and sensitivity. However, the self-reported performance may often not be indicative of prediction quality and detection of new sites is not guaranteed. We have benchmarked seven published hydroxylation site predictors on two newly constructed independent datasets. The self-reported performance is found to widely overestimate the real accuracy measured on independent datasets. No predictor performs better than random on new examples, indicating the refined models do not sufficiently generalize to detect new sites. The number of false positives is high and precision low, in particular for non-collagen proteins whose motifs are not conserved. As hydroxylation site predictors do not generalize for new data, caution is advised when using PTM predictors in the absence of independent evaluations, in particular for highly specific sites involved in signalling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xIIeNE3RgP0" width="1" />

Contemporary reinforcement learning (RL) theory suggests that potential choices can be evaluated by strategies that may or may not be sensitive to the computational structure of tasks. A paradigmatic model-free (MF) strategy simply repeats actions that have been rewarded in the past; by contrast, model-sensitive (MS) strategies exploit richer information associated with knowledge of task dynamics. MF and MS strategies should typically be combined, because they have complementary statistical and computational strengths; however, this tradeoff between MF/MS RL has mostly only been demonstrated in humans, often with only modest numbers of trials. We trained rhesus monkeys to perform a two-stage decision task designed to elicit and discriminate the use of MF and MS methods. A descriptive analysis of choice behaviour revealed directly that the structure of the task (of MS importance) and the reward history (of MF and MS importance) significantly influenced both choice and response vigour. A detailed, trial-by-trial computational analysis confirmed that choices were made according to a combination of strategies, with a dominant influence of a particular form of model sensitivity that persisted over weeks of testing. The residuals from this model necessitated development of a new combined RL model which incorporates a particular credit assignment weighting procedure. Finally, response vigor exhibited a subtly different collection of MF and MS influences. These results provide new illumination onto RL behavioural processes in non-human primates.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HS__dLvZ-Mw" width="1" />

<p>by Satoshi Ii, Hiroki Kitade, Shunichi Ishida, Yohsuke Imai, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Shigeo Wada</p>

The cerebral vasculature has a complex and hierarchical network, ranging from vessels of a few millimeters to superficial cortical vessels with diameters of a few hundred micrometers, and to the microvasculature (arteriole/venule) and capillary beds in the cortex. In standard imaging techniques, it is difficult to segment all vessels in the network, especially in the case of the human brain. This study proposes a hybrid modeling approach that determines these networks by explicitly segmenting the large vessels from medical images and employing a novel vascular generation algorithm. The framework enables vasculatures to be generated at coarse and fine scales for individual arteries and veins with vascular subregions, following the personalized anatomy of the brain and macroscale vasculatures. In this study, the vascular structures of superficial cortical (pial) vessels before they penetrate the cortex are modeled as a mesoscale vasculature. The validity of the present approach is demonstrated through comparisons with partially observed data from existing measurements of the vessel distributions on the brain surface, pathway fractal features, and vascular territories of the major cerebral arteries. Additionally, this validation provides some biological insights: (i) vascular pathways may form to ensure a reasonable supply of blood to the local surface area; (ii) fractal features of vascular pathways are not sensitive to overall and local brain geometries; and (iii) whole pathways connecting the upstream and downstream entire-scale cerebral circulation are highly dependent on the local curvature of the cerebral sulci.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EfM0TEKsLq4" width="1" />

<p>by A. Ivanenko, P. Watkins, M. A. J. van Gerven, K. Hammerschmidt, B. Englitz</p>

Vocalizations are widely used for communication between animals. Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts. During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information. Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs and using 24 extracted features per USV, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features. The same network architecture was also able to achieve above-chance classification for cortexless mice, which were considered indistinguishable before. In summary, spectrotemporal differences between male and female USVs allow at least their partial classification, which enables sexual recognition between mice and automated attribution of USVs during analysis of social interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DSBqzv-Xors" width="1" />

Inflammation and infection can trigger local tissue Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation. This Na<sup>+</sup>-rich environment boosts proinflammatory activation of monocyte/macrophage-like cells (MΦs) and their antimicrobial activity. Enhanced Na<sup>+</sup>-driven MΦ function requires the osmoprotective transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), which augments nitric oxide (NO) production and contributes to increased autophagy. However, the mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup> sensing in MΦs remained unclear. High extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> levels (high salt [HS]) trigger a substantial Na<sup>+</sup> influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss. Here, we show that the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger 1 (NCX1, also known as solute carrier family 8 member A1 [SLC8A1]) plays a critical role in HS-triggered Na<sup>+</sup> influx, concomitant Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux, and subsequent augmented NFAT5 accumulation. Moreover, interfering with NCX1 activity impairs HS-boosted inflammatory signaling, infection-triggered autolysosome formation, and subsequent antibacterial activity. Taken together, this demonstrates that NCX1 is able to sense Na<sup>+</sup> and is required for amplifying inflammatory and antimicrobial MΦ responses upon HS exposure. Manipulating NCX1 offers a new strategy to regulate MΦ function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ksxyTGdBMK8" width="1" />

Recent studies have demonstrated prominent and widespread movement-related signals in the brain of head-fixed mice, even in primary sensory areas. However, it is still unknown what role these signals play in sensory processing. Why are these sensory areas ‘contaminated’ by movement signals? During natural behavior, animals actively acquire sensory information as they move through the environment and use this information to guide ongoing actions. In this context, movement-related signals could allow sensory systems to predict self-induced sensory changes and extract additional information about the environment.

<p>by Alexey Savelyev, Gary E. Gorbet, Amy Henrickson, Borries Demeler</p>

Recent advances in instrumentation have moved analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) closer to a possible validation in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) environment. In order for AUC to be validated for a GMP environment, stringent requirements need to be satisfied; analysis procedures must be evaluated for consistency and reproducibility, and GMP capable data acquisition software needs to be developed and validated. These requirements extend to multiple regulatory aspects, covering documentation of instrument hardware functionality, data handling and software for data acquisition and data analysis, process control, audit trails and automation. Here we review the requirements for GMP validation of data acquisition software and illustrate software solutions based on UltraScan that address these requirements as far as they relate to the operation and data handling in conjunction with the latest analytical ultracentrifuge, the Optima AUC by Beckman Coulter. The software targets the needs of regulatory agencies, where AUC plays a critical role in the solutionbased characterization of biopolymers and macromolecular assemblies. Biopharmaceutical and regulatory agencies rely heavily on this technique for characterizations of pharmaceutical formulations, biosimilars, injectables, nanoparticles, and other soluble therapeutics. Because of its resolving power, AUC is a favorite application, despite the current lack of GMP validation. We believe that recent advances in standards, hardware, and software presented in this work manage to bridge this gap and allow AUC to be routinely used in a GMP environment. AUC has great potential to provide more detailed information, at higher resolution, and with greater confidence than other analytical techniques, and our software satisfies an urgent need for AUC operation in the GMP environment. The software, including documentation, are publicly available for free download from Github. The multi-platform software is licensed by the LGPL v.3 open source license and supports Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.

A high quality benchmark for small variants encompassing 88 to 90% of the reference genome has been developed for seven Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference samples. However a reliable benchmark for large indels and structural variants (SVs) is more challenging. In this study, we manually curated 1235 SVs, which can ultimately be used to evaluate SV callers or train machine learning models. We developed a crowdsourcing app—SVCurator—to help GIAB curators manually review large indels and SVs within the human genome, and report their genotype and size accuracy. SVCurator displays images from short, long, and linked read sequencing data from the GIAB Ashkenazi Jewish Trio son [NIST RM 8391/HG002]. We asked curators to assign labels describing SV type (deletion or insertion), size accuracy, and genotype for 1235 putative insertions and deletions sampled from different size bins between 20 and 892,149 bp. ‘Expert’ curators were 93% concordant with each other, and 37 of the 61 curators had at least 78% concordance with a set of ‘expert’ curators. The curators were least concordant for complex SVs and SVs that had inaccurate breakpoints or size predictions. After filtering events with low concordance among curators, we produced high confidence labels for 935 events. The SVCurator crowdsourced labels were 94.5% concordant with the heuristic-based draft benchmark SV callset from GIAB. We found that curators can successfully evaluate putative SVs when given evidence from multiple sequencing technologies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yYwFuZlsBC4" width="1" />

<p>by Fatemeh Khatami, Monty A. Escabí</p>

The auditory neural code is resilient to acoustic variability and capable of recognizing sounds amongst competing sound sources, yet, the transformations enabling noise robust abilities are largely unknown. We report that a hierarchical spiking neural network (HSNN) optimized to maximize word recognition accuracy in noise and multiple talkers predicts organizational hierarchy of the ascending auditory pathway. Comparisons with data from auditory nerve, midbrain, thalamus and cortex reveals that the optimal HSSN predicts several transformations of the ascending auditory pathway including a sequential loss of temporal resolution and synchronization ability, increasing sparseness, and selectivity. The optimal organizational scheme enhances performance by selectively filtering out noise and fast temporal cues such as voicing periodicity, that are not directly relevant to the word recognition task. An identical network arranged to enable high information transfer fails to predict auditory pathway organization and has substantially poorer performance. Furthermore, conventional single-layer linear and nonlinear receptive field networks that capture the overall feature extraction of the HSNN fail to achieve similar performance. The findings suggest that the auditory pathway hierarchy and its sequential nonlinear feature extraction computations enhance relevant cues while removing non-informative sources of noise, thus enhancing the representation of sounds in noise impoverished conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DD252m6Ocbo" width="1" />

<p>by Manfeng Zhang, Huigang Shi, Xuemei Zhang, Xinzheng Zhang, Yihua Huang</p>

Curli play critical roles in biofilm formation, host cell adhesion, and colonization of inert surfaces in many Enterobacteriaceae. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, curli biogenesis requires 7 curli-specific gene (<i>csg</i>) products—CsgA through G—working in concert. Of them, CsgG and CsgF are 2 outer membrane (OM)-localized components that consists of the core apparatus for secretion and assembly of curli structural subunits, CsgB and CsgA. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of CsgG in complex with CsgF from <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. The structure reveals that CsgF forms a stable complex with CsgG via a 1:1 stoichiometry by lining the upper lumen of the nonameric CsgG channel via its N-terminal 27 residues, forming a funnel-like entity plugged in the CsgG channel and creating a unique secretion channel with 2 constriction regions, consistent with the recently reported structure of the CsgG-CsgF complex. Functional studies indicate that export of CsgF to the cell surface requires the CsgG channel, and CsgF not only functions as an adaptor that bridges CsgB with CsgG but also may play important roles in controlling the rates of translocation and/or polymerization for curli structural subunits. Importantly, we found that a series of CsgF-derived peptides are able to efficiently inhibit curli production to <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> when administrated exogenously, highlighting a potential strategy to interfere biofilm formation in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RmDTSjyQvcY" width="1" />

<p>by Catalina Valdés-Baizabal, Guillermo V. Carbajal, David Pérez-González, Manuel S. Malmierca</p>

Dopamine guides behavior and learning through pleasure, according to classic understanding. Dopaminergic neurons are traditionally thought to signal positive or negative prediction errors (PEs) when reward expectations are, respectively, exceeded or not matched. These signed PEs are quite different from the unsigned PEs, which report surprise during sensory processing. But mounting theoretical accounts from the predictive processing framework postulate that dopamine, as a neuromodulator, could potentially regulate the postsynaptic gain of sensory neurons, thereby scaling unsigned PEs according to their expected precision or confidence. Despite ample modeling work, the physiological effects of dopamine on the processing of surprising sensory information are yet to be addressed experimentally. In this study, we tested how dopamine modulates midbrain processing of unexpected tones. We recorded extracellular responses from the rat inferior colliculus to oddball and cascade sequences, before, during, and after the microiontophoretic application of dopamine or eticlopride (a D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor antagonist). Results demonstrate that dopamine reduces the net neuronal responsiveness exclusively to unexpected sensory input without significantly altering the processing of expected input. We conclude that dopaminergic projections from the thalamic subparafascicular nucleus to the inferior colliculus could encode the expected precision of unsigned PEs, attenuating via D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors the postsynaptic gain of sensory inputs forwarded by the auditory midbrain neurons. This direct dopaminergic modulation of sensory PE signaling has profound implications for both the predictive coding framework and the understanding of dopamine function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JHDPF6zB2SM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Generating neurons from human stem cells has potential for brain damage therapy and neurogenesis modeling, but current efficacy is limited by culture heterogeneity and the lack of markers. We have previously reported the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) as the markers of lineage‐specific human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and mediators of hNSC lineage potential. Here, we further examined phenotypical characteristics and GPC1 and GPC4 during neural differentiation of hNSCs in the presence of two neurogenic growth factors reported to bind to heparan sulfate: brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). In hNSC neural cultures, GPC1 and GPC4 were expressed along neurites and cell bodies in long‐term (40–60 days) neural differentiation cultures demonstrating the areas of differential localization—suggesting potentially different functions. Neural differentiation cultures in the presence of BDNF or PDGF‐B generated phenotypically different neural cells with BDNF treatment associated with higher <i>GPC4 </i> versus <i>GPC1 </i> expression, increased heterogeneity, and differential neuron subtype marker expression to PDGF‐B cultures. PDGF‐B cultures exhibited higher levels of spontaneous activity and reduced heterogeneity over long‐term culture associated with decreased <i>GPC4 </i>. Untreated neural cultures were highly variable, supporting the use of neuroregulatory growth factors for guided differentiation. Targeted siRNA downregulation of GPC1/4 reduced neural differentiation markers and altered response to exogenous BDNF and PDGF‐B. This work confirms GPC1 and GPC4 as regulators of human neural differentiation and supports their use as novel markers of neural cell characterization.</p>

<p>Phase synchronization measures are widely used for investigating inter-regional functional connectivity (FC) of brain oscillations, but which phase synchronization measure should be chosen for a given experiment remains unclear. Using neuromagnetic brain signals recorded from healthy participants during somatosensory stimuli, we compared the performance of four phase synchronization measures, imaginary part of phase-locking value, imaginary part of coherency (ImCoh), phase lag index and weighted phase lag index (wPLI), for detecting stimulus-induced FCs between the contralateral primary and ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortices. The analyses revealed that ImCoh exhibited the best performance for detecting stimulus-induced FCs, followed by the wPLI. We found that amplitude weighting, which is related to computing both ImCoh and wPLI, effectively attenuated the influence of noise contamination. A simulation study modeling noise-contaminated periodograms replicated these findings. The present results suggest that the amplitude-dependent measures, ImCoh followed by wPLI, may have the advantage in detecting stimulus-induced FCs.</p>

<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique able to modulate cortical excitability. This modulation may influence areas and networks responsible for specific cognitive processes, and the repetition of the induced temporary changes can produce long-lasting effects. TMS effectiveness may be enhanced when used in conjunction with cognitive training focused on specific cognitive functions. Playing video games can be an optimal cognitive training since it involves different cognitive components and high levels of engagement and motivation. The goal of this study is to assess the synergistic effects of TMS and video game training to enhance cognition, specifically, working memory and executive functions. We conducted a randomized 2 × 3 repeated measures (stimulation × time) study, randomly assigning 27 healthy volunteers to an active intermittent theta-burst stimulation or a sham stimulation group. Participants were assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery before, immediately after, and 15 days after finishing the video game+TMS training. The training consisted of 10 sessions where participants played a 3D platform video game for 1.5 h. After each gaming session, TMS was applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All participants improved their video gaming performance, but we did not find a synergistic effect of stimulation and video game training. Neither had we found cognitive improvements related to the stimulation. We explored possible confounding variables such as age, gender, and early video gaming experience through linear regression. The early video gaming experience was related to improvements in working memory and inhibitory control. This result, although exploratory, highlights the influence of individual variables and previous experiences on brain plasticity.</p>

<p>Neuroscientists are fond of talking about brain systems for the processing of “what” and “where” information about objects and their locations. What is critically missing is the concept of a “who” system dedicated to the neural processing of information about social agents—both the self and others—and their interactions. I propose here the characterization of such a system, one that functions not only in perception but in production as well, such as when recounting stories about oneself and others. The most human-specific features of the “who” system are two complementary systems that I refer to as the other-as-self mechanism and the self-as-other mechanism. The major function of the other-as-self mechanism is to perceive other people egocentrically as proxies of the self, as occurs through the processes of mentalizing and empathizing in both everyday life and in the experience of the theatrical and literary arts. The major function of the self-as-other mechanism is to overtly depict other people during acts of communication through vocal and gestural processes of mimicry, such as occurs during quotation in conversation and through acting in the theatrical arts. Overall, the “who” system of the human brain mediates both perceptual and behavioral aspects of social cognition, and establishes the existential distinction between self and other in human cognition. I present neural models for the instantiation of the “who” system in the human brain and conclude with a discussion of how narrative serves as a foundation for human cognition more generally, what I refer to as narrative-based cognition.</p>

<p>Pain is one of the most significant causes of suffering and disability world-wide, and arguably the most burdensome global health challenge. The growing number of patients suffering from chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, migraine and irritable bowel syndrome, not only reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of pain types, but also our lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have emerged as viable targets for effective chronic pain therapy. However, DRG’s contain different classes of primary sensory neurons including pain-associated nociceptive neurons, non-nociceptive temperature sensing, mechanosensory and chemoreceptive neurons, as well as multiple types of immune and endothelial cells. This cell-population heterogeneity makes investigations of individual subgroups of DRG neurons, such as nociceptors, difficult. In attempts to overcome some of these difficulties, a limited number of immortalized DRG-derived cell lines have been generated over the past few decades. In vitro experiments using DRG-derived cell lines have been useful in understanding sensory neuron function. In addition to retaining phenotypic similarities to primary cultured DRG neurons, these cells offer greater suitability for high throughput assays due to ease of culture, maintenance, growth efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For accurate interpretation and translation of results it is critical, however, that phenotypic similarities and differences of DRG-derived cells lines are methodically compared to native neurons. Published reports to date show notable variability in how these DRG-derived cells are maintained and differentiated. Understanding the cellular and molecular differences stemming from different culture methods, is essential to validate past and future experiments, and enable these cells to be used to their full potential. This review describes currently available DRG-derived cell lines, their known sensory and nociceptor specific molecular profiles, and summarize their morphological features related to differentiation and neurite outgrowth.</p>

<p>Exercise may be the most commonly offered yet least consistently followed therapeutic advice for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Epidemiological studies of prospectively followed cohorts have shown a lower risk for later developing PD in healthy people who report moderate to high levels of physical activity, and slower rates of motor and non-motor symptom progression in people with PD who report higher baseline physical activity. In animal models of PD, exercise can reduce inflammation, decrease α-synuclein expression, reduce mitochondrial dysfunction, and increase neurotrophic growth factor expression. Randomized controlled trials of exercise in PD have provided clear evidence for short-term benefits on many PD measurements scales, ranging from disease severity to quality of life. In this review, we present these convergent epidemiological and laboratory data with particular attention to translationally relevant features of exercise (e.g., intensity requirements, gender differences, and associated biomarkers). In the context of these findings we will discuss clinical trial experience, design challenges, and emerging opportunities for determining whether exercise can prevent PD or slow its long-term progression.</p>

Both the PL and BLA regulate emotional behaviors and have similar extrinsic connectivity. However, it is unclear whether they encode distinct aspects of emotional events. Kyriazi et al. show that neurons in these structures encode similar emotional variables but at the population level tend to represent different task dimensions.

SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and production of infectious de-novo virus particles.

<p>by Özge Z. Aydin, Sevket Onur Taflan, Can Gurkaslar, Elif Nur Firat-Karalar</p>

Centriolar satellites are dynamic, membraneless granules composed of over 200 proteins. They store, modify, and traffic centrosome and primary cilium proteins, and help to regulate both the biogenesis and some functions of centrosomes and cilium. In most cell types, satellites cluster around the perinuclear centrosome, but their integrity and cellular distribution are dynamically remodeled in response to different stimuli, such as cell cycle cues. Dissecting the specific and temporal functions and mechanisms of satellites and how these are influenced by their cellular positioning and dynamics has been challenging using genetic approaches, particularly in ciliated and proliferating cells. To address this, we developed a chemical-based trafficking assay to rapidly and efficiently redistribute satellites to either the cell periphery or center, and fuse them into stable clusters in a temporally controlled way. Induced satellite clustering at either the periphery or center resulted in antagonistic changes in the pericentrosomal levels of a subset of proteins, revealing a direct and selective role for their positioning in protein targeting and sequestration. Systematic analysis of the interactome of peripheral satellite clusters revealed enrichment of proteins implicated in cilium biogenesis and mitosis. Importantly, induction of peripheral satellite targeting in ciliated cells revealed a function for satellites not just for efficient cilium assembly but also in the maintenance of steady-state cilia and in cilia disassembly by regulating the structural integrity of the ciliary axoneme. Finally, perturbing satellite distribution and dynamics inhibited their mitotic dissolution, and mitotic progression was perturbed only in cells with centrosomal satellite clustering. Collectively, our results for the first time showed a direct link between satellite functions and their pericentrosomal clustering, suggested new mechanisms underlying satellite functions during cilium assembly, and provided a new tool for probing temporal satellite functions in different contexts<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/as_vmQeA6ks" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dynamic of the temporal correlations between brain areas, called functional connectivity (FC), undergoes complex transformations through the life span. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of these changes in the nonpathological brain from fetal life to advanced age. After a brief description of the main methods, we propose that FC development can be divided into four main phases: first, before birth, a strong change in FC leads to the emergence of functional proto‐networks, involving mainly within network short‐range connections. Then, during the first years of life, there is a strong widespread organization of networks which starts with segregation processes followed by a continuous increase in integration. Thereafter, from adolescence to early adulthood, a refinement of existing networks in the brain occurs, characterized by an increase in integrative processes until about 40 years. Middle age constitutes a pivotal period associated with an inversion of the functional brain trajectories with a decrease in segregation process in conjunction to a large‐scale reorganization of between network connections. Studies suggest that these processes are in line with the development of cognitive and sensory functions throughout life as well as their deterioration. During aging, results support the notion of dedifferentiation processes, which refer to the decrease in functional selectivity of the brain regions, resulting in more diffuse and less specialized FC, associated with the disruption of cognitive functions with age. The inversion of developmental processes during aging is in accordance with the developmental models of neuroanatomy for which the latest matured regions are the first to deteriorate.</p>

<p>The regenerative capacity of the zebrafish, and the stereotypic organization of its retinal cell populations, enable examination of the specificity by which retinal Müller glial cells replace neurons that are lost. Zebrafish have four cone types, with peak sensitivities to red, green, blue, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a targeted cell ablation approach, we found that Müller glia produced cones of all types when all cones, red cones and UV cones were ablated. In contrast, blue cone ablation largely failed to generate cones. The relative proportions of regenerated cells of each type depended on the cone types that were ablated, and was biased toward the major cone type that was lost.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue, or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon nondiscriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of nonablated controls, that is, red &gt; green &gt; UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.</p>

<p>Myelin structure is altered in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing a pathological variant of the human amyloid precursor protein (<i>APP<sup>SwInd</sup>) </i>. <i>APP </i> mice have longer paranodes, thicker myelin, and shorter nodes of Ranvier than wildtype mice by 3 months of age, however, total axon density and the proportion of axons that were myelinated was normal. Between 4 and 6 months of age, <i>APP </i> mice have more new oligodendrocytes added to the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria, while total oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell density remained stable, suggesting that new oligodendrocytes may be produced to replace oligodendrocytes lost due to amyloid pathology.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaque formation is associated with the focal death of oligodendrocytes and soluble amyloid β impairs the survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to early amyloid pathology remains unclear. To explore this, we performed a histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral characterization of transgenic mice expressing a pathological form of human <i>amyloid precursor protein </i> (<i>APP </i>), containing three single point mutations associated with the development of familial Alzheimer's disease (<i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> 
</i>, also known as J20 mice). <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> 
</i> transgenic mice had impaired survival from weaning, were hyperactive by 2 months of age, and developed amyloid plaques by 6 months of age, however, their spatial memory remained intact over this time course. Hippocampal OPC density was normal in P60‐P180 <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> 
</i> transgenic mice and, by performing whole‐cell patch‐clamp electrophysiology, we found that their membrane properties, including their response to kainate (100 µM), were largely normal. However, by P100, the response of hippocampal OPCs to GABA was elevated in <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> 
</i> transgenic mice. We also found that the nodes of Ranvier were shorter, the paranodes longer, and the myelin thicker for hippocampal axons in young adult <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> 
</i> transgenic mice compared with wildtype littermates. Additionally, oligodendrogenesis was normal in young adulthood, but increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria of <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> 
</i> transgenic mice as pathology developed. As the new oligodendrocytes were not associated with a change in total oligodendrocyte number, these cells are likely required for cell replacement.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses <i>LacZ </i> under the control of an intragenic enhancer of <i>Dlx5 </i> and <i>Dlx6 </i> (<i>Dlx5 </i>/<i>6‐LacZ </i>). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including <i>Calb2 </i> and <i>Nkx2.2 </i> ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has long been known that age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is more common, more severe, and with an earlier onset in men compared to women. Even in the absence of confounding factors such as noise exposure, these sexdifferences in susceptibility to ARHL remain. In the last decade, insight into the pleiotrophic nature by which estrogen signaling can impact multiple signaling mechanisms to mediate downstream changes in gene expression and/or elicit rapid changes in cellular function has rapidly gathered pace, and a role for estrogen signaling in the biological pathways that confer neuroprotection is becoming undeniable. Here I review the evidence why we need to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) when investigating the etiology of ARHL. Loss of auditory function with aging is frequency‐specific and modulated by SABV. Evidence also suggests that differences in cochlear physiology between women and men are already present from birth. Understanding the molecular basis of these sex differences in ARHL will accelerate the development of precision medicine therapies for ARHL.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke that could cause hemorrhagic complications. We aimed to evaluate the pathology of MT‐induced arterial damage and neurovascular unit (NVU) disruption in relation to tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) injection for acute ischemic stroke. We induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male SHR/Izm rats for 2 hr. This was followed by reperfusion with/without tPA (3 mg/kg) and “rough suture” insertion that mimicked MT once or thrice (MT1 or MT3). Compared with the control group, the tPA + MT3 group presented with an increase in the cerebral infarct and hemorrhage with severer IgG leakage. Moreover, structural damage reaching the tunica media was detected in the MT3 and tPA + MT3 groups. The tPA + MT3 group presented with increased matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression with some MMP9‐positive cells expressing a neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase. Furthermore, basal lamina detachment from astrocyte foot processes was observed in the tPA + MT1 and tPA + MT3 groups. These findings suggest that MT causes direct arterial damage, as well as VEGF and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, especially when combined with tPA.</p>

<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder in which children present prefrontal cortex (PFC) related functions deficit. Proactive cognitive control is a process that anticipates the requirement of cognitive control and crucially depends on the maturity of the PFC. Since this process is important to ADHD symptomatology, we here test the hypothesis that children with ADHD have proactive cognitive control impairments and that these impairments are reflected in the PFC oscillatory activity. We recorded EEG signals from 29 male children with ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) male children while they performed a Go-Nogo task, where the likelihood of a Nogo stimulus increased while a sequence of consecutive Go stimuli elapsed. TD children showed proactive cognitive control by increasing their reaction time (RT) concerning the number of preceding Go stimuli, whereas children with ADHD did not. This adaptation was related to modulations in both P3a potential and lateral prefrontal theta oscillation for TD children. Children with ADHD as a group did not demonstrate either P3a or theta modulation. But, individual variation in theta activity was correlated with the ADHD symptomatology. The results depict a neurobiological mechanism of proactive cognitive control impairments in children with ADHD.</p>

<p>Functional diversification along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is a rapidly growing concept. Modulation of synaptic transmission by neurotransmitter receptors may importantly contribute to specialization of local intrinsic network function along the hippocampus. In the present study, using transverse slices from the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus of adult rats and recordings of evoked field postsynaptic excitatory potentials (fEPSPs) from the CA1 stratum radiatum, we aimed to compare modulation of synaptic transmission between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus. We found that transient heterosynaptic depression (tHSD, &lt;2 s), a physiologically relevant phenomenon of regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission induced by paired stimulation of two independent inputs to stratum radiatum of CA1 field, has an increased magnitude and duration in the ventral hippocampus, presumably contributing to increased input segregation in this segment of the hippocampus. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, adenosine A1 receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels appear to contribute differently to tHSD in the two hippocampal segments; GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs play a predominant role in the ventral hippocampus while both GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and A1Rs play important roles in the dorsal hippocampus. Activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors by an exogenous agonist, baclofen, robustly and reversibly modulated both the initial fast and the late slow components of excitatory synaptic transmission, expressed by the fEPSPslope and fEPSP decay time constant (fEPSP<sub>τ</sub>), respectively. Specifically, baclofen suppressed fEPSP slope more in the ventral than in the dorsal hippocampus and enhanced fEPSP<sub>τ</sub> more in the dorsal than in the ventral hippocampus. Also, baclofen enhanced paired-pulse facilitation in the two hippocampal segments similarly. Blockade of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors did not affect basal paired-pulse facilitation in either hippocampal segment. We propose that the revealed dorsal-ventral differences in modulation of synaptic transmission may provide a means for specialization of information processing in the local neuronal circuits, thereby significantly contributing to diversifying neuronal network functioning along the dorsal-ventral axis of hippocampus.</p>

<p>Acute central nervous system (CNS) disease is very common and with high mortality. Many basic studies have confirmed the molecular mechanism of early brain injury (EBI) after acute CNS disease. Neuron death and dysfunction are important reasons for the neurological dysfunction in patients with acute CNS disease. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death, the classical characteristic of which is based on the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid reactive oxygen species. Previous studies have indicated that this mechanism is critical in the cell death events observed in many diseases, including cancer, tumor resistance, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Ferroptosis may also play a very important role in EBI after acute CNS disease. Unresolved issues include the relationship between ferroptosis and other forms of cell death after acute CNS disease, the specific molecular mechanisms of EBI, the strategies to activate or inhibit ferroptosis to achieve desirable attenuation of EBI, and the need to find new molecular markers of ferroptosis that can be used to detect and study this process in vivo after acute CNS disease.</p>

<p>Shortage of oxygen and nutrients in the brain induces the release of glutamate and ATP that can cause excitotoxicity and contribute to neuronal and glial damage. Our understanding of the mechanisms of ATP release and toxicity in cerebrovascular diseases is incomplete. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge about the participation of key elements in the ATP-mediated deleterious effects in these pathologies. This includes pannexin-1 hemichannels, calcium homeostasis modulator-1 (CALHM1), purinergic P2X7 receptors, and other intermediaries of CNS injury downstream of ATP release. Available data together with recent pharmacological developments in purinergic signaling may constitute a new opportunity to translate preclinical findings into more effective therapies in cerebrovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Many studies have documented the role of oxidative stress and angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of PD. Metformin (MTF) is an antidiabetic medication and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulator that has shown antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties in many disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effect of MTF in a mouse model of rotenone-prompted PD with a highlight on its influence on the AMPK/forkhead box transcription factor O3 (FOXO3) pathway and striatal angiogenesis. In the running study, PD was induced in mice using repeated doses of rotenone and concomitantly treated with MTF 100 or 200 mg/kg/day for 18 days. Rotarod and pole tests were used to examine the animals’ motor functionality. After that, animals were sacrificed, and brains were isolated and processed for immunohistochemical investigations or biochemical analyses. Oxidant stress and angiogenic markers were measured, including reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), hemoxygenase-1, thioredoxin, AMPK, FOXO3, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Results indicated that MTF improved animals’ motor function, improved striatal glutathione, Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1, and thioredoxin. Furthermore, MTF upregulated AMPK-FOXO3 proteins and reduced VEGF and cleaved caspase 3. MTF also increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)–stained neurons in the substantia nigra neurons and in striatal neuronal terminals. This study is the first to highlight that the neuroprotective role of MTF is mediated through activation of AMPK-FOXO3 signaling and inhibition of the proangiogenic factor, VEGF. Further studies are warranted to confirm this mechanism in other models of PD and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00614">Microglial Sirtuin 2 Shapes Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal Slices</a></h4>

<p>Microglial cells have emerged as crucial players in synaptic plasticity during development and adulthood, and also in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. Here we found that decreased levels of Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) deacetylase in microglia affects hippocampal synaptic plasticity under inflammatory conditions. The results show that long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude recorded from hippocampal slices of wild type mice does not differ between those exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory stimulus, or BSA. However, LTP recorded from hippocampal slices of microglial-specific Sirt2 deficient (Sirt2<sup>–</sup>) mice was significantly impaired by LPS. Importantly, LTP values were restored by memantine, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These results indicate that microglial Sirt2 prevents NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in hippocampal slices in response to an inflammatory signal such as LPS. Overall, our data suggest a key-protective role for microglial Sirt2 in mnesic deficits associated with neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Improving the clinical translation of animal-based neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) therapies to humans requires an understanding of intrinsic human and animal cell characteristics. We report a novel in vitro method to assess spinal cord NSPCs from a small (rodent) and large (porcine) animal model in comparison to human NSPCs. To extract live adult human, porcine, and rodent spinal cord tissue, we illustrate a strategy using an anterior or posterior approach that was simulated in a porcine model. The initial expansion of primary NSPCs is carried out using the neurosphere assay followed by a pharmacological treatment phase during which NSPCs derived from humans, porcines, and rodents are assessed in parallel using the same defined parameters. Using this model, NSPCs from all species demonstrated multi-lineage differentiation and self-renewal. Importantly, these methods provide conditions to enable the direct comparison of species-dependent cell behavior in response to specific exogenous signals.</p>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with no definite treatment. The expression of miR-29 family is significantly reduced in AD, suggesting a part for the family members in pathogenesis of the disease. The recent emergence of microRNA (miRNA)–based therapeutic approaches is emphasized on the efficiency of miRNA transfer to target cells. The endogenously made secretory vesicles could provide a biological vehicle for drug delivery. Characteristics such as small sizes, the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, the specificity in binding to the right target cells, and most importantly the capacity to be engineered as drug carriers have made exosomes desirable vehicles to deliver genetic materials to the central nervous system. Here, we transfected rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) with recombinant expression vectors, carrying either mir-29a or mir-29b precursor sequences. A significant overexpression of miR-29 and downregulation of their targets genes, BACE1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) and BIM [Bcl−2 interacting mediator of cell death (BCL2-like 11)], were confirmed in the transfected cells. Then, we confirmed the packaging of miR-29 in exosomes secreted from the transfected cells. Finally, we investigated a possible therapeutic effect of the engineered exosomes to reduce the pathological effects of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in a rat model of AD. Aβ–treated model rats showed some deficits in spatial learning and memory. However, in animals injected with miR-29–containing exosomes at CA1 (cornu ammonis area), the aforementioned impairments were prevented. In conclusion, our findings provide a new approach for the packaging of miR-29 in exosomes and that the engineered exosomes might have a therapeutic potential in AD.</p>

<p>Deep learning methods have shown their great capability of extracting high-level features from image and have been used for effective medical imaging classification recently. However, training samples of medical images are restricted by the amount of patients as well as medical ethics issues, making it hard to train the neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end three-dimensional (3D) attention-based residual neural network (ResNet) architecture to classify different subtypes of subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) with single-shot T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. Our aim is to develop a convolutional neural network to provide a convenient and effective way to assist doctors in the diagnosis and early treatment of the different subtypes of SVCI. The experiment data in this paper are collected from 242 patients from the Neurology Department of Renji Hospital, including 78 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), 70 nonamnestic MCI (na-MCI), and 94 no cognitive impairment (NCI). The accuracy of our proposed model has reached 98.6% on a training set and 97.3% on a validation set. The test accuracy on an untrained testing set reaches 93.8% with robustness. Our proposed method can provide a convenient and effective way to assist doctors in the diagnosis and early treatment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00534">Evoking Apparent Moving Sensation in the Hand via Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation</a></h4>

<p>The restoration of sensory feedback in amputees plays a fundamental role in the prosthesis control and in the communication on the afferent channel between hand and brain. The literature shows that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be a promising non-invasive technique to elicit sensory feedback in amputees, especially in the lower limb through the phenomenon of apparent moving sensation (AMS). It consists of delivering a sensation that moves along a specific part of the body. This study proposes to use TENS to elicit tactile sensations and adopt AMS to reproduce moving sensations on the hand, such as those related to an object moving in the hand or slipping upward or downward. To this purpose, the developed experimental protocol consists of two phases: (i) the mapping of the evoked sensations and (ii) the generation of the AMS. In the latter phase, the pulse amplitude variation (PAV), the pulse width variation (PWV), and the interstimulus delay modulation (ISDM) methods were compared. For the comparative analysis, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (P &lt; 0.016) was carried out on the success rate and on the ranking of methods expressed by the subjects. Results from the mapping protocol show that the delivered sensations were mostly described by the subjects as almost natural and superficial tingling. Results from the AMS protocol show that, for each movement direction, the success rate of ISDM method is higher than that of PWV and PAV and significantly higher than that of PAV for the ulnar-median direction. It recreates an AMS in the hand that effectively allows discriminating the type of sensation and distinguishing the movement direction. Moreover, ISDM was ranked by the subjects as the favorite method for recreating a well-defined and comfortable moving sensation only in the median-ulnar direction. For the ranking results, there was not a statistically significant difference among the methods. The experiments confirmed the good potential of recreating an AMS in the hand through TENS. This encourages to push forward this study on amputees and integrate it in the closed-loop control of a prosthetic system, in order to enable full control of grasp stability and prevent the objects from slippage.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00230">Effect of tDCS Over the Right Inferior Parietal Lobule on Mind-Wandering Propensity</a></h4>

<p>Mind-wandering is associated with switching our attention to internally directed thoughts and is by definition an intrinsic, self-generated cognitive function. Interestingly, previous research showed that it may be possible to modulate its propensity externally, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting different regions in the default mode and executive control networks (ECNs). However, these studies used highly heterogeneous montages (targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), or both concurrently), often showed contradicting results, and in many cases failed to replicate. Our study aimed to establish whether tDCS of the default mode network (DMN), via targeting the right IPL alone, could modulate mind-wandering propensity using a within-subjects double-blind, counterbalanced design. Participants completed sustained attention to response task (SART) interspersed with thought-probes to capture their subjective reports of mind-wandering before and after receiving anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the right IPL (with the reference over the left cheek). We found evidence for the lack of an effect of stimulation on subjective reports of mind-wandering (JZS-BF<sub>01</sub> = 5.19), as well as on performance on the SART task (errors (JZS-BF<sub>01</sub> = 6.79) and reaction time (JZS-BF<sub>01</sub> = 5.94). Overall, we failed to replicate previous reports of successful modulations of mind-wandering propensity with tDCS over the IPL, instead of providing evidence in support of the lack of an effect. This and other recent unsuccessful replications call into question whether it is indeed possible to externally modulate spontaneous or self-generated cognitive processes.</p>

<p>The mammillary body (MB) has been thought to implement mnemonic functions. Although recent animal studies have revealed dissociable roles of the lateral and medial parts of the MB, the dissociable roles of the lateral/medial MB in the human brain is still unclear. Functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively inspect the intricate functional organization of the human MB with a high degree of spatial resolution. The present study divided the human MB into lateral and medial parts and examined their functional connectivity with the hippocampal formation, tegmental nuclei, and anterior thalamus. The subiculum of the hippocampal formation was more strongly connected with the medial part than with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the pre/parasubiculum was more strongly connected with the lateral part than with the medial part of the MB. The dorsal tegmental nucleus was connected more strongly with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the ventral tegmental nucleus showed an opposite pattern. The anterior thalamus was connected more strongly with the medial part of the MB. These results confirm the extant animal literature on the lateral/medial MB and provide evidence on the parallel but dissociable systems involving the MB that ascribe mnemonic and spatial-navigation functions to the medial and lateral MBs, respectively.</p>

<p>Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. Modulating vagal activity via electrical stimulation (VNS) in patients and animal studies caused changes in food intake, energy metabolism, and body weight. However, the moderating impact of cognitive processes on VNS effects on eating behavior has not been investigated so far.</p><p>Hypothesis: We hypothesized that transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) affects food intake by altering cognitive functions relevant to the processing of food-related information.</p><p>Methods: Using a repeated-measurement design, we applied tVNS and a sham stimulation for 2 h on two different days in normal-weight subjects. We recorded standard scalp EEG while subjects watched food and object pictures presented in an oddball task. We analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) P1, P2, N2, and LPP and also examined the amount of consumed food and eating duration in a free-choice test meal.</p><p>Results: Significant differences between stimulations were observed for the P1, P2, and N2 amplitudes. However, we found no tVNS-dependent modulation of food intake nor a specific food-related stimulation effect on the ERPs. Further analyses revealed a negative relationship between P2 amplitude and food intake for the sham stimulation. Significant effects are additionally confirmed by Bayesian statistics.</p><p>Conclusion: Our study demonstrates tVNS’ impact on visual processing. Since the effects were similar between food and object stimuli, a general effect on visual perceptual processing can be assumed. More detailed investigations of these effects and their relationship with food intake and metabolism seem reasonable for future studies.</p>

<p>The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is involved in odor discrimination, odor-associative multimodal memory, and neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. It receives direct axonal projections from both olfactory bulb (OB) output neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the cellular targets in LEC receiving direct synaptic input from OB output neuron, the functional characteristics of these synapses, and whether or how dopamine (DA) modulates the OB-LEC pathway remain undetermined. We addressed these questions in the present study by combing optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches with four major findings: (1) selective activation of OB input elicited glutamate-mediated monosynaptic responses in all fan cells, the major output neurons in layer II of the LEC; (2) this excitatory synaptic transmission exhibited robust paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), a presynaptically derived short-term synaptic plasticity; (3) DA dramatically attenuated the strength of the OB input-fan cell synaptic transmission via activation of D1 receptors; and (4) DA altered the PPF of this transmission but neither intrinsic properties of postsynaptic neurons nor the kinetic profile of postsynaptic responses, suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms underlie the DA inhibitory actions. This study for the first time demonstrates the FCs in the LEC layer II as the postsynaptic target of direct OB input and characterizes DA modulation of the OB input-fan cell pathway. These findings set the foundation for future studies to examine the synaptic transmission from the OB output neuron axon terminals to other potential cell types in the LEC and to pinpoint the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits associated with DA-relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder in which the striatum is the most affected brain region. Although a chronic inflammatory microglial reaction that amplifies disease progression has been described in HD patients, some murine models develop symptoms without inflammatory microglial activation. Thus, dysfunction of non-inflammatory microglial activity could also contribute to the early HD pathological process. Here, we show the involvement of microglia and particularly fractalkine signaling in the striatal synaptic dysfunction of R6/1 mice. We found reduced fractalkine gene expression and protein concentration in R6/1 striata from 8 to 20 weeks of age. Consistently, we also observed a down-regulation of fractalkine levels in the putamen of HD patients and in HD patient hiPSC-derived neurons. Automated cell morphology analysis showed a non-inflammatory ramified microglia in the striatum of R6/1 mice. However, we found increased PSD-95-positive puncta inside microglia, indicative of synaptic pruning, before HD motor symptoms start to manifest. Indeed, microglia appeared to be essential for striatal synaptic function, as the inhibition of microglial activity with minocycline impaired the induction of corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD) in wild-type mice. Notably, fractalkine administration restored impaired corticostriatal LTD in R6/1 mice. Our results unveil a role for fractalkine-dependent neuron-microglia interactions in the early striatal synaptic dysfunction characteristic of HD.</p>

<p>While the proximal dentatothalamocortical tracts are considered pivotal in the occurrence of cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) after medulloblastoma resection, how the cerebellum participates in motor–speech networks through direct structural connectivity is still unclear. Via tractography, we provide evidence of cerebellar streamlines projecting into the left inferior frontal gyrus majorly connecting Broca’s complex and the bilateral Crus lobes. The streamlines, named Crus–Broca tracts, originated from the bilateral Crus lobes, synapsed onto the dentate nucleus, ascended into the superior cerebellar peduncle (where these streamlines were closely superior to the superior border of the supratonsillar cleft and the superolateral roof of the fourth ventricle), surprisingly bypassed the left red nucleus and the left thalamus, and ended at the subregions of Broca’s complex. The streamlines, named Broca–Crus tracts, originated from the subregions of Broca’s complex and ended predominantly at the right Crus lobes. If verified, the existence of these connections would support the notion of the bilateral cerebellums’ participation in motor–speech planning, and the anatomical relationship of Broca–Crus tracts with the supratonsillar cleft would merit consideration for further studies aimed at further elucidating CMS mechanisms.</p>

<p>Objective: We aimed to determine whether the combination of two parameters: (a) score of axial impairment and limb rigidity (SAILR) with (b) EEG global relative median power in the frequency range theta 4–8 Hz (GRMPT) predicted cognitive outcome in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) better than each of these measures alone.</p><p>Methods: 47 non-demented patients with PD were examined and re-examined after 3 years. At both time-points, the patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological assessment and EEG in eyes-closed resting-state condition. The results of cognitive tests were normalized and individually summarized to obtain a “global cognitive score” (GCS). Change of GCS was used to represent cognitive changes over time. GRMPT and SAILR was used for further analysis. Linear regression models were calculated.</p><p>Results: GRMPT and SAILR independently predicted cognitive change. Combination of GRMPT and SAILR improved the significance of the regression model as compared to using each of these measures alone. GRMPT and SAILR only slightly correlate between each other.</p><p>Conclusion: The combination of axial signs and rigidity with quantitative EEG improves early identification of patients with PD prone to severe cognitive decline. GRMPT and SAILR seem to reflect different disease mechanisms.</p><p>Significance Combination of EEG and axial motor impairment assessment may be a valuable marker in the cognitive prognosis of PD.</p>

Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a unique type of GABAergic interneuron that selectively innervate the axon initial segment (AIS) of excitatory pyramidal neurons; the subcellular domain where action potentials are initiated. The proper genesis and maturation of ChCs is critical for regulating neural ensemble firing in the neocortex throughout development and adulthood. Recently, genetic and molecular studies have shed new light on the complex innerworkings of ChCs in health and disease. This review presents an overview of recent studies on the developmental origins, migratory properties, and morphology of ChCs.

Kumamoto et al. introduce iOn, a genetic switch that conditions exogenous transgene expression to integration in the host cell genome by DNA transposition. This system radically simplifies stable transgenesis with one or multiple plasmid vectors, opening new options to genetically manipulate cells in cultured systems and model organisms.

<p>by Mario J. C. Ayala, Daniel A. M. Villela</p>

The spread of drug resistance of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> parasites is a challenge towards malaria elimination. <i>P. falciparum</i> has shown an early and severe drug resistance in comparison to <i>P. vivax</i> in various countries. In fact, <i>P. vivax</i> differs in its life cycle and treatment in various factors: development and duration of sexual parasite forms differ, symptoms severity are unequal, relapses present only in <i>P. vivax</i> cases and the Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is only mandatory in <i>P. falciparum</i> cases. We compared the spread of drug resistance for both species through two compartmental models using ordinary differential equations. The model structure describes how sensitive and resistant parasite strains infect a human population treated with antimalarials. We found that an early transmission,i.e., before treatment and low effectiveness of drug coverage, supports the prevalence of sensitive parasites delaying the emergence of resistant <i>P. vivax</i>. These results imply that earlier attention of both symptomatic cases and reservoirs of <i>P. vivax</i> are essential in controlling transmission but also accelerate the spread of drug resistance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HBlonqsj4cI" width="1" />

<p>by Ian Leifer, Flaviano Morone, Saulo D. S. Reis, José S. Andrade Jr., Mariano Sigman, Hernán A. Makse</p>

We show that logic computational circuits in gene regulatory networks arise from a fibration symmetry breaking in the network structure. From this idea we implement a constructive procedure that reveals a hierarchy of genetic circuits, ubiquitous across species, that are surprising analogues to the emblematic circuits of solid-state electronics: starting from the transistor and progressing to ring oscillators, current-mirror circuits to toggle switches and flip-flops. These canonical variants serve fundamental operations of synchronization and clocks (in their symmetric states) and memory storage (in their broken symmetry states). These conclusions introduce a theoretically principled strategy to search for computational building blocks in biological networks, and present a systematic route to design synthetic biological circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1KEJ3Quw1fY" width="1" />
