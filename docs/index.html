     alt="Lifespan of mature olfactory sensory neurons varies with location in the mouse olfactory epithelium and age of the animal"/>
<p>A genetic model based on the expression of an OMP-tTA transgene has been used for assessing survival of mature olfactory sensory neurons as a function of age of the animal and region of the olfactory epithelium (OE). A near-majority and a majority of mature neurons at 2 months and 4.5 months of age, respectively, live for more than 6 months demonstrating substantial stability of this sensory epithelium. However, the lifespan differs between dorsal and ventral epithelium. The diagram summarizes the relationship between mature neuron survival and rate of basal cell proliferation in dorsal vs. ventral OE.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium (OE) exhibit a remarkable regenerative capability, which protects the population against environmental insult and enables adjustment to new odors. The lifespan of OSNs is still open to question, with estimates ranging from 1 month to at least 1 year. However, the estimates come with some caveats, including low labeling efficiency and a focus solely on newborn neurons. We revisited the issue via the use of OMP-tTA; TetO-Cre; Rosa26-fl(stop)-Tdtomato (OMP-tTA;TdT) mice, which allowed us to selectively label ∼95% of the OMP(+) OSN population that reach maturity by a given time and, by switching to doxycycline chow, to “chase” this preexisting OSN population. Two loading protocols were used: conception to 2 months old and conception to 4.5 months old. Surviving OSNs were common up to 6 months chase time in both groups, but more neurons survived when loading for 4.5 months as compared with 2 months. A spatial difference was evident: higher percentages of OSNs survived in the dorsomedial OE as compared with ventrolateral and in posterior versus anterior OE regions. Finally, proliferation rates anticorrelated with the spatial differences in OSN survival; higher proliferation rates were observed ventrally. Together, these results demonstrate spatial and temporal differences in OSN survival, highlighting it as a dynamic system that can be studied for factors affecting neuronal survival.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies several forms of retinal disease including glaucomatous optic neuropathy, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several rare genetic disorders associated with cilia dysfunction have retinal degeneration as a clinical hallmark. Much of the focus of ciliopathy associated blindness is on the connecting cilium of photoreceptors; however, RGCs also possess primary cilia. It is unclear what roles RGC cilia play, what proteins and signaling machinery localize to RGC cilia, or how RGC cilia are differentiated across the subtypes of RGCs. To better understand these questions, we assessed the presence or absence of a prototypical cilia marker Arl13b and a widely distributed neuronal cilia marker AC3 in different subtypes of mouse RGCs. Interestingly, not all RGC subtype cilia are the same and there are significant differences even among these standard cilia markers. Alpha-RGCs positive for osteopontin, calretinin, and SMI32 primarily possess AC3-positive cilia. Directionally selective RGCs that are CART positive or Trhr positive localize either Arl13b or AC3, respectively, in cilia. Intrinsically photosensitive RGCs differentially localize Arl13b and AC3 based on melanopsin expression. Taken together, we characterized the localization of gold standard cilia markers in different subtypes of RGCs and conclude that cilia within RGC subtypes may be differentially organized. Future studies aimed at understanding RGC cilia function will require a fundamental ability to observe the cilia across subtypes as their signaling protein composition is elucidated. A comprehensive understanding of RGC cilia may reveal opportunities to understanding how their dysfunction leads to retinal degeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Florida manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus latirostris</i>) and rock hyraxes (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) exhibit expanded tactile arrays of vibrissae that are distributed not only on the face but also on the entire postfacial body. In contrast, the vibrissae of most mammals are principally restricted to the face. These facial vibrissae may be associated with central nervous system representations known as barrels in the cerebral cortex, barreloids in the thalamus, and barrelettes in the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. To date, vibrissae representations found within the brainstem have been principally limited to facial vibrissae representations in the trigeminal nuclei. We hypothesized that the tactile specializations of the manatee and rock hyrax would produce a unique modification of typical mammalian central nervous system organization, with postfacial vibrissae representations appearing in the cuneate and gracile nuclei as “body barrelettes.” Using histological and histochemical methods, including cresyl violet, myelin, and cytochrome oxidase processing, we first delineated the rostral, middle, and caudal zones of the cuneate and gracile nuclei. Within the middle zone, divisions were present, including extensive parcellation in the cluster region, particularly in manatees. These clusters were particularly densely distributed and distinguishable in the presumptive postfacial body representations in the cuneate and gracile nuclei but otherwise shared many attributes with the barrelettes found in the trigeminal nuclei of other species. This study represents the first characterization of postfacial body vibrissae representations, or “body barrelettes,” in the brainstem of any species. Previous studies have predominantly focused on facial vibrissae representations, which have served for decades as a model for sensory organization and plasticity. Our results extend what is known about vibrissae representations in the central nervous system to include expansions related to peripheral specializations of the postfacial body. Unusual somatosensory adaptations in the manatee and rock hyrax are highly informative regarding how mammalian brain organization responds to evolutionary pressures on sensory systems.</p>

     alt="Childhood trauma exposure and reward processing in healthy adults: A functional neuroimaging study"/>
<p>Childhood abuse was associated with increased ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and income. Overall childhood trauma and childhood neglect were not associated with significant activation changes in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation or the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The association between childhood trauma exposure and risk of developing psychopathology may in part be mediated by the effects of chronic stress on dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, little is known about the differential effects of distinct trauma types on reward processing, particularly in adults without concurrent medical or psychiatric disorders. We examined the association of childhood trauma exposure, including the differential effects of abuse and neglect, with reward processing in healthy adults (<i>n</i> = 114). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was used to assess neural activity in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in relation to reward anticipation and reward outcome, respectively. Exposure to childhood trauma, including abuse and neglect, was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. We found a significant effect for abuse on ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and household monthly income. There were no effects for abuse or neglect, independently or combined, on orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome. Our findings suggest differential effects of childhood abuse on ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation in healthy adults.</p>

	<p>Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a common symptom in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Moreover, many neurological manifestations have been reported in these patients, suggesting central nervous system involvement. The default mode network (DMN) is closely associated with olfactory processing. In this study, we investigated the internetwork and intranetwork connectivity of the DMN and the olfactory network (ON) in 13 healthy controls and 22 patients presenting with COVID-19-related OD using independent component analysis and region of interest functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. There was a significant correlation between the butanol threshold test (BTT) and the intranetwork connectivity in ON. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 patients with OD showed significantly higher intranetwork connectivity in the DMN, as well as higher internetwork connectivity between ON and DMN. However, no significant difference was found between groups in the intranetwork connectivity within ON. We postulate that higher intranetwork functional connectivities compensate for the deficits in olfactory processing and general well-being in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, the compensation process in the ON may not be obvious at this stage. Our results suggest that resting-state fMRI is a potentially valuable tool to evaluate neurosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To investigate the efficacy and safety of an improved ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and nerve block (NB) for patients with pudendal neuralgia (PN). Methods: This retrospective analysis included 88 adults with PN treated in the Pain Department of Southwest Hospital from November 2011 to June 2021, with treatment including NB (n = 40) and PRF (n = 48). The primary outcome variable was pain severity, measured by a standardized visual analog scale (VAS). VAS values were collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days and 1 and 3 months after patients were treated with NB or PRF. Results: Compared with patients treated with NB (n = 40) and those treated with PRF (n = 48), no significant difference in pain reduction was observed in the short term (p = 0.739 and 0.981, at 1 and 3 days, respectively); however, in the medium and long term (1 to 3 months), there were statistically significant improvements in the PRF group over the NB group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, it was noted that the average pain severity of primary PN and PN due to sacral perineurial cyst was significantly reduced with PRF therapy in the medium and long term when compared to other secondary PNs, including surgery, trauma, and diabetes. Discussion: The ultrasound-guided, improved, and innovative PRF/NB puncture path technique allows for gentler stimulation and faster identification of the pudendal nerve. The PRF technique may provide better treatments for primary PN and sacral perineurial cyst causing secondary PN in the medium and long term.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peptidergic signaling controls the dynamics of sickness behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic infection elicits sickness behaviors that promote recovery and survival of the host. For example, following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans modifies its sensory preferences to avoid the pathogen. Here we identify antagonistic neuromodulatory circuits that shape this sickness behavior. Using an unbiased cell-directed neuropeptide screen, we show that AVK neurons upregulate and release FMRFamide-like FLP-1 neuropeptides during infection to drive pathogen avoidance. Manipulations that increase or decrease AVK signaling accelerate or delay pathogen avoidance, respectively, implicating AVK in the dynamics of sickness behavior. FLP-1 neuropeptides act via the G-protein-coupled receptor DMSR-7 in RIM/RIC neurons to reduce tyraminergic/octopaminergic signaling that opposes pathogen avoidance. RIM/RIC neurons relay parallel signals from neuropeptides and the cytokine TGF-{beta} that represent internal and external regulators of pathogen avoidance. Our results demonstrate that antagonism between neuromodulatory systems results in slow, graded transitions between alternative behavioral states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor negative allosteric modulators affect the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol</a></h4>

              
                All drugs with the potential for addiction liability, including alcohol, produce distinct interoceptive stimulus effects that influence drug intake. Our lab has shown involvement of Group II metabotropic receptors (mGlu2/3) in the expression of alcohol interoceptive effects using a nonspecific mGlu2/3 agonist and antagonist. Furthermore, the anterior insular cortex (aIC) is a hub for interoceptive processing, including the interoceptive effects of alcohol. Therefore, the goal of the present work was to assess the independent functional contribution of mGlu2 and mGlu3, and the role of mGlu3 in the aIC, in the interoceptive effects of alcohol. As such, male, Long-Evans rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus effects of alcohol (2 g/kg, i.g.) from water (i.g.) using an operant, 2-lever drug discrimination procedure. To assess involvement of mGlu2 and mGlu3 in the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol, rats were administered the mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator (NAM, VU6001966; 0, 3, 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and the mGlu3-NAM (VU6010572; 0, 3, 6, 12 mg/kg, i.p.) before alcohol (2 g/kg, i.g.). mGlu2-NAM (6 mg/kg) and mGlu3-NAM (12 mg/kg) decreased alcohol-appropriate lever responses without affecting response rate, reflecting diminished interoceptive alcohol sensitivity. mGlu3-NAM microinjection (3 ug) into the aIC before alcohol decreased response rate to such an extent that alcohol-appropriate lever responding could not be determined. As such, mGlu3-NAM was tested in the aIC before water administration to determine if VU6010572 substitutes for alcohol. mGlu3-NAM VU6010572 (3 ug) in the aIC produced partial alcohol-like stimulus effects without affecting response rate. These data indicate that the newly developed mGlu2 and mGlu3 NAMs can modulate interoceptive effects of alcohol. The opposing effects of systemic vs. microinjected (aIC) mGlu3-NAM on alcohol interoceptive effects may reflect differences in receptor binding, a functionally relevant metabolite, and/or brain region differences in receptor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric activation of microglia in the hippocampus drives anxiodepressive consequences of trigeminal neuralgia</a></h4>

              
                Patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are often accompanied by anxiety and depression. Whether and how microglia are involved in TN-induced anxiodepressive remains unclear. Here, we unconventionally report that TN activities ipsilateral but not contralateral hippocampal microglia, upregulates ipsilateral hippocampal ATP and interleukin1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) levels, impairs ipsilateral hippocampal long-term potential (LTP), and induces anxiodepressive-like behaviros in a time-dependent manner in rodents. Specifically, activation of ipsilateral hippocampal microglia is necessary for TN-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors; and unilateral activating hippocampal microglia is sufficient to elicit an anxiodepressive state and impair LTP. Knockdown of ipsilateral hippocampal P2X7 receptor prevented TN-induced microglia activation and anxiodepressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microglia-derived IL-1{beta} mediates microglia activation-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviros and LTP impairment. Together, these findings suggest that priming of microglia with ATP/P2X7R in the ipsilateral hippocampus drives pain-related anxiodepressive-like behaviros via IL-1{beta}. Our results also reveal an asymmetric role of the bilateral hippocampus in TN-induced anxiety and depression.

                Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) and sleep disturbances. We hypothesized that treatment with sleep aids after TBI can ameliorate PTE. Methods: CD-1 mice underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI), sham craniotomy or no craniotomy. Sham and CCI groups underwent a month-long treatment with sleep aids including a dual orexin antagonist (DORA-22) or THIP (gaboxadol). We performed week-long EEG recordings during week-1 of treatment and again at months 1, 2 and 3. Seizure analysis occurred at all-time points and sleep analysis occurred in week-1 and month-1 recordings in all groups. Subsets of animals in sleep aid-treated and untreated CCI, and sham groups were subjected to voltage clamp experiments. Results: DORA-22 treated group had seizures at week-1 but none at months 1-3. TBI reduced amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in dentate granule cells and these changes were rescued by DORA-22 treatment. Sleep analysis showed that DORA-22 increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) in the first 4hours of lights-off whereas THIP increased REM sleep in the first 4-hours of lights-on in week-1, At month-1 both treatments reduced time in NREM during lights-off. TBI increased NREM delta power (N{Delta}) along with loss of the homeostatic overnight decline of N{Delta} in week-1 regardless of treatment. DORA-22 and THIP treatment restored N{Delta} to levels similar to no craniotomy animals at month-1. Conclusions: DORA-22 treatment suppressed posttraumatic seizures possibly due to enhanced GABAergic inhibition in dentate granule cells. DORA-22 may have therapeutic potential in suppressing PTE.

	<p>It is increasingly being understood that perceptual learning involves different types of plasticity. Thus, whereas the practice-based improvement in the ability to perform specific tasks is believed to rely on top-down plasticity, the capacity of sensory systems to passively adapt to the stimuli they are exposed to is believed to rely on bottom-up plasticity. However, top-down and bottom-up plasticity have never been investigated concurrently, and hence their relationship is not well understood. To examine whether passive exposure influences perceptual performance, we asked subjects to test their orientation discrimination performance around and orthogonal to the exposed orientation axes, at an exposed and an unexposed location while oriented sine-wave gratings were presented in a fixed position. Here we report that repetitive passive exposure to oriented sequences that are not linked to a specific task induces a persistent, bottom-up form of learning that is stronger than top-down practice learning and generalizes across complex stimulus dimensions. Importantly, orientation-specific exposure learning led to a robust improvement in the discrimination of complex stimuli (shapes and natural scenes). Our results indicate that long-term sensory adaptation by passive exposure should be viewed as a form of perceptual learning that is complementary to practice learning in that it reduces constraints on speed and generalization.</p>

	<p>There is a relationship between obesity and cognitive functioning. Our aim was to assess weight loss influence on global cognition and executive functioning (EF) in adults with obesity under a multidisciplinary weight loss program. In this six-month longitudinal study, we assessed 81 adults (age &amp;amp;lt; 50 years) with body mass index (BMI) &amp;amp;ge; 30. EF and global cognitive performance were evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychological Battery of Executive Functions (BANFE-2) and Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B). Median age was 40.0 years (IQR: 31.5&amp;amp;ndash;47, 61% women), and the median BMI was 41.4 (IQR: 36.7&amp;amp;ndash;45.9). At a six-month follow-up, the mean weight loss was 2.67% (29.6% of patients achieved &amp;amp;ge;5% weight loss). There was an improvement in EF evaluated with BANFE (p = 0.0024) and global cognition with MoCA (p = 0.0024). Women experienced more remarkable change, especially in EF. Weight loss did not correlate with cognitive performance, except for TMT-B (r-0.258, p = 0.026). In the regression analysis, only years of education predicted the MoCA score. This study showed that patients improved cognitive performance during the follow-up; nevertheless, the magnitude of weight loss did not correlate with cognitive improvement. Future studies are warranted to demonstrate if patients achieving &amp;amp;ge;5% weight loss can improve cognition, secondary to weight loss.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to obtain individual clinical and neuroimaging data of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor (ET) from 5 different European centers to identify predictors of outcome and to identify an optimal stimulation site.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and postoperative clinical tremor scores (for 12 months) as well as individual imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual electrode positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging and clinical data were used to calculate a probabilistic stimulation map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical analysis. Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to predict tremor improvement.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Probabilistic mapping of stimulation effects yielded a statistically significant cluster that was associated with a tremor improvement &gt;50%. This cluster of optimal stimulation extended from the posterior subthalamic area to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and coincided with a normative structural connectivity-based cerebellothalamic tract (CTT). The combined features “distance between the stimulation volume and the significant cluster” and “CTT activation” were used as a predictor of tremor improvement. This correctly classified a &gt;50% tremor improvement with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 57%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our multicenter ET probabilistic stimulation map identified an area of optimal stimulation along the course of the CTT. The results of this study are mainly descriptive until confirmed in independent datasets, ideally through prospective testing. This target will be made openly available and may be used to guide surgical planning and for computer-assisted programming of DBS in the future. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:602–612</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Deep Brain Stimulation for Arm Tremor: A Randomized Trial Comparing Two Targets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) effectively suppresses arm tremor. Uncontrolled studies suggest the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) may be superior. We compared the intra-individual efficacy of VIM- versus PSA-DBS on tremor suppression and arm function.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial at Oslo University Hospital in patients (18–80 years) with isolated or combined action tremor affecting at least one arm. Four-contact DBS leads were implanted (bi- or unilaterally) with a trajectory to cover the VIM (upper two contacts) and PSA (lower two contacts). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) post-surgery to: Group 1, VIM-stimulation months 0–3 (period 1), then PSA-stimulation months 4–6 (period 2); Group 2, PSA-stimulation first, then VIM-stimulation. Primary endpoint was the difference in improvement from baseline to the end of the VIM- versus PSA-period in the sum of the dominant arm tremor scores of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), items 5/6 + 10−14.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-five patients were randomized to Group 1 (<i>n</i> = 23) or 2 (<i>n</i> = 22). In the primary endpoint per-protocol analysis (mixed model, n = 40), mean difference in the sum FTMTRS score improvement for the dominant arm was −2.65 points (95% CI −4.33 to −0.97; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The difference in favour of PSA stimulation was highly significant in period 2, but not period 1.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our randomized trial demonstrated that PSA stimulation provided superior tremor suppression compared with VIM stimulation. A period effect reducing tremor for up to three months in both groups was most likely attributed to a post-surgery stun effect. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:585–601</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>CGG/GGC repeat expansion in <i>FMR1</i> and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> is reportedly associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12</i>, <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i>, which was previously identified in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12</i>, <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We screened for the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> in 1,346 movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in <i>LRP12</i> or <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, whereas 16 patients harbored &gt;40 CGG repeats in <i>GIPC1</i>, with 11 of these patients harboring &gt;60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded <i>GIPC1</i> allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by movement disorders in our population might harbor <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat expansion, with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (&lt;0.001). The clinical phenotypes of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in patients displaying <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> GGC repeat<i>-</i>positive movement disorders. Additionally, the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter hyperintensities but without typical <i>NOTCH2NLC</i>-related high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed deposition of intranuclear inclusions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The CGG repeat expansion in <i>GIPC1</i> might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704–715</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Personalizing Deep Brain Stimulation Using Advanced Imaging Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>With a growing appreciation for interindividual anatomical variability and patient-specific brain connectivity, advanced imaging sequences offer the opportunity to directly visualize anatomical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating their clinical utility, however, has hindered their broad implementation in clinical practice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences, the present study identified a thalamic hypointensity that holds promise as a visual marker in DBS. To validate the clinical utility of the identified hypointensity, we retrospectively analyzed 65 patients (26 female, mean age = 69.1 ± 12.7 years) who underwent DBS in the treatment of essential tremor. We characterized its neuroanatomical substrates and evaluated the hypointensity's ability to predict clinical outcome using stimulation volume modeling and voxelwise mapping. Finally, we determined whether the hypointensity marker could predict symptom improvement on a patient-specific level.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Anatomical characterization suggested that the identified hypointensity constituted the terminal part of the dentatorubrothalamic tract. Overlap between DBS stimulation volumes and the hypointensity in standard space significantly correlated with tremor improvement (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and distance to hotspots previously reported in the literature (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, <i>p</i> = 7.9e-4). In contrast, the amount of variance explained by other anatomical atlas structures was reduced. When accounting for interindividual neuroanatomical variability, the predictive power of the hypointensity increased further (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings introduce and validate a novel imaging-based marker attainable from FGATIR sequences that has the potential to personalize and inform targeting and programming in DBS for essential tremor. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:613–628</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a novel method for monitoring the integrity of motor neurons in vivo by quantifying net retrograde axonal transport.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The method uses single photon emission computed tomography to quantify retrograde transport to spinal cord of tetanus toxin fragment C (<sup>125</sup>I-TTC) following intramuscular injection. We characterized the transport profiles in 3 transgenic mouse models carrying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated genes, aging mice, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice following CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Lastly, we studied the effect of prior immunization of tetanus toxoid on the transport profile of TTC.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This technique defines a quantitative profile of net retrograde axonal transport of TTC in living mice. The profile is distinctly abnormal in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice as young as 65 days (presymptomatic) and worsens with disease progression. Moreover, this method detects a distinct therapeutic benefit of gene editing in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice well before other clinical parameters (eg, grip strength) show improvement. Symptomatic transgenic PFN1<sup>C71G/C71G</sup> ALS mice display gross reductions in net retrograde axonal transport, which is also disturbed in asymptomatic mice harboring a human <i>C9ORF72</i> transgene with an expanded GGGGCC repeat motif. In wild-type mice, net retrograde axonal transport declines with aging. Lastly, prior immunization with tetanus toxoid does not preclude use of this assay.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This assay of net retrograde axonal transport has broad potential clinical applications and should be particularly valuable as a physiological biomarker that permits early detection of benefit from potential therapies for motor neuron diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:716–729</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke etiology remains undetermined in 30% of cases. We explored the genetic architecture of stroke classified as undetermined to test if mechanisms and risk factors underlying large-artery atherosclerotic (LAAS), cardioembolic (CES), and small-vessel stroke (SVS) contribute to its pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed genome-wide data from 16,851 ischemic stroke cases and 32,473 controls. Using polygenic risk scores for LAAS, CES, and SVS, we assessed the genetic overlap with stroke of undetermined source and used pairwise genomewide association study (GWAS-PW) to search for shared loci. We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potentially causal risk factors of stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetic risk for LAS, CES, and SVS was associated with stroke of undetermined source pointing to overlap in their genetic architecture. Pairwise analyses revealed 19 shared loci with LAAS, 2 with CES, and 5 with SVS that have been implicated in atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Genetic liability to both carotid atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation was associated with stroke of undetermined source, but the association with atrial fibrillation was attenuated after excluding cases with incomplete diagnostic workup. MR analyses showed effects of genetically determinants of blood pressure, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, MCP-1/CCL2 levels), and factor XI levels on stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Stroke of undetermined source shares genetic and vascular risk factors with other stroke subtypes, especially LAAS, thus highlighting the diagnostic limitations of current subtyping approaches. The potentially causal associations with carotid atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors might have implications for prevention strategies targeting these mechanisms.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate functional and safety outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with M2 occlusion and examine their association with perfusion imaging mismatch and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-and IA-TNK parts 1 and 2) and 2 prospective nonrandomized studies (INSPIRE and SELECT), we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–2) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 517 patients (EVT = 195 and MM = 322), baseline median (interquartile range [IQR]) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 13 (8–19) in EVT versus 10 (6–15) in MM, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. Pretreatment ischemic core did not differ (EVT = 10 [0–24] ml vs MM = 9 [3–21] ml, <i>p</i> = 0.59). Compared to MM, EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence (68.3 vs 61.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25–4.67, <i>p</i> = 0.008, inverse probability of treatment weights [IPTW]-OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.00–3.75, <i>p</i> = 0.05) with a shift toward better mRS outcomes (adjusted cOR = 2.02, 95% CI:1.23–3.29, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and lower mortality (5 vs 10%, aOR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12–0.87, <i>p</i> = 0.025). EVT was associated with higher functional independence in patients with a perfusion mismatch profile (EVT = 70.7% vs MM = 61.3%, aOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.09–4.79, <i>p</i> = 0.029, IPTW-OR = 2.02, 1.08–3.78, <i>p</i> = 0.029), whereas no difference was found in those without mismatch (EVT = 43.8% vs MM = 62.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.17, IPTW-OR: 0.71, 95% CI = 0.18–2.78, <i>p</i> = 0.62). Functional independence was more frequent with EVT in patients with moderate or severe strokes, as defined by baseline NIHSS above any thresholds from 6 to 10, whereas there was no difference between groups with milder strokes below these thresholds.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared to MM. This association was primarily observed in patients with a mismatch profile and those with higher stroke severity. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:629–639</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bilateral synchronous cortical activity occurs during sleep, attention, and seizures. Canonical models place the thalamus at the center of bilateral cortical synchronization because it generates bilateral sleep spindle oscillations and primarily generalized absence seizures. However, classical studies suggest that the corpus callosum mediates bilateral cortical synchronization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We mapped the spread of right frontal lobe-onset, focal to bilateral seizures in mice and modified it using chemo and optogenetic suppression of motor thalamic nucleus and corpus callosotomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizures from the right cortex spread faster to the left cortex than to the left thalamus. The 2 thalami have minimal monosynaptic commissural connections compared to the massive commissure corpus callosum. Chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic inhibition of the right ventrolateral thalamic nucleus did not alter inter-hemispheric seizure spread. However, anterior callosotomy delayed bilateral seizure oscillations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical oscillations amplify focal onset motor seizures, and corpus callosum spreads them bilaterally. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:682–696</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play a significant role in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on mitochondrial function and cell metabolism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We obtained and characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, in situ respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected several differences in MS astrocytes including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, which have already been linked to MS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we describe the metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug targeting assays in vitro. Our findings recapitulate several disease features described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Secretory Vesicle Failure in Parkinson's Disease Occurs in Human Platelets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The presence of elevated dopamine (DA) and its major metabolites in the cytosol of neurons has been associated with their vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Over 99% of the cell's amines are confined to secretory vesicles (SVs), making these structures fundamental in the regulation of cytosolic DA levels. SVs of platelets use similar, if not the same mechanisms to accumulate serotonin in SVs as dopaminergic neurons do to store DA. Hence, any functional defects in platelets probably mirrors events in DA neurons.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have isolated fresh platelets from the blood of 75 PD patients, 116 matched controls and 24 patients with Parkinsonism, assaying serotonin handling (basal content, accumulation, secretion and spontaneous leakage).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a dramatic decrease in the serotonin content and uptake by SVs, as well as decreased thrombin-induced release by platelets from PD patients but not in those from most Parkinsonism cases. Platelets from PD patients also failed to retain serotonin in SVs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings indicate a functional impairment in the handling of amines by SVs in PD patients. This defect may serve as a biomarker of PD, and the approach described here may be potentially used for the subclinical detection of PD and to establish a platform to assay disease modifying drugs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) transcription factors have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature nervous system. To date, a neurological disease association has been conclusively established for only the <i>Early B-cell Factor-3</i> (<i>EBF3</i>) COE family member through the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with autism spectrum/neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Here, we identify a symptom severity risk association with missense variants primarily disrupting the zinc finger domain (ZNF) in <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phenotypic assessment of 41 individuals was combined with a literature meta-analysis for a total of 83 individuals diagnosed with <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD. Quantitative diagnostic phenotypic and symptom severity scales were developed to compare <i>EBF3</i> variant type and location to identify genotype–phenotype correlations. To stratify the effects of <i>EBF3</i> variants disrupting either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the ZNF, we used <i>in vivo</i> fruit fly UAS-GAL4 expression and <i>in vitro</i> luciferase assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that patient symptom severity correlates with <i>EBF3</i> missense variants perturbing the ZNF, which is a key protein domain required for stabilizing the interaction between EBF3 and the target DNA sequence. We found that ZNF-associated variants failed to restore viability in the fruit fly and impaired transcriptional activation. However, the recurrent variant EBF3 p.Arg209Trp in the DBD is capable of partially rescuing viability in the fly and preserved transcriptional activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We describe a symptom severity risk association with ZNF perturbations and EBF3 loss-of-function in the largest reported cohort to date of EBF3-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical va <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical value for newly identified patients with <i>EBF3</i> gene variants. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The optimal target and connectivity for DBS in Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, little is known about the optimal target and whether efficacy depends on connectivity of the stimulation site. Using outcome data from the ESTEL trial, we aimed to determine the optimal target and connectivity for DBS in LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>20 patients underwent bilateral DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM). Outcome was % seizure reduction from baseline after three months of DBS, defined using three measures (monthly seizure diaries, 24-hour EEG, and a novel diary-EEG composite). Probabilistic stimulation mapping identified thalamic locations associated with higher/lower efficacy. Two substitute diffusion MRI datasets (a normative dataset from healthy subjects and a “disease-matched” dataset from a separate group of LGS patients) were used to calculate structural connectivity between DBS sites and a map of areas known to express epileptic activity in LGS, derived from our previous EEG-fMRI research.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results were similar across the three outcome measures. Stimulation was most efficacious in the anterior and inferolateral “parvocellular” CM border, extending into the ventral lateral nucleus (posterior subdivision). There was a positive association between diary-EEG composite seizure reduction and connectivity to areas of <i>a priori</i> EEG-fMRI activation, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, putamen, and pontine brainstem. In contrast, outcomes were not associated with baseline clinical variables.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Efficacious CM-DBS for LGS is linked to stimulation of the parvocellular CM and the adjacent ventral lateral nucleus, and is associated with connectivity to, and thus likely modulation of, the “secondary epileptic network” underlying the shared electroclinical manifestations of LGS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Early predictors of clinical and MRI outcomes using LASSO in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify predictors in common between different clinical and MRI outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common between clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a LASSO-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6s, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 vs. 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 vs. 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 vs. 0.75 for SPMS, respectively. In contrast, 10-year MRI outcomes were more strongly influenced by initial T2LV and BPF than clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Early prognostication of MS is possible using LASSO modeling to identify a limited set of accessible clinical features. These predictive models can be clinically useable in treatment decision-making once implemented into web-based calculators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Motor progression and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The motor severity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is believed to parallel with dopaminergic terminal degeneration in the striatum although the terminal was reported to be virtually absent by 4 years post-diagnosis. Meanwhile, neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN) elucidated a variability at early stages and gradual loss with less variability 10 years post-diagnosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the correlation between motor impairments and striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration and nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss at early to advanced stages of PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety-three PD patients were divided into early and advanced subgroups based on motor symptom duration and whether motor fluctuation was present. Striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration was evaluated using a presynaptic dopamine transporter tracer, <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT. Nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron density was assessed by neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In patients with early-stage (motor symptoms for ≤8 or 10 years), motor dysfunction during the drug-off state was paralleled by a decline in <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum despite the absence of a correlation with reductions in NM-MRI signals in SN. Meanwhile, in patients with advanced-stage (motor symptoms for &gt;8 or 10 years and with fluctuation), the degree of motor deficits during the drug-off state was not correlated with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum, despite its significant negative correlation with NM-MRI signals in SN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose striatal dopaminergic terminal loss measured using <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT and nigral dopamine neuron loss assessed with NM-MRI as early-stage and advanced-stage motor impairments biomarkers, respectively.</p>

                Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) is a rare syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) gene. TCF4 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is critical for neurodevelopment and brain function through its binding to cis-regulatory elements of target genes. One potential therapeutic strategy for PTHS is to identify dysregulated target genes and normalize their dysfunction. Here, we propose that SCN10A is an important target gene of TCF4 that is an applicable therapeutic approach for PTHS. Scn10a encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 and is consistently shown to be upregulated in PTHS mouse models. In this perspective, we review prior literature and present novel data that suggests inhibiting Nav1.8 in PTHS mouse models is effective at normalizing neuron function, brain circuit activity and behavioral abnormalities and posit this therapeutic approach as a treatment for PTHS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimation of cochlear frequency selectivity using a convolution model of forward-masked compound action potentials</a></h4>

              
                Frequency selectivity is a fundamental property of the peripheral auditory system; however, the invasiveness of auditory nerve (AN) experiments limits its study in the human ear. Compound action potentials (CAPs) associated with forward-masking have been suggested as an alternative means to assess cochlear frequency selectivity. Previous methods relied on an empirical comparison of AN and CAP tuning curves in animal models, arguably not taking full advantage of the information contained in forward-masked CAPs. In this work, we seek to provide a direct estimate of the quality factor characterizing AN frequency tuning using many forward-masked CAP responses. The method is based on a convolution model of the CAP that takes into account the masking of AN populations induced by notched-noise maskers with various notch widths and attenuations. The model produces masking patterns that, once convolved by a unitary response, predict forward-masked CAP waveforms. Model parameters, including those characterizing frequency selectivity, are fine-tuned by minimizing waveform prediction errors across the different masking conditions, yielding robust estimates. The method was applied to click-evoked CAPs at the round window of anesthetized chinchillas. The estimated quality factor Q10 as a function of center frequency is shown to closely match the average quality factor obtained from AN-fiber tuning curves, without the need for an empirical correction factor. Beyond the estimation of frequency selectivity, the proposed model proves to be accurate in predicting forward-masked CAP responses, and therefore could be extended to study more complex aspects of cochlear signal processing using a similar experimental approach.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humoral signaling-mediated effects of unilateral brain injury: differences in the left-right sided afferent responses</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of neural tracts descending from the brain to the spinal cord after brain trauma and stroke causes postural and sensorimotor deficits. We previously showed that unilateral lesion to the sensorimotor cortex in rats with completely transected thoracic spinal cord produced asymmetry in hindlimb posture and withdrawal reflexes. Supraspinal signals to hindlimb muscles may be transmitted through the paravertebral chain of sympathetic ganglia that remain intact after the transection. We here demonstrated that prior transection of the spinal cord at the cervical level that was rostrally to segments with preganglionic sympathetic neurons, did not abolish formation of asymmetry in hindlimb posture and musculo-articular resistance to stretch after unilateral brain injury. Thus not the sympathetic system but humoral signals may mediate the effects of brain injury on the lumbar spinal circuits. The asymmetric responses in rats with transected spinal cords were eliminated by bilateral lumbar dorsal rhizotomy after the left-side brain injury, but resistant to deafferentation after the right-side brain lesion. Two mechanisms, one dependent on and one independent of afferent input may account for asymmetric hindlimb motor responses. Resistance to deafferentation may be due to sustained stretch- and effort-unrelated muscle contractions that is often observed in patients with central lesions. Left-right asymmetry is unusual feature of these mechanisms that both are activated by humoral signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immediate neural network impact after the loss of a semantic hub</a></h4>

              
                The human brain extracts meaning from the world using an extensive neural system for semantic knowledge. Whether such broadly distributed systems crucially depend on or can compensate for the loss of one of their highly interconnected hubs is controversial. The strongest level of causal evidence for the role of a brain hub is to evaluate its acute network-level impact following disconnection and any rapid functional compensation that ensues. We report rare neurophysiological data from two patients who underwent awake intracranial recordings during a speech prediction task immediately before and after neurosurgical treatment that required disconnection of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), a crucial hub for semantic knowledge. Informed by a predictive coding framework, we tested three sets of hypotheses, including diaschisis causing disruption in interconnected sites and incomplete or complete compensation by other language-critical and speech processing sites. Immediately after ATL disconnection, we observed highly specific neurophysiological alterations in the recorded fronto-temporal network, including abnormally magnified high gamma responses to the speech sounds in auditory cortex. We also observed evidence for rapid compensation, seen as focal increases in effective connectivity involving language-critical sites in the inferior frontal gyrus and speech processing sites in auditory cortex. However, compensation was incomplete, in part because after ATL disconnection speech prediction signals were depleted in auditory cortex. This study provides direct causal evidence for a semantic hub in the human brain and shows striking neural impact and a rapid attempt at compensation in a neural network after the loss of one of its hubs.

                Calcium dependency is presently an essential assumption in modelling the neuromodulatory effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Among the various neuromodulatory TMS protocols, theta-burst stimulation (TBS) at present is the fastest intervention to generate strong effects. A decade ago, Y.Z. Huang et al. developed a first neuromodulation model to explain the bidirectional effects of TBS based on postsynaptic intracellular calcium concentration elevation. We discover, however, that the published computer code is not consistent with the model formulations in the corresponding paper. Further analysis confirms that the computer model with an index confusion was used for fitting the experimental results, running the simulation, and plotting the corresponding figures in the original publication. This paper intends to fix the computer code and additionally create a non-convex optimisation solution for re-calibrating the model. After re-calibration, the revised model outperforms the initial model in accuracy describing the MEP amplitudes of TBS-induced after-effects under specific situations.

                Field potential oscillations in the olfactory system of vertebrates and invertebrates are prominent and well-studied, but their functions remain nevertheless enigmatic. Spatial networks are thought to play a role in olfactory discrimination in different species, but their analysis is frequently complicated by behavior, learning and respiration (sniffing). Here, we show that in a sniffing-free model (trout), the relevant feature for discriminating odorant identity is the information conveyed by the oscillatory activity in a spatially distributed network, including the olfactory bulb and the telencephalic regions Vv and Dp. Specifically, information-based methods based on spectral decoding, information sharing, and information redundancy distinguished odorant identity across spatially distant regions while classical spectral analyses did not. Our study demonstrates that olfactory oscillations are carriers of spatially distributed odor information across the teleost olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual working memory recruits two functionally distinct alpha rhythms in posterior cortex</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory activity in the human brain is dominated by posterior alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz), which have been shown to be functionally relevant in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Although posterior alpha oscillations are commonly considered a single oscillator anchored at an individual alpha frequency (IAF; ~10 Hz), previous work suggests that IAF reflects a spatial mixture of different brain rhythms. In this study, we assess whether Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can disentangle functionally distinct posterior alpha rhythms in the context of visual short-term memory retention. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 33 subjects while performing a visual working memory task. Group analysis at sensor level suggested the existence of a single posterior alpha oscillator that increases in power and decreases in frequency during memory retention. Conversely, single-subject analysis of independent components revealed the existence of two dissociable alpha rhythms: one that increases in power during memory retention (Alpha1) and another one that decreases in power (Alpha2). Alpha1 and Alpha2 rhythms were differentially modulated by the presence of visual distractors (Alpha1 increased in power while Alpha2 decreased) and had an opposite relationship with accuracy (positive for Alpha1 and negative for Alpha2). In addition, Alpha1 rhythms showed a lower peak frequency, a narrower peak width, a greater relative peak amplitude and a more central source than Alpha2 rhythms. Together, our results demonstrate that modulations in posterior alpha oscillations during short-term memory retention reflect the dynamics of at least two distinct brain rhythms with different functions and spatiospectral characteristics.

                Background: Epilepsy is a very invalidating pathology characterized by the unpredictable appearance of abnormal cerebral activity leading to seizures and co-morbidities. The ability to detect and even predict seizures is a major challenge and many research laboratories are using rodents' models of epilepsy to unravel possible mechanisms. The gold standard to record and detect seizures is electroencephalography, but it is very invasive. For rodents used in research, video analysis is a very interesting approach but the major disadvantages are that it is time consuming, prone to human error, and not very reproducible. Commercial solutions for detailed phenotyping analysis on humans or rodents exist but they are costly. Some open source software programs are also available, they provide very interesting and precise behavior data, but none of them are made for high throughput analysis of a large number of video files generated by long lasting recordings. New method: We developed an open-source python-based package of two software programs that enable automated video acquisition and simple motion analysis associated with a spectral power analysis, which enable a semi-automated identification of convulsive seizures. The method needs cheap webcams and a computer or a server. Results: Using two murine epilepsy models (Nav1.1 mutations), we have compared our motion analysis software to human visual inspection and found an 88.8% accuracy in convulsive seizures detection. We then compare our method to the gold standard electrocorticogram analysis and found a 93.2% accuracy. The motion analysis is also interesting to get a readout of the animal activity without the invasiveness of electromyogram recordings. Conclusions: This new method is easy to use, cost-effective and allows: 1) detection of convulsive seizures in a noninvasive way, 2) high speed analysis of a large number of video files with a good accuracy, and 3) automated acquisition and semi-automated analysis of a very large number of files.

                In the comment on the article [Optica 8, 12 (2021)], the authors performed theoretical calculation to show that with a 1.1 NA objective and 140 fs laser pulses with single pulse energy of 2.2 nJ, and 80 MHz repetition rate, the focal point temperature rises 0.3 K and reaches equilibrium after 100 us in water. They suggest that the damage to brain tissue by laser could not be caused by thermal effects but rather by plasma-mediated chemical effects. To quantify the thermal accumulation due to the fs laser illumination in living animals, we used a thermocouple sensor to measure the temperature change in the vicinity of the laser focus at a depth of 300 um in the adult mouse cortex. Our results show that at 930 nm wavelength, 25 um from the laser focus, 19-300 mW laser can all lead to a brain tissue temperature rise of more than 0.3 K at 1 second and the maximum equilibrium temperature rise of more than 28 K. These experimental measurements are significantly higher than theoretically calculated values in the comment. These results suggest that the thermal accumulation effect of focused low-energy pulses from fs laser oscillators could contribute significantly to the collateral damage in the living brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single acoustic closed loop stimulation in mice to modulate hippocampo-thalamo-cortical activity and performance</a></h4>

              
                Neural brain rhythms of sleep reflect neuronal activity underlying sleep-associated memory consolidation. The modulation of brain rhythms, for instance the sleep slow oscillation (SO) is used both to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms as well as to measure the impact on presumed functional correlates. In humans, auditory closed-loop stimulation targeted to the SO Up-state successfully enhanced the slow oscillation rhythm and phase-dependent spindle activity, although effects on memory retention have varied. Here, we aim to disclose relations between stimulation induced hippocampo-thalamo-cortical activity and retention performance on a hippocampus dependent task in mice. Closed-loop acoustic stimuli applied during four SO phases always acutely increased sharp wave ripple (SPWR) activity without disrupting non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Stimulation achieved an above chance preference index for stimuli delivered across a 3 h retention interval of sleep at the SO Up-state and at the Down-to-Up-state, but not at the Down-state nor late Up-state/Up-to Down-state. Results support the use of closed-loop acoustic stimulation in mice to investigate the inter-regional mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theory of spontaneous persistent activity and inactivity in vivo reveals differential cortico-entorhinal functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Persistent activity is thought to mediate working memory. While such stimulus evoked persistence is well studied, mechanisms of internally generated or spontaneous persistence in vivo are unknown. Further, current theories based on attractor dynamics focus on elevated activity as a memory substrate, while little attention has focused on the role of inactivity attractors. Here, we present a mean field model of functional interaction between large cortical networks that predicts both spontaneous persistent activity (SPA) and inactivity (SPI); the latter has never been seen before in experiments or models. We confirm these predictions using simultaneously recorded neocortical local field potential (LFP) and the membrane potential (Vm) of identified excitatory neurons from several brain areas in vivo during slow oscillations, especially from layer 3 of the medial (MECIII) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LECIII), which show SPA and SPI. By matching model and experimental statistics, we predict the relative strength of internal and external excitation in the LECIII and MECIII networks. Our predictions match anatomical data. Further, the model predicts, and the experiments confirm, that SPA and SPI are quantized by cortical UDS and follow the statistics of a history dependent Bernoulli process. These convergent, theory-experiment results thus reveal the differential nature of cortico-entorhinal functional connectivity, resulting in a unique pattern of persistent activity and persistent inactivity, a novel and energetically efficient memory substrate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesian interpolation for power laws in neural data analysis</a></h4>

              
                Power laws arise in a variety of phenomena ranging from matter undergoing phase transition to the distribution of word frequencies in the English language. Usually, their presence is only apparent when data is abundant, and accurately determining their exponents often requires even larger amounts of data. As the scale of recordings in neuroscience becomes larger, an increasing number of studies attempt to characterise potential power-law relationships in neural data. In this paper, we aim to discuss the potential pitfalls that one faces in such efforts and to promote a Bayesian interpolation framework for this purpose. We apply this framework to synthetic data and to data from a recent study of large-scale recordings in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where the exponent of a power-law scaling in the data played an important role: its value was argued to determine whether the population's stimulus-response relationship is smooth, and experimental data was provided to confirm that this is indeed so. Our analysis shows that with such data types and sizes as we consider here, the best-fit values found for the parameters of the power law and the uncertainty for these estimates are heavily dependent on the noise model assumed for the estimation, the range of the data chosen, and (with all other things being equal) the particular recordings. It is thus challenging to offer a reliable statement about the exponents of the power law. Our analysis, however, shows that this does not affect the conclusions regarding the smoothness of the population response to low-dimensional stimuli but casts doubt on those to natural images. We discuss the implications of this result for the neural code in the V1 and offer the approach discussed here as a framework that future studies, perhaps exploring larger ranges of data, can employ as their starting point to examine power-law scalings in neural data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resilience to anxiety and anhedonia after predator scent stress is accompanied by increased nucleus accumbens mGlu5 in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Despite the higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women, the majority of preclinical neuroscience research has been conducted utilizing male subjects. We have found that male rats exposed to the predator scent 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) show heterogenous development of long-term anxiety-like behavior and conditioned fear to the TMT environment. Stress-Resilient males exhibit increased mGlu5 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex. Here we sought to determine whether the same behavioral and genetic responses would be observed in female rats exposed to TMT. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TMT for ten minutes, while Controls were exposed to an unscented environment. Anxiety and anhedonia were assessed 7-14 days later with elevated plus maze (EPM), acoustic startle response (ASR), light/dark box, and sucrose preference test. TMT-exposed females spent less time in the EPM open arms and exhibited greater startle amplitude, and reduced sucrose intake compared to Controls. Median split analyses conducted on EPM and sucrose intake yielded phenotypes that displayed behavior in the light/dark box consistent with EPM and sucrose testing. Unlike male Susceptible rats, female Susceptible rats showed no freezing when re-exposed to the TMT context, nor did Resilient female rats present elevated BLA mGlu5 mRNA levels. Instead, Susceptible females had greater BLA mGlu5 than Resilient or Control rats. This work indicates that, as in humans, rats exhibit sex-dependent responses to stress. This translational animal model may provide insight into how females are uniquely affected by PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine release at the time of a predicted aversive outcome causally controls the trajectory and expression of conditioned behavior</a></h4>

              
                Background: The inability to predict when aversive stimuli will and will not occur in is a hallmark of anxiety and stress disorders. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is sufficient and necessary for aversive learning and has been linked to both anxiety and stress disorder symptomatology. Thus, understanding how dopamine controls associative learning in response to aversive stimuli is critical to understanding the role of dopamine in behavior in health and disease. Methods: Using an optical dopamine sensor combined with in-vivo fiber photometry in the NAc core of male and female C57BL/6J mice (N=38), we recorded dopamine responses to expected and omitted aversive outcomes during learning. We derived predictions from a theory-driven model of associative learning (Kutlu-Calipari-Schmajuk, KCS model) and tested the causality of these predictions using optogenetics. Results: Dopamine release was evoked by the predicted omission of aversive stimuli in a fashion that cannot be explained by dopamine as a reward-based prediction signal. The magnitude of the dopamine response during omissions scaled with predictions about the probability of their occurrence; however, dopamine did not track the associative value of predictive cues. Finally, we showed that the observed effects are causal to learned behavior and can only be explained by dopamine signaling the perceived saliency of predicted aversive events. Conclusions: We elucidate the role of NAc core dopamine signaling in aversive learning in a theory-based and stimulus-specific fashion and offer potential avenues for understanding the neural mechanisms involved in anxiety and stress disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-dependent choice and evaluation in real-world consumer behavior</a></h4>

              
                A body of work spanning neuroscience, economics, and psychology indicates that decision-making is context-dependent, which means that the value of an option depends not only on the option in question, but also on the other options in the choice set--or the 'context'. While context effects have been observed primarily in small-scale laboratory studies with tightly constrained, artificially constructed choice sets, it remains to be determined whether these context effects take hold in real-world choice problems, where choice sets are large and decisions driven by rich histories of direct experience. Here, we investigate whether valuations are context-dependent in real-world choice by analyzing a large restaurant rating dataset (Yelp.com) as well as two independent replication datasets which provide complementary operationalizations of restaurant choice. We find that users make fewer ratings-maximizing choices in choice sets with higher-rated options--a hallmark of context-dependent choice-- and that post-choice restaurant ratings also varied systematically with the ratings of unchosen restaurants. Furthermore, in a follow-up laboratory experiment using hypothetical choice sets matched to the real-world data, we find further support for the idea that subjective valuations of restaurants are scaled in accordance with the choice context, providing corroborating evidence for a general mechanistic-level account of these effects. Taken together, our results provide a potent demonstration of context-dependent choice in real-world choice settings, manifesting both in decisions and subjective valuation of options.

	<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) signifies a serious worldwide concern to public health. Both transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells synergize the progression of infection in host, which may exacerbate symptoms and/or progression of other chronic diseases such as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Oxidative stress is a well-known cause of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and PD. In the current study, we aimed to explore the influence of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) stress pathway under SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and in human cell model of PD. Furthermore, we investigated whether they are interconnected and if the ER stress inhibitors could inhibit cell death and provide cellular protection. To achieve this aim, we have incorporated in silico analysis obtained from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a literature review and laboratory data. The neurotoxin, 6-hydroxy dopamine (6OHDA), was used to mimic the biochemical and neuropathological characteristics of PD by inducing oxidative stress in dopamine-containing neurons differentiated from ReNVM cell line (dDCNs). Furthermore, we explored if ER stress influences activation of caspases-2, -4 and -8 in SARS-CoV-2 and in stressed dDCNs. Our laboratory data using Western blot, immunocytochemistry and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analyses indicated that 6OHDA-induced toxicity triggered activation of caspases-2, 4 and -8 in dDCNs. Under SARS-CoV-2 infection of different cell types, GSEA revealed cell-specific sensitivities to oxidative and ER stresses. Cardiomyocytes and type II alveolar epithelial-like cells were more vulnerable to oxidative stress than neural cells. On the other side, only cardiomyocytes activated the unfolded protein response, however, the PERK pathway was operative in both cardiomyocytes and neural cells. In addition, caspase-4 activation by a SARS-CoV-2 was observed via in silico analyses. These results demonstrate that the ER stress pathway under oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 and PD are interconnected using diverse pathways. Furthermore, our results using the ER stress inhibitor and caspase specific inhibitors provided cellular protection suggesting that the use of specific inhibitors can provide effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 and PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Alpha blocking and 1/fβ spectral scaling in resting EEG can be accounted for by a sum of damped alpha band oscillatory processes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rick Evertz, Damien G. Hicks, David T. J. Liley</p>

The dynamical and physiological basis of alpha band activity and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise in the EEG are the subject of continued speculation. Here we conjecture, on the basis of empirical data analysis, that both of these features may be economically accounted for through a single process if the resting EEG is conceived of being the sum of multiple stochastically perturbed alpha band damped linear oscillators with a distribution of dampings (relaxation rates). The modulation of alpha-band and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise activity by changes in damping is explored in eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting state EEG. We aim to estimate the distribution of dampings by solving an inverse problem applied to EEG power spectra. The characteristics of the damping distribution are examined across subjects, sensors and recording condition (EC/EO). We find that there are robust changes in the damping distribution between EC and EO recording conditions across participants. The estimated damping distributions are found to be predominantly bimodal, with the number and position of the modes related to the sharpness of the alpha resonance and the scaling (<i>β</i>) of the power spectrum (1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup>). The results suggest that there exists an intimate relationship between resting state alpha activity and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise with changes in both governed by changes to the damping of the underlying alpha oscillatory processes. In particular, alpha-blocking is observed to be the result of the most weakly damped distribution mode becoming more heavily damped. The results suggest a novel way of characterizing resting EEG power spectra and provides new insight into the central role that damped alpha-band activity may play in characterising the spatio-temporal features of resting state EEG.

                It is well established that degradation of perforant path fibers is associated with age-related cognitive dysfunction and CA3 hyperactivity. Whether this fiber loss triggers a cascade of other functional changes within the hippocampus circuit has not been causatively established, however. Thus, the current study evaluated the effect of perforant path fiber loss on neuronal activity in CA3 and layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in relation to mnemonic similarity task performance. Expression of the immediate early gene Arc was quantified in rats that received a unilateral right hemisphere transection of the perforant path or sham surgery that cut the cortex but left the fibers intact. Behavior-related expression of Arc mRNA was measured to test the hypothesis that fiber loss leads to elevated activation of CA3 and LEC neurons, as previously observed in aged rats that were impaired on the mnemonic similarity task. Transection of perforant path fibers, which has previously been shown to lead to a decline in mnemonic similarity task performance, did not alter Arc expression. Arc expression in CA3, however, was correlated with task performance on the more difficult discrimination trials across both surgical groups. These observations further support a link between CA3 activity and mnemonic similarity task performance but suggest the reduced input from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, as observed in old age, does not causatively elevate CA3 activity.

                Brain oscillations in the theta (3-7 Hz) and alpha (7-13 Hz) bands are implicated in visual perception and attention. We show that in an attentional blink paradigm, where the task requires detecting two targets presented in rapid succession, perceptual performance varied with the rhythms at these two frequencies, which we name attentional rhythmic blink. In the absence of distractors, second target detection performance fluctuated at the theta rhythm, but the fluctuation frequency shifted toward alpha rhythm when distractors were interspersed with the targets. We further show, in magnetoencephalography experiments, that a change in the dominant frequency of ongoing neural oscillations accompanied those in perceptual performance, with the parietal theta being more pronounced in the no-distractor and the occipital alpha in the distractor conditions, respectively. We propose that perceptual rhythms may depend on the power balance between ongoing neural oscillations, determined by the task-specific demand.

                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is a mechanism that, amongst other known and latent critical functions, ensures activated brain regions are adequately supplied with oxygen and glucose. This biological phenomenon underpins non-invasive perfusion-related neuroimaging techniques and recent reports have implicated NVC impairment in several neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, much remains unknown regarding NVC in health and disease, and only recently has there been burgeoning recognition of a close interplay with brain thermodynamics. Accordingly, we developed a novel multi-modal approach to systematically modulate cortical temperature and interrogate the spatiotemporal dynamics of sensory-evoked NVC. We show that changes in cortical temperature profoundly and intricately modulate NVC, with low temperatures associated with diminished oxygen delivery, and high temperatures inducing a distinct vascular oscillation. These observations provide novel insights into the relationship between NVC and brain thermodynamics, with important implications for brain temperature related therapies, functional biomarkers of elevated brain temperature, and in-vivo methods to study neurovascular coupling.

                Pain relief by vibrotactile touch is a common human experience. Previous neurophysiological investigations focused on spinal mechanisms in anesthetized animals. However, whether and how cortex, especially the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), is involved in this process in behaving animals remains unknown. We discovered that vibrotactile reafferent signals from self-generated whisking significantly reduce facial nociception. Specific blocking of touch transmission from thalamus to barrel cortex (S1B) abolished whisking induced analgesia. In vivo imaging showed that tactile and noxious stimuli differentially activate S1B neurons. Intrinsic manifold analysis of S1B population activity revealed that whisking pushes the transition of neural state induced by noxious stimuli towards the state encoding non-nocifensive actions. Thus, S1B contains nociceptive representations and integrates tactile and painful signals to enable touch mediated pain relief.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">3D pose estimation enables virtual head-fixation in freely moving rats</a></h4>

              
                The impact of spontaneous movements on neuronal activity has created the need to quantify behavior. We present a versatile framework to directly capture the 3D motion of freely definable body points in a marker-free manner with high precision and reliability. Combining the tracking with neural recordings revealed multiplexing of information in the motor cortex neurons of freely moving rats. By integrating multiple behavioral variables into a model of the neural response, we derived a virtual head-fixation for which the influence of specific body movements was removed. This strategy enabled us to analyze the behavior of interest (e.g., front paw movements). Thus, we unveiled an unexpectedly large fraction of neurons in the motor cortex with tuning to the paw movements, which was previously masked by body posture tuning. Once established, our framework can be efficiently applied to large datasets while minimizing the experimental workload caused by animal training and manual labeling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Limited Evidence for a Triple Dissociation in the Medial Temporal Lobe: an fMRI Recognition Memory Replication Study</a></h4>

              
                Common research practices in neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging may produce outcomes that are difficult to replicate. Results that cannot be replicated have contributed to a replication crisis in psychology, neuroscience, and other disciplines over the years. Here we replicate two previous papers in which the authors present two analysis paths for a dataset in which participants underwent fMRI while performing a recognition memory test for old and new words. Both studies found activation in the hippocampus, with the first demonstrating a distinction in hippocampal activation corresponding to true and perceived oldness of stimuli and the second demonstrating that hippocampal activation reflects the subjective experience of the participant. We replicated the behavioral and MRI acquisition parameters reported in the two target articles (Daselaar, Fleck, & Cabeza, 2006; Daselaar, Fleck, Prince, et al., 2006) with N=53 participants. We focused fMRI analyses on regions of interest reported in the target articles examining fMRI activation for differences corresponding with true and perceived oldness and those associated with the subjective memory experiences of recollection, familiarity, and novelty. Comparisons between true and perceived oldness revealed main effects not only for true, but also perceived oldness along with significant interaction effects. We replicate the findings of recollection and familiarity signals in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe cortex, respectively, but failed to replicate a novelty signal in the anterior medial temporal lobe. These results remained when we analyzed only correct trials, indicating that the effects were not due to selectively averaging correct and incorrect trials. Taken together, we replicate the previous finding that activation in the hippocampus corresponds to the subjective experience associated with correct recognition memory retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tumor necrosis factor α modulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in a concentration-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, have been implicated in important brain functions, such as synaptic transmission and plasticity. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), which is produced and secreted by microglia, has been linked to the expression of synaptic plasticity in neurons. However, the role of TNF-mediated activation of microglia has not been addressed in this context. Here, we assessed concentration-dependent effects of TNF on the balance of synaptic excitation/inhibition and the activation of microglia using mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures. We found that low concentrations of TNF enhanced excitatory synaptic strength while not affecting inhibitory neurotransmission. At higher concentrations, TNF increased inhibitory neurotransmission without affecting excitatory synaptic strength. Both low and high concentrations of TNF induced the synaptic accumulation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors, suggesting that a high concentration of TNF exerts a homeostatic effect on excitatory neurotransmission that prevents synaptic strengthening. Consistent with this, high, but not low, concentrations of TNF activated microglia. Moreover, high concentrations of TNF enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in microglia-depleted tissue cultures. These findings extend our knowledge on the role of TNF on synaptic plasticity by demonstrating concentration-dependent effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. They reveal a TNF-mediated negative feedback mechanism on excitatory neurotransmission that is dependent on the activation of microglia, thereby emphasizing their role as gatekeepers of TNF-mediated plasticity and homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down modulation and cortical-AMG/HPC interaction in familiar face processing</a></h4>

              
                Humans can accurately recognize familiar faces in only a few hundred milliseconds, but the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we recorded intracranial electrophysiological signals from ventral temporal cortex (VTC), superior/middle temporal cortex (STC/MTC), medial parietal cortex (MPC) and amygdala/hippocampus (AMG/HPC) in 20 epilepsy patients while they viewed faces of famous people and strangers as well as common objects. In posterior VTC and MPC, familiarity-sensitive responses emerged significantly later than initial face-selective responses, suggesting that familiarity enhances face representations after they are first being extracted. Moreover, viewing famous faces increased the coupling between cortical areas and AMG/HPC in multiple frequency bands. These findings imply that the top-down modulation in local face-selective response and interactions between cortical face areas and AMG/HPC contribute to the superior recognition of familiar faces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arousal neurons that anticipate deviations in blood glucose.</a></h4>

              
                The brain needs to track body energy state to optimize physiology and behavior. Important information about current and future energy states is contained in minute-to-minute fluctuations in blood glucose. However, it is unclear whether brain glucose sensors are capable of responding to this temporal structure to extract such information. In behaving mammals, hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons (HONs) control arousal and are proposed to sense energy balance, yet recent studies show that HON activity varies rapidly (over seconds) with locomotion. It remains unknown if and how HONs reflect blood glucose fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we co-monitored HON activity and blood glucose in behaving mice, uncovering inhibition of HONs by rising blood glucose. Surprisingly, peak HON signals (population waves) anticipated peak glucose deviations by several minutes. In multivariate analysis of diverse HON activity correlates (locomotion, metabolic variables), the glucose temporal gradient (negative first derivative) emerged as prime predictor of HON population activity on the minute timescales, thereby explaining this anticipatory response. Furthermore, 2-photon imaging of >900 individual HONs revealed parallel communication of absolute blood glucose values and their derivatives in distinct HON subsets. Thus, HONs transmit multiplexed slowly and rapidly changing information, and, in the slow bandwidth, extract temporal features from blood glucose dynamics that suggest a hybrid of anticipatory and proportional logic in brain responses to blood glucose.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What the hippocampus tells the HPA axis: Hippocampal output attenuates acute stress responses via disynaptic inhibition of CRF+ PVN neurons</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus exerts inhibitory feedback on the release of glucocorticoids. Because the major hippocampal efferent projections are excitatory, it has been hypothesized that this feedback inhibition is mediated by populations of inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus or elsewhere. These regions would be excited by hippocampal efferents and project to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). A direct demonstration of the synaptic responses elicited by hippocampal outputs in PVN cells or upstream GABAergic interneurons has not been provided previously. Here, we used viral vectors to express channelrhodopsin (ChR) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) in pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus (vHip) in mice expressing tdTomato in GABA- or CRF-expressing neurons. We observed dense innervation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) by labelled vHip axons and sparse labeling within the PVN. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording in parasagittal brain slices containing the BNST and PVN, photostimulation of vHip terminals elicited monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSCs) in both CRF+ and GAD+ cells. The balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition were maintained in CRF+ cells during 20 Hz stimulus trains. Photostimulation of hippocampal afferents to the BNST and PVN in vivo inhibited the rise in blood glucocorticoid levels produced by acute restraint stress. We thus provide functional evidence that hippocampal output to the BNST results in a net inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gaining further mechanistic insights into this process using methods with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution.

                Vocal communication in both songbirds and humans relies on categorical perception of smoothly varying acoustic spaces. Vocal perception can be biased by expectation and context, but the mechanisms of this bias are not well understood. We developed a behavioral task in which songbirds, European starlings, are trained to to classify smoothly varying song syllables in the context of predictive syllable sequences. We find that syllable-sequence predictability biases perceptual categorization following a Bayesian model of probabilistic information integration. We then recorded from populations of neurons in the auditory forebrain while birds actively categorized song syllables, observing large proportions of neurons that track the smoothly varying natural feature space of syllable categories. We observe that predictive information in the syllable sequences dynamically modulates sensory neural representations. These results support a Bayesian model of perception where predictive information acts to dynamically reallocate sensory neural resources, sharpening acuity (i.e. the likelihood) in high-probability regions of stimulus space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid microglial phenotype changes modulate neuronal networks and sharp wave-ripple activity in acute slice preparations</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have long been known for their remarkable sensitivity to tissue disturbance or injury, but its implications to the interpretation of results from ex vivo models of the CNS have remained largely unclear to date. To this end, we have followed the course of microglial phenotype changes and contribution to neuronal network organisation and functioning in acute brain slices prepared from mice, widely used to study the physiology of the brain from nanoscale events to complex circuits. We found that upon acute slice preparation, microglial cell bodies dislocate and migrate towards the surface of slices, alongside with rapidly progressing morphological changes and altered interactions with neurons. This is accompanied by gradual depolarization and downregulation of P2Y12 receptors, which are instrumental for microglia-neuron communication. Quantitative post-embedding immunofluorescent labelling reveals time-dependent increase in the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses upon slice preparation in the cerebral cortex, which are markedly influenced by microglia. In line with this, the absence of microglia diminishes the incidence, amplitude and frequency of sharp wave-ripple activity in hippocampal slices. Collectively, our data suggest that microglia are not only inherent modulators of complex neuronal networks, but their specific actions on network reorganisation and functioning must be taken into account when learning lessons from ex vivo models of the CNS.

	<p>The time-sensitive GABA shift from excitatory to inhibitory is critical in early neural circuits development and depends upon developmentally regulated expression of cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2. NKCC1, encoded by the SLC12A2 gene, regulates neuronal Cl&amp;amp;minus; homeostasis by chloride import working opposite KCC2. The high NKCC1/KCC2 expression ratio decreases in early neural development contributing to GABA shift. Human SLC12A2 loss-of-function mutations were recently associated with a multisystem disorder affecting neural development. However, the multisystem phenotype of rodent Nkcc1 knockout models makes neurodevelopment challenging to study. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)-NTRK2/TrkB signalling controls KCC2 expression during neural development, but its impact on NKCC1 is still controversial. Here, we discuss recent evidence supporting BDNF-TrkB signalling controlling Nkcc1 expression and the GABA shift during hippocampal circuit formation. Namely, specific deletion of Ntrk2/Trkb from immature mouse hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) affects their integration and maturation in the hippocampal circuitry and reduces Nkcc1 expression in their target region, the CA3 principal cells, leading to premature GABA shift, ultimately influencing the establishment of functional hippocampal circuitry and animal behaviour in adulthood. Thus, immature DGCs emerge as a potential therapeutic target as GABAergic transmission is vital for specific neural progenitors generating dentate neurogenesis in early development and the mature brain.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) research has shown great outcome variability in motor performance tasks, with one possible source being sex differences. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of estrogen levels on leg muscle fatigability during a fatigue task (FT) after 4 mA tDCS over the left motor cortex (M1). Ten young, healthy eumenorrheic women received 4 mA anodal active or sham stimulation over the left M1 during periods of high and low estrogen levels. A fatigue index (FI) was calculated to quantify fatigability, and the electromyography (EMG) of the knee extensors and flexors was recorded during the FT. The findings showed that tDCS applied during high estrogen levels resulted in greater leg muscle fatigability. Furthermore, a significant increase in EMG activity of the right knee extensors was observed during periods of active stimulation, independent of estrogen level. These results suggest that estrogen levels should be considered in tDCS studies with young healthy women.</p>

	<p>A major malignant trait of gliomas is their remarkable infiltration capacity. When glioma develops, the tumor cells have already reached the distant part. Therefore, complete removal of the glioma is impossible. Recently, research on the involvement of the tumor microenvironment in glioma invasion has advanced. Local hypoxia triggers cell migration as an environmental factor. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) -1&amp;amp;alpha;, produced in tumor cells under hypoxia, promotes the transcription of various invasion related molecules. The extracellular matrix surrounding tumors is degraded by proteases secreted by tumor cells and simultaneously replaced by an extracellular matrix that promotes infiltration. Astrocytes and microglia become tumor-associated astrocytes and glioma-associated macrophages/microglia, respectively, in relation to tumor cells. These cells also promote glioma invasion. Interactions between glioma cells actively promote infiltration of each other. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy transform the microenvironment, allowing glioma cells to invade. These findings indicate that the tumor microenvironment may be a target for glioma invasion. On the other hand, because the living body actively promotes tumor infiltration in response to the tumor, it is necessary to reconsider whether the invasion itself is friend or foe to the brain.</p>

	<p>Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGGs) are heterogeneous and poorly circumscribed neoplasms with isolated tumor cells that extend beyond the margins of the lesion depicted on MRI. Efforts to demarcate the glioma core from the surrounding healthy brain led us to define an intermediate region, the so-called peritumoral zone (PTZ). Although most studies about PTZ have been conducted on high-grade gliomas, the purpose here is to review the cellular, metabolic, and radiological characteristics of PTZ in the specific context of DLGG. A better delineation of PTZ, in which glioma cells and neural tissue strongly interact, may open new therapeutic avenues to optimize both functional and oncological results. First, a connectome-based &amp;amp;ldquo;supratotal&amp;amp;rdquo; surgical resection (i.e., with the removal of PTZ in addition to the tumor core) resulted in prolonged survival by limiting the risk of malignant transformation, while improving the quality of life, thanks to a better control of seizures. Second, the timing and order of (neo)adjuvant medical treatments can be modulated according to the pattern of peritumoral infiltration. Third, the development of new drugs specifically targeting the PTZ could be considered from an oncological (such as immunotherapy) and epileptological perspective. Further multimodal investigations of PTZ are needed to maximize long-term outcomes in DLGG patients.</p>

	<p>Psychosocial interventions targeting the specific needs of people affected by younger-onset dementia are lacking. Younger-onset dementia refers to dementia where symptom onset occurs at less than 65 years old. Because of its occurrence in middle age, the impact on spouses is particularly marked and dyadic-based interventions are recommended. Music And Psychology &amp;amp;amp; Social Connections (MAPS) is a novel online intervention, informed by the theory of adaptive coping by Bannon et al. (2021) for dyads affected by younger-onset dementia. MAPS combines therapeutic songwriting, cognitive behaviour therapy, and a private social networking group that focuses on the dyads. This will be a randomised controlled trial with a waitlist control. The primary aims are to assess whether MAPS improves depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in caregivers, with secondary aims to assess whether MAPS improves depressive symptoms in people with younger-onset dementia. The trial also aims to assess dyadic social connectedness; caregiver coping skills; and neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with younger-onset dementia. We will recruit 60 dyads to participate in a group-based weekly online program for 8 weeks facilitated by a credentialed music therapist and psychologist. Sessions 1 and 8 will include both caregivers and people with younger-onset dementia and Sessions 2&amp;amp;ndash;7 will involve separate group sessions for caregivers and those with dementia. There will be focus groups for qualitative feedback. Due to its online administration, MAPS has the potential to reach many dyads affected by younger-onset dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A general framework for predicting the transcriptomic consequences of non-coding variation and small molecules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moustafa Abdalla, Mohamed Abdalla</p>

Genome wide association studies (GWASs) for complex traits have implicated thousands of genetic loci. Most GWAS-nominated variants lie in noncoding regions, complicating the systematic translation of these findings into functional understanding. Here, we leverage convolutional neural networks to assist in this challenge. Our computational framework, peaBrain, models the transcriptional machinery of a tissue as a two-stage process: first, predicting the mean tissue specific abundance of all genes and second, incorporating the transcriptomic consequences of genotype variation to predict individual abundance on a subject-by-subject basis. We demonstrate that peaBrain accounts for the majority (>50%) of variance observed in mean transcript abundance across most tissues and outperforms regularized linear models in predicting the consequences of individual genotype variation. We highlight the validity of the peaBrain model by calculating non-coding impact scores that correlate with nucleotide evolutionary constraint that are also predictive of disease-associated variation and allele-specific transcription factor binding. We further show how these tissue-specific peaBrain scores can be leveraged to pinpoint functional tissues underlying complex traits, outperforming methods that depend on colocalization of eQTL and GWAS signals. We subsequently: (a) derive continuous dense embeddings of genes for downstream applications; (b) highlight the utility of the model in predicting transcriptomic impact of small molecules and shRNA (on par with <i>in vitro</i> experimental replication of external test sets); (c) explore how peaBrain can be used to model difficult-to-study processes (such as neural induction); and (d) identify putatively functional eQTLs that are missed by high-throughput experimental approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting recurrent waves of pertussis across the boroughs of London</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arash Saeidpour, Shweta Bansal, Pejman Rohani</p>

Pertussis has resurfaced in the UK, with incidence levels not seen since the 1980s. While the fundamental causes of this resurgence remain the subject of much conjecture, the study of historical patterns of pathogen diffusion can be illuminating. Here, we examined time series of pertussis incidence in the boroughs of Greater London from 1982 to 2013 to document the spatial epidemiology of this bacterial infection and to identify the potential drivers of its percolation. The incidence of pertussis over this period is characterized by 3 distinct stages: a period exhibiting declining trends with 4-year inter-epidemic cycles from 1982 to 1994, followed by a deep trough until 2006 and the subsequent resurgence. We observed systematic temporal trends in the age distribution of cases and the fade-out profile of pertussis coincident with increasing national vaccine coverage from 1982 to 1990. To quantify the hierarchy of epidemic phases across the boroughs of London, we used the Hilbert transform. We report a consistent pattern of spatial organization from 1982 to the early 1990s, with some boroughs consistently leading epidemic waves and others routinely lagging. To determine the potential drivers of these geographic patterns, a comprehensive parallel database of borough-specific features was compiled, comprising of demographic, movement and socio-economic factors that were used in statistical analyses to predict epidemic phase relationships among boroughs. Specifically, we used a combination of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to quantify the contribution of each covariate to model predictions. Our analyses identified a number of predictors of a borough’s historical epidemic phase, specifically the age composition of households, the number of agricultural and skilled manual workers, latitude, the population of public transport commuters and high-occupancy households. Univariate regression analysis of the 2012 epidemic identified the ratio of cumulative unvaccinated children to the total population and population of Pakistan-born population to have moderate positive and negative association, respectively, with the timing of epidemic. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of contemporary pertussis transmission in a large metropolitan population, this study has identified the characteristics that determine the spatial spread of this bacterium across the boroughs of London.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Benchmarking of deep learning algorithms for 3D instance segmentation of confocal image datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anuradha Kar, Manuel Petit, Yassin Refahi, Guillaume Cerutti, Christophe Godin, Jan Traas</p>

Segmenting three-dimensional (3D) microscopy images is essential for understanding phenomena like morphogenesis, cell division, cellular growth, and genetic expression patterns. Recently, deep learning (DL) pipelines have been developed, which claim to provide high accuracy segmentation of cellular images and are increasingly considered as the state of the art for image segmentation problems. However, it remains difficult to define their relative performances as the concurrent diversity and lack of uniform evaluation strategies makes it difficult to know how their results compare. In this paper, we first made an inventory of the available DL methods for 3D cell segmentation. We next implemented and quantitatively compared a number of representative DL pipelines, alongside a highly efficient non-DL method named MARS. The DL methods were trained on a common dataset of 3D cellular confocal microscopy images. Their segmentation accuracies were also tested in the presence of different image artifacts. A specific method for segmentation quality evaluation was adopted, which isolates segmentation errors due to under- or oversegmentation. This is complemented with a 3D visualization strategy for interactive exploration of segmentation quality. Our analysis shows that the DL pipelines have different levels of accuracy. Two of them, which are end-to-end 3D and were originally designed for cell boundary detection, show high performance and offer clear advantages in terms of adaptability to new data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Biosecurity in an age of open science</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Andrew Smith, Jonas B. Sandbrink</p>

The risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of biological research is increasing as biotechnology advances. As open science becomes widespread, we must consider its impact on those risks and develop solutions that ensure security while facilitating scientific progress. Here, we examine the interaction between open science practices and biosecurity and biosafety to identify risks and opportunities for risk mitigation. Increasing the availability of computational tools, datasets, and protocols could increase risks from research with misuse potential. For instance, in the context of viral engineering, open code, data, and materials may increase the risk of release of enhanced pathogens. For this dangerous subset of research, both open science and biosecurity goals may be achieved by using access-controlled repositories or application programming interfaces. While preprints accelerate dissemination of findings, their increased use could challenge strategies for risk mitigation at the publication stage. This highlights the importance of oversight earlier in the research lifecycle. Preregistration of research, a practice promoted by the open science community, provides an opportunity for achieving biosecurity risk assessment at the conception of research. Open science and biosecurity experts have an important role to play in enabling responsible research with maximal societal benefit.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Structures of Omicron Spike complexes and implications for neutralizing antibody development</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is dominant in many countries worldwide. The high number of Spike mutations is responsible for the broad immune evasion from existing vaccines and antibody drugs. To understand this, we first present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Spike. Comparison to previous Spike-antibody structures explains how Omicron escapes these therapeutics. Secondly, we report structures of Omicron, Delta and WT Spikes bound to a patient-derived Fab antibody fragment (510A5), which provides direct evidence where antibody binding was greatly attenuated by the Omicron mutations, freeing Spike to bind ACE2.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine elicits monoclonal antibodies with potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants</a></h4>

              
                Seow et al. isolate antibodies following double vaccination with AZD1222. Isolated antibodies target epitopes overlapping with the epitopes of infection-derived antibodies and show potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. Despite low serum neutralization at 9 months post vaccine, Spike reactive B cells are detected.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">SARS-CoV-2 variants C.1.2 and B.1.621 (Mu) partially evade neutralization by antibodies elicited upon infection or vaccination</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 variants C.1.2 and B.1.621 (Mu) rapidly spread in Africa and the Americas, respectively. Arora et el. show that C.1.2 and B.1.621 spike proteins enable increased entry into certain cell lines, are resistant to neutralization by the therapeutic antibody Bamlanivimab and partially escape neutralization by infection- or vaccination-induced antibodies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Probing the segregation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission via photobleaching and recovery of a fluorescent glutamate sensor</a></h4>

              
                Synapses maintain both action potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, however, organization of these two forms of release within an individual synapse remains unclear. Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release in primary hippocampal cultures. In non-neuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of non-photobleached probes with a time constant of 10 seconds. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Measurements and simulations of microtubule growth imply strong longitudinal interactions and reveal a role for GDP on the elongating end</a></h4>

              
                Microtubule polymerization dynamics result from the biochemical interactions of αβ-tubulin with the polymer end, but a quantitative understanding has been challenging to establish. We used interference reflection microscopy to make improved measurements of microtubule growth rates and growth fluctuations in the presence and absence of GTP hydrolysis. In the absence of GTP hydrolysis, microtubules grew steadily with very low fluctuations. These data were best described by a computational model implementing slow assembly kinetics, such that the rate of microtubule elongation is primarily limited by the rate of αβ-tubulin associations. With GTPase present, microtubules displayed substantially larger growth fluctuations than expected based on the no GTPase measurements. Our modeling showed that these larger fluctuations occurred because exposure of GDP-tubulin on the microtubule end transiently 'poisoned' growth, yielding a wider range of growth rates compared to GTP only conditions. Our experiments and modeling point to slow association kinetics (strong longitudinal interactions), such that drugs and regulatory proteins that alter microtubule dynamics could do so by modulating either the association or dissociation rate of tubulin from the microtubule tip. By causing slower growth, exposure of GDP tubulin at the growing microtubule end may be an important early event determining catastrophe.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-range migration of centrioles to the apical surface of the olfactory epithelium</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in vertebrates detect odorants using multiple cilia, which protrude from the end of the dendrite and require centrioles for their formation. In mouse olfactory epithelium, the centrioles originate in progenitor cells near the basal lamina, often 50 to 100 μm from the apical surface. It is unknown how centrioles traverse this distance or mature to form cilia. Using high-resolution expansion microscopy, we found that centrioles migrate together, with multiple centrioles per group and multiple groups per OSN, during dendrite outgrowth. Centrioles were found by live imaging to migrate slowly, with a maximum rate of 0.18 µm/min. Centrioles in migrating groups were associated with microtubule nucleation factors, but acquired rootletin and appendages only in mature OSNs. The parental centriole had preexisting appendages, formed a single cilium before other centrioles, and retained its unique appendage configuration in the mature OSN. We developed an air-liquid interface explant culture system for OSNs and used it to show that centriole migration can be perturbed <i>ex vivo</i> by stabilizing microtubules. We consider these results in the context of a comprehensive model for centriole formation, migration, and maturation in this important sensory cell type.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Calsyntenin-3, an atypical cadherin, suppresses inhibitory synapses but increases excitatory parallel-fiber synapses in cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Cadherins contribute to the organization of nearly all tissues, but the functions of several evolutionarily conserved cadherins, including those of calsyntenins, remain enigmatic. Puzzlingly, two distinct, non-overlapping functions for calsyntenins were proposed: As postsynaptic neurexin ligands in synapse formation, or as presynaptic kinesin adaptors in vesicular transport. Here, we show that, surprisingly, acute CRISPR-mediated deletion of calsyntenin-3 in mouse cerebellum <i>in vivo</i> causes a large decrease in inhibitory synapse, but a robust increase in excitatory parallel-fiber synapses in Purkinje cells. As a result, inhibitory synaptic transmission was suppressed, whereas parallel-fiber synaptic transmission was enhanced in Purkinje cells by the calsyntenin-3 deletion. No changes in the dendritic architecture of Purkinje cells or in climbing-fiber synapses were detected. Sparse selective deletion of calsyntenin-3 only in Purkinje cells recapitulated the synaptic phenotype, indicating that calsyntenin-3 acts by a cell-autonomous postsynaptic mechanism in cerebellum. Thus, by promoting formation of excitatory parallel-fiber synapses and decreasing formation of inhibitory synapses in the same neuron, calsyntenin-3 functions as a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that regulates the excitatory/inhibitory balance in Purkinje cells.

                Preys use their memory - where they sensed a predatory threat and whether a safe shelter is nearby - to dynamically control their survival instinct to avoid harm and reach safety. However, it remains unknown which brain regions are involved, and how such top-down control of innate behaviour is implemented at the circuit level. Here, using adult male mice, we show that the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is best positioned to control this task as an exclusive target of the hippocampus (HPC) within the medial hypothalamic defense system. Selective optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of hippocampal inputs to the AHN revealed that the HPC→AHN pathway not only mediates the contextual memory of predator threats but also controls the goal-directed escape by transmitting information about the surrounding environment. These results reveal a new mechanism for experience-dependent, top-down control of innate defensive behaviours.

                BackgroundPneumococcal meningitis, inflammation of the meninges due to an infection of the Central Nervous System caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), is the most common form of community-acquired bacterial meningitis globally. The brain is separated from the systemic circulation by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and meningitis triggers the host immune response increasing the BBB permeability, allowing peripheral immune cells to reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and increasing debris production. The glymphatic system is a glial-dependent clearance pathway that drives the exchange of compounds between the brain parenchyma and the CSF regulating the waste clearance away from the brain. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-water channels on astrocytic end feet regulate the solute transport of the glymphatic system.

MethodsWistar rats, either subjected to pneumococcal meningitis or to artificial-CSF (sham), received Evans blue albumin (EBA) intracisternal. Overall, the meningitis group presented a significant impairment of the glymphatic system by retaining the EBA in the brain without consistently releasing the EBA into the bloodstream compared to the sham non-infected group. Through western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis using rat CSF and brain tissue sections, an increased accumulation of pneumococci was detected over time in the CSF, and because of a loss of drainage between CSF and brain interstitial space, such bacterial accumulation was not observed in the brain parenchyma. Western blot analysis for Iba1, TMEM119 and IFN-{gamma} in rat brain homogenates and NSE in serum showed increased neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in the brain over time during pneumococcal infection. Neurological impairment upon neuronal cell damage caused by meningitis with a malfunctioning glymphatic system was also demonstrated through open-field behavioral tests comparing rats from sham and meningitis groups. Lastly, protein expression analysis of AQP4 revealed no differences in AQP4 between the brains of the rats from the meningitis group and those from the sham non-infected rats. Importantly, confocal microscopy analysis showed a detachment of the astrocytic end feet from the BBB vascular endothelium with consequent misplacement of AQP4-water channels.

ConclusionsThese findings clearly indicate that pneumococcal meningitis decreases the glymphatic systems functionality, increasing the neurotoxic waste debris in the brain ultimately leading to brain-wide neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Finally, our results clearly showed that during pneumococcal meningitis, the glymphatic system does not function because of a detachment of the astrocytic end feet from the BBB vascular endothelium, which leads to a misplacement of AQP4 with consequent the loss of the AQP4-water channels functionality.

However, for biological creatures the  reward function can fluctuate substantially over time depending on the internal physiological state of the animal. For instance, food is rewarding when you are hungry, but not when you are satiated. While a variety of experiments have demonstrated that animals can instantly adapt their behaviour when their internal physiological state changes, under current thinking this requires model-based planning since the standard model of TD learning requires retraining from scratch if the reward function changes. Here, we propose a novel and simple extension to TD learning that allows for the zero-shot (instantaneous) generalization to changing reward functions. Mathematically, we show that if we assume the reward function is a linear combination of reward basis vectors, and if we learn a value function for each reward basis using TD learning, then we can recover the true value function by a linear combination of these value function bases. This representational scheme allows instant and perfect generalization to any reward function in the span of the reward basis vectors as well as possesses a straightforward implementation in neural circuitry by parallelizing the standard circuitry required for TD learning. We demonstrate that our algorithm can also reproduce behavioural data on reward revaluation tasks, predict dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens, as well as learn equally fast as successor representations while requiring much less memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute administration of a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist alters behavioral and neural parameters in adult zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is involved in numerous brain functions and behavioral processes. Alterations in this neurotransmitter system are associated with the pathogenesis of several human neurological disorders. Pharmacological agents that interact with the dopaminergic system allow the investigation of dopamine-mediated cellular and molecular responses and may elucidate the biological bases of such disorders. The zebrafish, a translationally relevant biomedical research organism, has been successfully employed in prior psychopharmacology studies. Here, we evaluate the effects of quinpirole (a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist) in adult zebrafish on behavioral parameters and neurotransmitter levels. Adult zebrafish received intraperitoneal injections of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of quinpirole or saline (control group) twice with an inter-injection interval of 48h. All tests were performed 24h after the second injection. After acute quinpirole administration, zebrafish exhibited decreased locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like behaviors and memory impairment compared to control. However, the quinpirole administration did not affect social and aggressive behavior. Quinpirole-treated fish exhibited altered swimming patterns: fish showed stereotypic swimming characterized by repetitive behavior, swimming from corner to corner at the bottom of the tank preceded and followed by episodes of immobility. Moreover, analysis of neurotransmitter levels in the brain demonstrated a significant increase in glutamate and a decrease in serotonin, while no alterations were observed in dopamine. These findings demonstrate that dopaminergic signaling altered by quinpirole administration results in significant changes in behavior and neurotransmitter levels in the central nervous system of zebrafish. Thus, we conclude that the use of quinpirole administration in adult zebrafish may be an appropriate tool for the analysis of mechanisms underlying neurological disorders related to the dopaminergic system.

                Attention mechanisms are one of the most frequently used architectures in the development of artificial intelligence because they can process contextual information efficiently. Various artificial intelligence mechanisms such as transformer for processing natural language, image data, etc. include the attention mechanism. Since attention is a powerful component to realize artificial intelligence, various improvements have been made to enhance its performance. The time complexity of attention depends on the square of input sequence length. Methods to improve time complexity of attention are one of the hottest topics in various studies. In this study, we have devised a mechanism called relation that can understand the context information of sequential data without using attention. Relation is very simple to implement and its time complexity depends only on the length of the sequences; a comparison of the performance of neural networks with relation and attention mechanisms on several benchmark datasets shows that relation achieved the same context processing capability as attention with less computation time. Hence, relation is an ideal option for processing context information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictable fluctuations in excitatory synaptic strength due to natural variation in presynaptic firing rate</a></h4>

              
                Many controlled, in vitro studies have demonstrated how postsynaptic responses to presynaptic spikes are not constant but depend on short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) and the detailed timing of presynaptic spikes. However, the effects of short-term plasticity (depression and facilitation) are not limited to short, sub-second timescales. The effects of STP appear on long timescales as changes in presynaptic firing rates lead to changes in steady-state synaptic transmission. Here we examine the relationship between natural variations in the presynaptic firing rates and spike transmission in vivo. Using large-scale spike recordings in awake mice from the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset, we first detect putative excitatory synaptic connections based on cross-correlations between the spike trains of millions of pairs of neurons. For the subset of pairs where a transient, excitatory effect was detected, we use a model-based approach to track fluctuations in synaptic efficacy and find that efficacy varies substantially on slow (~1 minute) timescales over the course of these recordings. For many connections, the efficacy fluctuations are correlated with fluctuations in the presynaptic firing rate. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, we then model the detailed probability of postsynaptic spiking on a millisecond timescale, including both slow changes in postsynaptic excitability and monosynaptic inputs with short-term plasticity. The detailed model reproduces the slow efficacy fluctuations observed with many putative excitatory connections, suggesting that these fluctuations can be both directly predicted based on the time-varying presynaptic firing rate and, at least partly, explained by the cumulative effects of STP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glossiness perception and its pupillary response</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have discovered that pupillary response changes depend on cognitive factors, such as subjective brightness caused by optical illusions and luminance. However, it remains unclear how the cognitive factor derived from the glossiness perception of object surfaces affects pupillary response. We investigated the relationship between glossiness perception and pupillary response through a gloss rating experiment that includes recording pupil diameter. For the stimuli, we prepared general object images (original) and randomized images (shuffled) that comprised of the same images with randomized small square regions. The image features were then controlled by matching the luminance histogram. The observers were asked to rate the perceived glossiness of the stimuli presented for 3,000 ms and changes in their pupil diameter were recorded. Consequently, if glossiness of the original images were rated as high, those of the shuffled were rated as low, and vice versa. High-gloss images constricted the pupil size more than the low-gloss ones near the pupillary light reflex. By contrast, the shuffled images dilated the pupil size more than the original image at a relatively later stage. These results suggest that local features comprising specular highlights involve the cognitive factor for pupil constriction, and this process is faster than pupil dilation derived from the inhibition of object recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Computational Neuroanatomy of Predictive Dynamics of Pain Perception</a></h4>

              
                Pain perception is an active process that regulates nociceptive inputs by descending opioidergic signals, in which the brain encodes pain-related predictive and corrective terms, after having made Bayesian-like inferences about noxious amplitudes. Offset analgesia (OA), a large reduction of tonic pain after a small nociceptive termination, is typical empirical evidence of on-line pain modulation through prediction and its correction. However, the basic computational structure underlying OA is not understood. Here, we adopted a constructive approach, formulated the inference of noxious amplitudes with a Kalman filter model, i.e., a recursive Bayesian computation, and then deduced the computational structure for OA, in which an interaction between two latent state variables was implemented. Simulation results suggested that the unidirectional interaction of the two states with two dissociable roles (an integral over time and a derivative of stimulus changes) is crucial for OA. Our results, combined with previous anatomical studies, suggest a computational basis of neural connectivity for pain. The ACC and aINS interact to compute a descending prediction to the brainstem, i.e. PAG, while ascending inputs are filtered in the thalamus and delivered to the cortices as prediction errors. Thus, we suggest dissociable, computational roles of the ACC and aINS in pain processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Third Somatomotor Representation in the Human Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Seminal neurophysiological studies in the 1940s discovered two somatomotor maps in the cerebellum - an inverted anterior lobe map and an upright posterior lobe map. Both maps have been confirmed in the human using non-invasive neuroimaging with additional hints of a third map near to the cerebellar vermis. Here we sought direct evidence for the third somatomotor map by using intensive, repeated functional MRI (fMRI) scanning of individuals performing movements across multiple body parts (tongue, hands, glutes and feet). An initial discovery sample (N=4, 4 sessions per individual including 576 separate blocks of body movements) yielded evidence for the two established cerebellar somatomotor maps, as well as evidence for a third discontinuous foot representation near to the vermis. When the left versus right foot movements were directly contrasted, the third representation could be clearly distinguished from the second representation in multiple individuals. Functional connectivity from seed regions in the third somatomotor representation confirmed anatomically-specific connectivity with the cortex, paralleling the patterns observed for the two well-established maps. All results were prospectively replicated in an independent dataset with new individuals (N=4). These collective findings provide direct support for a third somatomotor map in the vermis of the cerebellum. We discuss the relations of this candidate third map to the broader topography of the cerebellum as well as its implications for understanding the specific organization of the human cerebellar vermis where distinct zones appear functionally specialized for somatomotor and visual domains.

                Automatic neuroimaging segmentation and parcellation tools provide convenient and systematic methods for extracting numerous features from brain MRI scans, and are becoming standard practice for large-scale coordinated studies. One such tool, FreeSurfer, provides an easy-to-use pipeline to extract metrics describing cortical and subcortical morphometry. Over the past two decades, there have been over 25 stable releases of FreeSurfer, and different versions are used across published works. Despite this, the reliability and compatibility of metrics derived from the most recent major version releases have yet to be assessed empirically. Here, we use test-retest data from three public brain MRI datasets to assess within-version reliability and between-version compatibility across 42 regional outputs from three versions of FreeSurfer: the latest, v7.1, and two previous stable releases - v5.3, and v6.0. We find v7.1 was less compatible with older versions for measuring cortical thickness. In particular, the thickness of the cingulate gyrus had low compatibility (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between 0.37 and 0.61) between versions. Temporal and frontal poles, and the medial orbitofrontal surface area metrics, also showed low to moderate compatibility with v7.1. While our work compares all three versions, our sub-comparisons between the older versions (v5.3 and v6.0) replicates earlier findings of low compatibility of pallidum and putamen volumes. Low between-version compatibility was not always indicative of low within-version reliability - all versions showed good to excellent reliability across most regional measures (ICC>0.8). Age associations, quality control metrics, and Dice coefficients in an independent sample of 106 individual scans, processed with all three versions of FreeSurfer, revealed differences in results of downstream statistical analysis. As neuroimaging studies adopt more recently released software, we provide researchers with a reference to highlight the regions and metrics that may yield findings inconsistent with published works using older FreeSurfer software. An interactive viewer for the results is provided at http://data.brainescience.org/Freesurfer_Reliability/

                Although protein synthesis is hypothesized to have a pivotal role in axonal repair after central nervous system (CNS) injury, the role of core components of the protein synthesis machinery has not been examined. Notably, some elongation factors possess non-canonical functions that may further impact axonal repair. Here, we examined whether overexpressing eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) proteins enhances the collateral sprouting of corticospinal tract (CST) neurons after unilateral pyramidotomy, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms. Compared with axonal regeneration from injured neurons, axonal sprouting from uninjured neurons occurs spontaneously after injury and may represent a more accessible form of axonal repair for clinical translation. We found that overexpressing eEF1A1, eEF1A2 or both proteins in CST neurons increased the levels of pS6, an indicator for mTOR activity, in neuronal somas. In contrast, the levels of pSTAT3 and pAKT were not increased. Strikingly, overexpressing eEF1A2 alone, but neither eEF1A1 alone nor both factors simultaneously, increased protein synthesis and actin rearrangement in CST neurons. While eEF1A1 overexpression only slightly enhanced CST sprouting across the midline into the denervated side in the cervical spinal after pyramidotomy, eEF1A2 overexpression substantially enhanced this sprouting. Surprisingly, co-overexpression of both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 led to a sprouting phenotype similar to wild-type controls, suggesting an antagonistic effect of overexpressing both proteins. These data provide the first evidence that overexpressing a core component of the translation machinery, eEF1A2, enhances CST sprouting, likely by a combination of increased protein synthesis, mTOR signaling and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.

                To better understand complex human phenotypes, large-scale studies have increasingly collected multiple data modalities across domains such as imaging, mobile health, and physical activity. The properties of each data type often differ substantially and require either separate analyses or extensive processing to obtain comparable features for a combined analysis. Multimodal data fusion enables certain analyses on matrix-valued and vector-valued data, but it generally cannot integrate modalities of different dimensions and data structures. For a single data modality, multivariate distance matrix regression provides a distance-based framework for regression accommodating a wide range of data types. However, no distance-based method exists to handle multiple complementary types of data. We propose a novel distance-based regression model, which we refer to as Similarity-based Multimodal Regression (SiMMR), that enables simultaneous regression of multiple modalities through their distance profiles. We demonstrate through simulation, imaging studies, and longitudinal mobile health analyses that our proposed method can detect associations in multimodal data of differing properties and dimensionalities, even with modest sample sizes. We perform experiments to evaluate several different test statistics and provide recommendations for applying our method across a broad range of scenarios.

                Volumetric functional imaging is widely used for recording neuron activities in vivo, but there exist tradeoffs between the quality of the extracted calcium traces, imaging speed, and laser power. While deep-learning methods have recently been applied to denoise images, their applications to downstream analyses, such as recovering high-SNR calcium traces, have been limited. Further, these methods require temporally-linked pre-registered data with ultrafast rates. Here, we demonstrate supervised deep-denoising methods to circumvent these tradeoffs for several applications, including whole-brain imaging, large field-of-view imaging in freely moving animals, and recovering complex neurite structures in C. elegans. Our framework has 30x smaller memory footprint, and is fast in training and inference (50-70ms); it is highly accurate and generalizable, and further, only small, non-temporally-sequential, independently-acquired training datasets (~500 images) are needed. We envision that the framework will enable faster and long-term imaging experiments necessary to study neuronal mechanisms of many behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex and Basolateral Amygdala Regulate Sensitivity to Delayed Punishment during Decision-making</a></h4>

              
                In real-world decision-making scenarios, negative consequences do not always occur immediately after a choice. This delay between action and outcome drives the underestimation, or delay discounting, of punishment. While the neural substrates underlying sensitivity to immediate punishment have been well-studied, there has been minimal investigation of delayed consequences. Here, we assessed the role of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two regions implicated in cost/benefit decision-making, in sensitivity to delayed vs immediate punishment. The delayed punishment decision-making task (DPDT) was used to measure delay discounting of punishment in rodents. During DPDT, rats choose between a small, single pellet reward and a large, three pellet reward accompanied by a mild foot shock. As the task progresses, the shock is preceded by a delay that systematically increases or decreases throughout the session. We observed that rats avoid choices associated with immediate punishment, then shift preference toward these options when the punishment is delayed. LOFC inactivation did not influence choice of rewards with immediate punishment, but decreased choice of delayed punishment. We also found that BLA inactivation reduced choice of delayed punishment, but this was only evident when punishment was initially delivered immediately after a choice, then preceded by a delay as the task progressed. Therefore, both LOFC and BLA contribute to the delay discounting of punishment, and may serve as promising therapeutic targets to improve sensitivity to delayed punishment during decision-making.

                Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam1 into 38,016 isoforms provides neurons with a unique molecular code for self-recognition and self-avoidance. A canonical model suggests that homophilic binding of identical Dscam1 isoforms on sister branches of mushroom body (MB) axons supports segregation with high fidelity, even when only a single isoform is expressed. Here we generated a series of mutant flies with a single exon 4, 6, or 9 variant, encoding 1,584, 396, or 576 potential isoforms, respectively. Surprisingly, most of the mutants in the latter two groups exhibited obvious defects in the growth, branching, and segregation of MB axonal sister branches. This demonstrates that repertoires of 396 and 576 Dscam1 isoforms were not sufficient for normal patterning of axonal branches. Moreover, reducing Dscam1 levels largely reversed the defects caused by reduced isoform diversity, suggesting a functional link between Dscam1 expression levels and isoform diversity. Taken together, these results indicate that canonical self-avoidance alone does not explain the function of Dscam1 in MB axonal wiring.

                The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) exhibits choice-selective activity during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it is not known how this selective activity arises from the underlying synaptic connectivity. Here, we combined virtual reality behavior, two-photon calcium imaging, high throughput electron microscopy, and circuit modeling to analyze how synaptic connectivity between neurons in PPC relates to their selective activity. We found that excitatory pyramidal neurons preferentially target inhibitory interneurons with the same selectivity. In turn, inhibitory interneurons preferentially target pyramidal neurons with opposite selectivity, forming an opponent inhibition motif. Using circuit models, we show that opponent inhibition amplifies selective inputs and induces competition between neural populations with opposite selectivity, thereby improving the encoding of trial-type information. These results provide evidence for how synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits supports a learned decision-making task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cis mutagenesis in vivo reveals extensive noncanonical functions of Dscam1 isoforms in neuronal wiring</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila Dscam1 encodes ten thousand of cell recognition molecules via alternative splicing, which is required for nervous function. However, the underlying mechanism has not fully understood. Here we revealed extensive noncanonical functions of Dscam1 isoform diversity in neuronal wiring. We generated a series of allelic cis mutations in Dscam1, encoding normal number of isoforms albeit with altered isoform composition. Despite normal dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination in da neurons, which is consistent with canonical self-avoidance model, these mutants exhibited strikingly distinct spectra of phenotypic defects in three classes of neurons: up to ~60% defects in mushroom bodies, a significantly increased branching and growth in da neurons, and mild axonal branching defects in mechanosensory neurons. These data suggest that proper Dscam1 isoform composition is required for axon and dendrite growth in diverse neurons. This unprecedented splicing-tuned regulation unlocks new insights into the molecular mechanisms that Dscam1 isoform diversity is engaged in.

                Rationale. Obesity is a major health problem worldwide. An understanding of the factors that drive feeding behaviors is key to the development of pharmaceuticals to decrease appetite and consumption. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the melanocortin peptide precursor, is essential in the regulation of body weight and ingestive behaviors. Deletion of POMC or impairment of melanocortin signaling in the brain results in hyperphagic obesity. Neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus produce POMC and project to many areas including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which is well established in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of both food and drugs of abuse. Objective. These studies sought to determine the role of melanocortins in the NAcc on consumption of and motivation to obtain access to standard rodent chow. Methods. Male, C57BL/6J mice were microinjected bilaterally into the NAcc (100 nl/side) with the melanocortin receptor 3/4 agonist melanotan-II (MT-II; 0.1, 0.3, and 1 nmol), and ingestive behaviors were examined in both home cage and operant food self-administration experiments. In addition, the ability of MT-II in the NAcc to produce aversive properties or affect metabolic rate were tested. Results. MT-II injected into the NAcc significantly decreased consumption in both home cage and operant paradigms, and furthermore decreased appetitive responding to gain access to food. There was no development of conditioned taste avoidance or change in metabolic parameters following anorexic doses of MT-II. Conclusions. MT-II in the NAcc decreased both the motivation to eat and the amount of food consumed without inducing an aversive state or affecting metabolic rate, suggesting a role for melanocortin signaling in the ventral striatum that is selective for appetite and satiety without affecting metabolism or producing an aversive state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coding of reward uncertainty and probability by orexin neurons</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate arousal in our brains critically relies on hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons (HONs). HON activity regulation has been a subject of intense research, uncovering slow responses to nutrients and hormones, and fast responses to external sensory inputs. However, it remains unclear whether HONs also respond to statistical patterns in the environment. Among these, reward probability and uncertainty are fundamental measures of information that enable evaluation of predictions, and guide diverse aspects of cognition such as learning and motivation. Using different cues to denote reward likelihood across the full probability range (0-1) , we found that HON population responses to the reward-predicting cues co-vary with reward uncertainty. Single-cell analyses additionally revealed HON subsets specializing in monotonic representations of probability, as well as cells sharply tuned to uncertainty. Furthermore, simultaneous recordings of HONs and midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) indicated that HONs and DANs diverge in their coding of reward probability, both in responses to reward-predicting cues and to rewards. These results demonstrate previously unseen coding of reward expectation in genetically-defined hypothalamic cells central to clinical conditions and neurobehavioral physiology, and suggest a possible role for HONs in converting reward statistics into arousal-based allocation of cognitive and autonomic resources.

                Popular theories suggest that hallucinations arise through excessive top-down perceptual expectations, whereas others have emphasised the role of spontaneous bottom-up activity. These theories make different predictions about how input and feedback layers in sensory regions contribute to hallucinations. Here, we used layer-specific fMRI to interrogate neural activity underlying hallucinations - high confidence false percepts - and perceptual expectations while healthy participants (N=25) performed a perceptual discrimination task. We found that false percepts were related to stimulus-like activity in the middle input layers of V2. On the other hand, perceptual expectations activated the deep feedback layers of V2, without influencing perception. The prevalence of high confidence false percepts was related to everyday hallucination severity, confirming their ecological validity. These results reveal that hallucinations can arise through spontaneous stimulus-specific activity in the input layers of the visual cortex, independent of top-down perceptual expectations.

                Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) are widespread techniques to measure neural activity in vivo at a high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution. Locating the sources underlying the M/EEG poses an inverse problem, which is itself ill-posed. In recent years, a new class of source imaging methods was developed based on artificial neural networks. We present a long-short term memory (LSTM) network to solve the M/EEG inverse problem. It integrates several aspects essential for qualitative inverse solutions: Low computational cost, exploitation of both spatial and temporal information, input flexibility and robustness to noise. Using simulation data, the LSTM shows higher accuracy on multiple metrics and for varying numbers of neural sources, compared to classical inverse solutions but also compared to our alternative architectures without integration of temporal information. It successfully integrates the temporal context given by sequential data, which is particularly useful with noisy data. Real data of a median nerve stimulation paradigm was used to show that the LSTM predicts plausible sources that are in concordance with classical inverse solutions. The performance of the LSTM regarding its robustness to noise renders it a promising and easy-to-apply inverse solution to be considered in future source localization studies and for clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow oscillations promote long range effective communication: the key for memory consolidation in a broken down network</a></h4>

              
                One of the most prominent and robust findings in cognitive neuroscience is the strengthening of memories during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, with slow oscillations (SOs, < 1Hz) playing a critical role in systems-level consolidation. However, NREM is a sleep period generally showing a breakdown in connectivity and reduction of synaptic plasticity with increasing depth: a brain state seemingly unfavorable to memory consolidation. Here, we present a novel approach to address this apparent paradox that leverages an event-related causality measure to estimate directional information flow during NREM sleep in epochs with and without SOs. Our results confirm that NREM is generally a state of dampened neural communication, but reveals that SOs provide two windows of enhanced large-scale communication before and after the SO trough. These peaks in communication are significantly higher when SOs are coupled with sleep spindles, compared with uncoupled SOs. To probe the functional relevance of these SO-selective peaks of information flow, we tested the temporal and topographic conditions that predict overnight episodic memory improvement. Our results show that global, long-range communication during SOs promote sleep-dependent systems consolidation of episodic memories. A significant correlation between peaks of information flow and memory improvement lends a predictive validity to our measurements of effective connectivity. In other words, we were able to predict memory improvement on the basis of independent electrophysiological observations during sleep. This work introduces a non-invasive approach to understanding information processing during sleep, a behavioral stage whose function, until now, has been understood only after synaptic reorganization after waking from sleep. Our findings provide a mechanism for how systems-level brain communication can occur during an otherwise low connectivity sleep state, indicating that SOs are a gating mechanism for large-scale neural communication, which is the necessary substrate for systems consolidation and long-term memory formation.

                Human and non-human primates produce rhythmical sounds as soon as they are born. These early vocalizations are important for soliciting the attention of caregivers. How they develop, remains a mystery. The orofacial movements necessary for producing these vocalizations have distinct spatiotemporal signatures. Therefore, their development could potentially be tracked over the course of prenatal life. We densely and longitudinally sampled fetal head and orofacial movements in marmoset monkeys using ultrasound imaging. We show that orofacial movements necessary for producing rhythmical vocalizations differentiate from a larger movement pattern that includes the entire head. We also show that signature features of marmoset infant contact calls emerge prenatally as a distinct pattern of orofacial movements. Our results establish that aspects of the sensorimotor development necessary for vocalizing occur prenatally, even before the production of sound.
