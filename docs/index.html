              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional neural architecture of cognitive control mediates the relationship between individual differences in bilingual experience and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Bilinguals have often, but not always, been found to outperform monolinguals on domain-general attentional control. Inconsistent findings have been argued to stem, at least partly, from treating bilingualism as a uniform category and from not considering how neural adaptations to bilingual experiences modulate behavioural outcomes. The present study investigated how patterns of language experience, including language switching behaviour, duration and intensity/diversity of bilingual language use, influence the brain processes underlying cognitive control, and how these in turn translate to cognitive control performance. We examined reaction times and spectral dynamics of the electroencephalograms (EEG) of two-hundred-and-thirty-nine participants (about 70% bilinguals) with diverse language experiences during two cognitive control paradigms testing interference suppression (flanker and Simon task). Using structural equation modelling, we found that different bilingual experience factors were related with neurocognitive measures, which in turn were related with behavioural interference effects, for the flanker but not the Simon task. More specifically, increased frequency of language switching and intensity / diversity of bilingual language usage was negatively related to induced top-down control measures (especially midline-frontal theta), which in turn was beneficial for interference control. In contrast, duration of bilingual engagement correlated negatively with evoked bottom-up control measures (especially P3) and was therefore detrimental to interference control. We demonstrate here for the first time how the different factors of bilingual experience lead to different neural adaptations which impact behavioural outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ASD gene Bcl11a regulates subcellular RNA localization, associative circuitry, and social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Precise, area-specific connectivity of interhemispheric callosal projection neurons (CPN) in the cerebral cortex is critical for sensory, associative, and behavioral functions. CPN circuitry, which connects and integrates the cerebral hemispheres via the corpus callosum, is centrally implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Though transcriptional controls regulating CPN subtype and areal development are partially understood, downstream subcellular molecular machinery that implements CPN circuitry is essentially unknown. Here, we identify that the highly penetrant ASD/ID risk gene Bcl11a/Ctip1 is critical developmentally for appropriate and precise areal targeting of superficial layer CPN (CPNSL) projections, and that its deletion strikingly re-routes some CPNSL projections subcortically, causes dramatic disruption to subcellular CPNSL growth cone (GC) molecular machinery, and disrupts social behavior and cognition in mice. CPNSL-specific embryonic deletion of Bcl11a causes loss of correct homotopic targeting in the contralateral cortex, re-routes a substantial proportion of axonal projections through the anterior commissure, and induces strikingly aberrant, but specific and precise, projections to the basolateral amygdala. Importantly, bilateral deletion of Bcl11a from CPNSL results in abnormal social behavior and working memory. Mechanistically, we identify dysregulation of the CPNSL axonal GC-localized transcriptome in Bcl11a nulls, due to either aberrant transcription or trafficking of individual transcripts. These molecular mis-localizations disrupt axon guidance and CPNSL circuitry formation. Together, this work identifies critical functions for Bcl11a in CPNSL axonal connectivity, development of functional associative-social circuitry, and regulation of subtype-specific subcellular molecular machinery in vivo, revealing novel GC-localized transcripts that regulate precise axonal targeting and circuit formation. These results elucidate development and ASD/ID disease-related circuit disruption of CPNSL, and the importance of understanding circuit-specific subcellular molecular machinery by neurons.

     alt="Subclass-specific expression patterns of MET receptor tyrosine kinase during development in medial prefrontal and visual cortices"/>
<p>Percentage of MET-expressing neurons in medial prefrontal and primary visual (V1) cortices varies between layer and age in mice. The predominant subclass of MET<sup>+</sup> projection neurons in mPFC is subcortical, including corticothalamic, whereas it is intratelencephalic in V1, demonstrating stark heterogeneity between cortical regions. 

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Met</i> encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) that is expressed during development and regulates cortical synapse maturation. Conditional deletion of <i>Met</i> in the nervous system during embryonic development leads to deficits in adult contextual fear learning, a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dependent cognitive task. MET also regulates the timing of critical period plasticity for ocular dominance in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the underlying circuitry responsible remains unknown. Therefore, this study determines the broad expression patterns of MET throughout postnatal development in mPFC and V1 projection neurons (PNs), providing insight into similarities and differences in the neuronal subtypes and temporal patterns of MET expression between cortical areas. Using a transgenic mouse line that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in <i>Met<sup>+</sup>
</i> neurons, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed to visualize MET-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell bodies and PN subclass-specific protein markers. Analyses reveal that the MET expression is highly enriched in infragranular layers of mPFC, but in supragranular layers of V1. Interestingly, temporal regulation of the percentage of MET<sup>+</sup> neurons across development not only differs between cortical regions but also is distinct between lamina within a cortical region. Further, MET is expressed predominantly in the subcerebral PN subclass in mPFC, but the intratelencephalic PN subclass in V1. The data suggest that MET signaling influences the development of distinct circuits in mPFC and V1 that underlie subcerebral and intracortical functional deficits following <i>Met</i> deletion, respectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Mitochondrial Enzyme 17{beta}HSD10 Modulates Ischemic and Amyloid-{beta}-Induced Stress in Primary Mouse Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Severe brain metabolic dysfunction and amyloid-&beta; accumulation are key hallmarks of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). While astrocytes contribute to both pathologic mechanisms, the role of their mitochondria, which is essential for signaling and maintenance of these processes, has been largely understudied. The current work provides the first direct evidence that the mitochondrial metabolic switch 17&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17&beta;HSD10) is expressed and active in murine astrocytes from different brain regions. While it is known that this protein is overexpressed in the brains of AD patients, we found that 17&beta;HSD10 is also upregulated in astrocytes exposed to amyloidogenic and ischemic stress. Importantly, such catalytic overexpression of 17&beta;HSD10 inhibits mitochondrial respiration during increased energy demand. This observation contrasts with what has been found in neuronal and cancer model systems, which suggests astrocyte-specific mechanisms mediated by the protein. Furthermore, the catalytic upregulation of the enzyme exacerbates astrocytic damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial network alterations during amyloidogenic stress. On the other hand, 17&beta;HSD10 inhibition through AG18051 counters most of these effects. In conclusion, our data represents novel insights into the role of astrocytic mitochondria in metabolic and amyloidogenic stress with implications of 17&beta;HSD10 in multiple neurodegenerative mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal-Prefrontal {theta} Coupling Develops as Mice Become Proficient in Associative Odorant Discrimination Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Learning and memory requires coordinated activity between different regions of the brain. Here, we studied the interaction between infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal dorsal CA1 during associative odorant discrimination learning in the mouse. We found that as the animal learns to discriminate odorants in a go-no go task, the coupling of high-frequency neural oscillations to the phase of  oscillations (-referenced phase-amplitude coupling or tPAC) changes in a manner that results in divergence between rewarded and unrewarded odorant-elicited changes in the  phase-referenced power (tPRP) for &beta; and  oscillations. In addition, in the proficient animal there was a decrease in the coordinated oscillatory activity between CA1 and mPFC in the presence of the unrewarded odorant. Furthermore, the changes in tPAC resulted in a marked increase in the accuracy for decoding contextual odorant identity from tPRP when the animal became proficient. Finally, we studied the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&alpha; (CaMKII&alpha;), a protein involved in learning and memory, in oscillatory neural processing in this task. We find that the accuracy for decoding the contextual odorant identity from tPRP decreases in CaMKII&alpha; knock-out mice and that this accuracy correlates with behavioral performance. These results implicate a role for tPAC and CaMKII&alpha; in olfactory go-no go associative learning in the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Natural Contrast Statistics Facilitate Human Face Categorization</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to detect faces in the environment is of utmost ecological importance for human social adaptation. While face categorization is efficient, fast and robust to sensory degradation, it is massively impaired when the facial stimulus does not match the natural contrast statistics of this visual category, i.e., the typically experienced ordered alternation of relatively darker and lighter regions of the face. To clarify this phenomenon, we characterized the contribution of natural contrast statistics to face categorization. Specifically, 31 human adults viewed various natural images of nonface categories at a rate of 12 Hz, with highly variable images of faces occurring every eight stimuli (1.5 Hz). As in previous studies, neural responses at 1.5 Hz as measured with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) provided an objective neural index of face categorization. Here, when face images were shown in their naturally experienced contrast statistics, the 1.5-Hz face categorization response emerged over occipito-temporal electrodes at very low contrast [5.1%, or 0.009 root-mean-square (RMS) contrast], quickly reaching optimal amplitude at 22.6% of contrast (i.e., RMS contrast of 0.041). Despite contrast negation preserving an image&rsquo;s spectral and geometrical properties, negative contrast images required twice as much contrast to trigger a face categorization response, and three times as much to reach optimum. These observations characterize how the internally stored natural contrast statistics of the face category facilitate visual processing for the sake of fast and efficient face categorization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors for the incomplete immunization of children of health workers at a tertiary referral hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Health workers as role models play a key role in increasing immunization coverage. The coverage of complete basic immunization in the city of Surabaya is 98.1%, a figure not similar to the incidences of infectious diseases that can be prevented by immunization. This study aims to determine the risk factors for incomplete immunization of the children of health workers. Methods: A case-control questionnaire study comparing incompletely immunized children (case group) and completely immunized children (control group) was done. Participants were children of health workers at a tertiary referral hospital in Surabaya. We conducted interviews and distributed and collected questionnaires from December 2021 to April 2022. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using the Pearson chi-square test and binary logistic regression. Results: Overall, 148 questionnaires were distributed, 33 of which were excluded due to incomplete data. Therefore, 115 health workers’ children were eligible participants. 62 participants (53.9%) made up the case group, while the control group consisted of 53 participants (46.1%). The average age of the children was 12.5 months, 51.3% were boys and 48.7% were girls. The parental age, parental knowledge, mother's education, and the presence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a significant association with the children’s immunization status with p-values of 0.043, 0.005, 0.002, and p < 0.001, respectively. The children of health workers with a low level of knowledge are 4.8 times more likely to be incompletely immunized (OR 4.887, 95% CI 1.346–35.152). In addition, the possibility of the incomplete immunization of a child is eight times higher for a low-income family (OR 8.679; 95% CI 1.429–52.701). Conclusions: Low levels of parental knowledge and income are associated with the occurrence of incomplete immunization among the children of health workers at a tertiary referral hospital in Surabaya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of virtual modality for stroke caregivers in facilitating stroke survivors and assessing their perceptions in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke survivors become either partially or completely dependent on their family members for assistance. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new set of challenges for caregiving, due to government-imposed lockdowns. In the current crisis, the crucial role of virtual modality in stroke caregiving can no longer be ignored. Therefore, this review aims to report the utilization of virtual modality to facilitate stroke caregivers in delivering care to stroke survivors in this pandemic. Moreover, it will also assess the perceptions of stroke caregivers in managing stroke survivors during pandemic Methods: An electronic search was carried out between 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2022 to explore the role of virtual platforms to assess stroke caregivers’ perceptions and the use of a distant medium in managing stroke survivors’ care in the COVID-19 era by using four electronic data bases that includes PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Science Direct, and Cochrane. Results The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly complicated the stroke caregiver’s life and their ability to deliver care. Therefore, utilizing virtual medium serves as a unique supplemental resource in warranting patient care continuity. The current review provides evidence for the integration of distant modality in facilitating stroke caregivers to manage stroke survivors and it also assesses their perception during pandemic. Conclusion: The current review provides limited but encouraging data that promotes the efficacy of virtual models in healthcare. It was identified that distant healthcare services are suitable and accessible for the provision of care to the community of stroke caregivers during this pandemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying the genes impacted by cell proliferation in proteomics and transcriptomics studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie Locard-Paulet, Oana Palasca, Lars Juhl Jensen</p>

Hypothesis-free high-throughput profiling allows relative quantification of thousands of proteins or transcripts across samples and thereby identification of differentially expressed genes. It is used in many biological contexts to characterize differences between cell lines and tissues, identify drug mode of action or drivers of drug resistance, among others. Changes in gene expression can also be due to confounding factors that were not accounted for in the experimental plan, such as change in cell proliferation. We combined the analysis of 1,076 and 1,040 cell lines in five proteomics and three transcriptomics data sets to identify 157 genes that correlate with cell proliferation rates. These include actors in DNA replication and mitosis, and genes periodically expressed during the cell cycle. This signature of cell proliferation is a valuable resource when analyzing high-throughput data showing changes in proliferation across conditions. We show how to use this resource to help in interpretation of <i>in vitro</i> drug screens and tumor samples. It informs on differences of cell proliferation rates between conditions where such information is not directly available. The signature genes also highlight which hits in a screen may be due to proliferation changes; this can either contribute to biological interpretation or help focus on experiment-specific regulation events otherwise buried in the statistical analysis.

                <p>by Gerardo Chowell, Sushma Dahal, Amna Tariq, Kimberlyn Roosa, James M. Hyman, Ruiyan Luo</p>

We analyze an ensemble of <i>n</i>-sub-epidemic modeling for forecasting the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics. These ensemble modeling approaches, and models that integrate sub-epidemics to capture complex temporal dynamics, have demonstrated powerful forecasting capability. This modeling framework can characterize complex epidemic patterns, including plateaus, epidemic resurgences, and epidemic waves characterized by multiple peaks of different sizes. We systematically assess their calibration and short-term forecasting performance in short-term forecasts for the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA from late April 2020 to late February 2022. We compare their performance with two commonly used statistical ARIMA models. The best fit sub-epidemic model and three ensemble models constructed using the top-ranking sub-epidemic models consistently outperformed the ARIMA models in terms of the weighted interval score (WIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval across the 10-, 20-, and 30-day short-term forecasts. In our 30-day forecasts, the average WIS ranged from 377.6 to 421.3 for the sub-epidemic models, whereas it ranged from 439.29 to 767.05 for the ARIMA models. Across 98 short-term forecasts, the ensemble model incorporating the top four ranking sub-epidemic models (Ensemble(4)) outperformed the (log) ARIMA model 66.3% of the time, and the ARIMA model, 69.4% of the time in 30-day ahead forecasts in terms of the WIS. Ensemble(4) consistently yielded the best performance in terms of the metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions. This framework can be readily applied to investigate the spread of epidemics and pandemics beyond COVID-19, as well as other dynamic growth processes found in nature and society that would benefit from short-term predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring impact of vaccination among wildlife: The case of bait vaccine campaigns for classical swine fever epidemic among wild boar in Japan</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryota Matsuyama, Takehisa Yamamoto, Yoko Hayama, Ryosuke Omori</p>

Understanding the impact of vaccination in a host population is essential to control infectious diseases. However, the impact of bait vaccination against wildlife diseases is difficult to evaluate. The vaccination history of host animals is generally not observable in wildlife, and it is difficult to distinguish immunity by vaccination from that caused by disease infection. For these reasons, the impact of bait vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar inhabiting Japan has not been evaluated accurately. In this study, we aimed to estimate the impact of the bait vaccination campaign by modelling the dynamics of CSF and the vaccination process among a Japanese wild boar population. The model was designed to estimate the impact of bait vaccination despite lack of data regarding the demography and movement of wild boar. Using our model, we solved the theoretical relationship between the impact of vaccination, the time-series change in the proportion of infected wild boar, and that of immunised wild boar. Using this derived relationship, the increase in antibody prevalence against CSF because of vaccine campaigns in 2019 was estimated to be 12.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 7.8–16.5). Referring to previous reports on the basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) of CSF in wild boar living outside Japan, the amount of vaccine distribution required for CSF elimination by reducing the effective reproduction number under unity was also estimated. An approximate 1.6 (when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.5, target vaccination coverage is 33.3% of total population) to 2.9 (when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.5, target vaccination coverage is 60.0% of total population) times larger amount of vaccine distribution would be required than the total amount of vaccine distribution in four vaccination campaigns in 2019.

                <p>by Javier A. Romero, Paulina Putko, Mateusz Urbańczyk, Krzysztof Kazimierczuk, Anna Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk</p>

NMR spectroscopy is key in the study of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Yet, even the first step in such an analysis—the assignment of observed resonances to particular nuclei—is often problematic due to low peak dispersion in the spectra of IDPs. We show that the assignment process can be aided by finding “hidden” chemical shift patterns specific to the amino acid residue types. We find such patterns in the training data from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank using linear discriminant analysis, and then use them to classify spin systems in an <i>α</i>-synuclein sample prepared by us. We describe two situations in which the procedure can greatly facilitate the analysis of NMR spectra. The first involves the mapping of spin systems chains onto the protein sequence, which is part of the assignment procedure—a prerequisite for any NMR-based protein analysis. In the second, the method supports assignment transfer between similar samples. We conducted experiments to demonstrate these cases, and both times the majority of spin systems could be unambiguously assigned to the correct residue types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A caspase–RhoGEF axis contributes to the cell size threshold for apoptotic death in developing Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aditya Sethi, Hai Wei, Nikhil Mishra, Ioannis Segos, Eric J. Lambie, Esther Zanin, Barbara Conradt</p>

A cell’s size affects the likelihood that it will die. But how is cell size controlled in this context and how does cell size impact commitment to the cell death fate? We present evidence that the caspase CED-3 interacts with the RhoGEF ECT-2 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuroblasts that generate “unwanted” cells. We propose that this interaction promotes polar actomyosin contractility, which leads to unequal neuroblast division and the generation of a daughter cell that is below the critical “lethal” size threshold. Furthermore, we find that hyperactivation of ECT-2 RhoGEF reduces the sizes of unwanted cells. Importantly, this suppresses the “cell death abnormal” phenotype caused by the partial loss of <i>ced-3</i> caspase and therefore increases the likelihood that unwanted cells die. A putative null mutation of <i>ced-3</i> caspase, however, is not suppressed, which indicates that cell size affects CED-3 caspase activation and/or activity. Therefore, we have uncovered novel sequential and reciprocal interactions between the apoptosis pathway and cell size that impact a cell’s commitment to the cell death fate.

                The habenula receives direct input from the prefrontal cortex, driving drug-seeking behaviors in preclinical models of addiction. Using diffusion MRI, King et al. identified microstructural abnormalities in the structural connections of the prefrontal cortex and habenula in humans with cocaine or heroin addiction, extending the translational importance of this circuit.

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 06 October 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01633-w">doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01633-w</a></p>Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) reads continuous native RNA strands. Early adopters have used this technology to document nucleotide modifications and 3′ polyadenosine tails on RNA strands without added chemistry steps. Individual strands ranging in length from 70 to 26,000 nucleotides have been sequenced. In our opinion, broader acceptance of nanopore DRS by molecular biologists and cell biologists will be accelerated by higher basecall accuracy and lower RNA input requirements.

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 06 October 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01629-6">doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01629-6</a></p>In recent years, the number of annotated noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) has increased dramatically. The wide range of RBPs identified highlights the enormous potential for RNA in virtually all aspects of cell biology, from transcriptional regulation to metabolic control. Yet, there is a growing gap between what is possible and what has been demonstrated to be functionally important. Here we highlight recent methodological developments in the study of RNA–protein interactions, discuss the challenges and opportunities for exploring their functional roles, and provide our perspectives on what is needed to bridge the gap in this rapidly expanding field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Label-free imaging of M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes in the human dermis in vivo using two-photon excited FLIM</a></h4>

              
                Macrophages (ΜΦs) are important immune effector cells that promote (M1 ΜΦs) or inhibit (M2 ΜΦs) inflammation and are involved in numerous physiological and pathogenic immune responses. Their precise role and relevance, however, is not fully understood for lack of non-invasive quantification methods. Here, we show that two-photon excited fluorescence lifetime imaging (TPE-FLIM), a label-free non-invasive method, can visualize ΜΦs in the human dermis <i>in vivo</i>. We demonstrate <i>in vitro</i> that human dermal ΜΦs exhibit specific TPE-FLIM properties that distinguish them from the main components of the extracellular matrix and other dermal cells. We visualized ΜΦs, their phenotypes and phagocytosis in the skin of healthy individuals <i>in vivo</i> using TPE-FLIM. Additionally, machine learning identified M1 and M2 MФs with a sensitivity of 0.88±0.04 and 0.82±0.03 and a specificity of 0.89±0.03 and 0.90±0.03, respectively. In clinical research, TPE-FLIM can advance the understanding of the role of MФs in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fat body phospholipid state dictates hunger driven feeding behavior</a></h4>

              
                Diet-induced obesity leads to dysfunctional feeding behavior. However, the precise molecular nodes underlying diet-induced feeding motivation dysregulation are poorly understood. The fruit fly is a simple genetic model system yet displays significant evolutionary conservation to mammalian nutrient sensing and energy balance. Using a longitudinal high sugar regime in <i>Drosophila</i>, we sought to address how diet-induced changes in adipocyte lipid composition regulate feeding behavior. We observed that subjecting adult <i>Drosophila</i> to a prolonged high-sugar diet degrades the hunger-driven feeding response. Lipidomics analysis reveals that longitudinal exposure to high-sugar diets significantly alters whole-body phospholipid profiles. By performing a systematic genetic screen for phospholipid enzymes in adult fly adipocytes, we identify Pect as a critical regulator of hunger-driven feeding. Pect is a rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis pathway and the fly ortholog of human PCYT2. We show that disrupting Pect activity only in the <i>Drosophila</i> fat cells causes insulin resistance, dysregulated lipoprotein delivery to the brain, and a loss of hunger-driven feeding. Previously human studies have noted a correlation between PCYT2/Pect levels and clinical obesity. Now, our unbiased studies in <i>Drosophila</i> provide causative evidence for adipocyte Pect function in metabolic homeostasis. Altogether, we have uncovered that PE phospholipid homeostasis regulates hunger response.

                Despite the importance of innate immunity in invertebrates, the diversity and function of innate immune cells in invertebrates are largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identified prohemocytes, monocytic hemocytes, and granulocytes as the three major cell-types in the white shrimp hemolymph. Our results identified a novel macrophage-like subset called monocytic hemocytes 2 (MH2) defined by the expression of certain marker genes, including <i>Nlrp3</i> and <i>Casp1</i>. This subtype of shrimp hemocytes is phagocytic and expresses markers that indicate some conservation with mammalian macrophages. Combined, our work resolves the heterogenicity of hemocytes in a very economically important aquatic species and identifies a novel innate immune cell subset that is likely a critical player in the immune responses of shrimp to threatening infectious diseases affecting this industry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ferric reductase-related proteins mediate fungal heme acquisition</a></h4>

              
                Heme can serve as iron source in many environments, including the iron-poor animal host environment. The fungal pathobiont <i>Candida albicans</i> expresses a family of extracellular CFEM hemophores that capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane, to be endocytosed and utilized as heme or iron source. Here we identified Frp1 and Frp2, two ferric reductase (FRE)-related proteins that lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain, as being required for hemoglobin heme utilization and for sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. Frp1 and Frp2 redistribute to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemin, consistent with a direct role in heme trafficking. Expression of Frp1 with the CFEM hemophore Pga7 can promote heme utilization in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as well, confirming the functional interaction between these proteins. Sequence and structure comparison reveals that the CFEM hemophores are related to the FRE substrate-binding domain that is missing in Frp1/2. We conclude that Frp1/2 and the CFEM hemophores form a functional complex that evolved from ferric reductases to enable extracellular heme uptake.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic allostery in substrate binding by human thymidylate synthase</a></h4>

              
                Human thymidylate synthase (hTS) is essential for DNA replication and therefore a therapeutic target for cancer. Effective targeting requires knowledge of the mechanism(s) of regulation of this 72 kDa homodimeric enzyme. Here, we investigate the mechanism of binding cooperativity of the nucleotide substrate. We have employed exquisitely sensitive methyl-based CPMG and CEST NMR experiments enabling us to identify residues undergoing bifurcated linear 3-state exchange, including concerted switching between active and inactive conformations in the apo enzyme. The inactive state is populated to only ~1.3%, indicating that conformational selection contributes negligibly to the cooperativity. Instead, methyl rotation axis order parameters, determined by <sup>2</sup>H transverse relaxation rates, suggest that rigidification of the enzyme upon substrate binding is responsible for the entropically-driven cooperativity. Lack of the rigidification in product binding and substrate binding to an N-terminally truncated enzyme, both non-cooperative, support this idea. In addition, the lack of this rigidification in the N-terminal truncation indicates that interactions between the flexible N-terminus and the rest of the protein, which are perturbed by substrate binding, play a significant role in the cooperativity—a novel mechanism of dynamic allostery. Together, these findings yield a rare depth of insight into the substrate binding cooperativity of an essential enzyme.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Independent regulation of mitochondrial DNA quantity and quality in Caenorhabditis elegans primordial germ cells</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria harbor an independent genome, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which contains essential metabolic genes. Although mtDNA mutations occur at high frequency, they are inherited infrequently, indicating that germline mechanisms limit their accumulation. To determine how germline mtDNA is regulated, we examined the control of mtDNA quantity and quality in <i>C. elegans</i> primordial germ cells (PGCs). We show that PGCs combine strategies to generate a low point in mtDNA number by segregating mitochondria into lobe-like protrusions that are cannibalized by adjacent cells, and by concurrently eliminating mitochondria through autophagy, reducing overall mtDNA content twofold. As PGCs exit quiescence and divide, mtDNAs replicate to maintain a set point of ~200 mtDNAs per germline stem cell. Whereas cannibalism and autophagy eliminate mtDNAs stochastically, we show that the kinase PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), operating independently of Parkin and autophagy, preferentially reduces the fraction of mutant mtDNAs. Thus, PGCs employ parallel mechanisms to control both the quantity and quality of the founding population of germline mtDNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila mechanical nociceptors preferentially sense localized poking</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical nociception is an evolutionarily conserved sensory process required for the survival of living organisms. Previous studies have revealed much about the neural circuits and sensory molecules in mechanical nociception, but the cellular mechanisms adopted by nociceptors in force detection remain elusive. To address this issue, we study the mechanosensation of a fly larval nociceptor (class IV da neurons, c4da) using a customized mechanical device. We find that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale forces and make uniform responses to the forces applied at different dendritic regions. Moreover, c4da showed a greater sensitivity to localized forces, consistent with them being able to detect the poking of sharp objects, such as wasp ovipositor. Further analysis reveals that high morphological complexity, mechanosensitivity to lateral tension and possibly also active signal propagation in dendrites contribute to the sensory features of c4da. In particular, we discover that Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26, two key mechanosensory molecules, make differential but additive contributions to the mechanosensitivity of c4da. In all, our results provide updates into understanding how c4da process mechanical signals at the cellular level and reveal the contributions of key molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 5:2 diet does not increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis or enhance spatial memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                New neurones are generated throughout life in the mammalian brain in a process known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Since this phenomenon grants a high degree of neuroplasticity influencing learning and memory and mood related behaviour, identifying factors that regulate AHN may be important for ameliorating age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Calorie restriction (CR), in the absence of malnutrition, has been shown to enhance AHN and improve hippocampal-dependent memory, mediated by the stomach hormone, ghrelin. Intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary strategy offering more flexibility than conventional CR, also promotes aspects of AHN. The 5:2 diet is a popular form of IF linked to a range of health benefits, however its effects on AHN and spatial memory are not well characterised. We hypothesised that the 5:2 diet would enhance AHN in a ghrelin-dependent manner. To assess this, we used immunohistochemistry to quantify new adult-born neurones and new neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampal DG of adolescent and adult wild-type and mice lacking the ghrelin receptor following six weeks on a 5:2 diet. We report an age-related decline in neurogenic processes and identify a novel role for ghrelin-receptor in regulating the formation of new adult born NSCs in an age-dependent manner. However, the 5:2 diet did not affect new neurone or NSC formation in the DG. Consistent with this finding the 5:2 diet did not alter performance on a spatial learning and memory task. These data suggest that the 5:2 diet used in this study does not increase AHN or improve associated spatial memory function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A graph-matching based metric of functional connectome distance between pairs of individuals varies with their ages, cognitive performances and familial relationships.</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectomes (FCs), represented by networks or graphs that summarize coactivation patterns between pairs of brain regions, have been related at a population level to age, sex, cognitive/behavioral scores, life experience, genetics and disease/disorders. However, quantifying FC differences between pairs of individuals also provides a rich source of information with which to map to differences in those individuals' biology, experience, genetics or behavior. In this study, graph matching is used to create a novel inter-individual FC metric, called swap distance, that quantifies the distance between pairs of individuals' FCs. We apply graph matching to align FCs between pairs of individuals from the the Human Connectome Project (N = 997) and find that swap distance i) increases with increasing familial distance, ii) increases with subjects' ages, iii) is smaller for pairs of females compared to pairs of males, and iv) is larger for females with lower cognitive scores compared to females with larger cognitive scores. Regions that contributed most to individuals' swap distances were in higher-order networks, i.e. default-mode and fronto-parietal, that underlie executive function and memory. These higher-order networks' regions also had swap frequencies that varied monotonically with familial relatedness of the individuals in question. We posit that the proposed graph matching technique provides a novel way to study inter-subject differences in FC and enables quantification of how FC may vary with age, relatedness, sex and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Three transcriptional axes underpin anatomy, development, and disorders of the human cortex</a></h4>

              
                The Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has catalysed many discoveries linking macroscale brain organisation to microscale neurobiology, including the existence of a transcriptional axis stretching from sensorimotor to association cortices. However, the complex spatial structure of the human cortex likely includes multiple gradients of gene expression that have yet to be characterised. Here, we reveal two additional transcriptional axes that are anatomically differentiated and have distinct profiles of metabolic and immune function, cytoarchitecture, and developmental trajectory. Moreover, we validate the three transcriptional axes in external data, show they explain more than half of spatial variation across key anatomical and functional neuroimaging maps, and demonstrate they are dissociably aligned with maps of autism, depression, and schizophrenia from one of the largest case-control imaging datasets. Together, these results reveal how human brain anatomy, development, and disorders are patterned along multiple cortical axes underpinned by the intrinsic structure of gene transcription.

                The ability to change your mind when the local environment changes relies critically on cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits. In silico experiments on the CBGT pathways show how shifts in decision policy are driven by learning-induced changes in competition between action plans, both within and across action representations. We empirically validate this idea, using whole-brain hemodynamic imaging in homo sapiens to show how competition between action representations in CBGT circuits adaptively shifts the rate of evidence accumulation in response to action-outcome contingency changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced mTORC1 signaling and Protein Synthesis in Parkinson Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Pathological alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of alpha-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson disease (PD). Disruption of protein homeostasis is thought be central to PD pathogenesis, however the molecular mechanism of this deregulation is poorly understood. Here we report that pathologic alpha-syn binds to tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) 2 and destabilizes the TSC1-TSC2 complex leading to activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and enhanced mRNA translation. Dopamine neuron loss, behavioral deficits and aberrant biochemical signaling in the alpha-syn preformed fibril (PFF) and Drosophila alpha-syn transgenic models of pathologic alpha-syn induced degeneration were attenuated by genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR and protein translation. Our findings establish a potential molecular mechanism by which pathologic alpha-syn activates mTORC1 leading to enhanced protein translation and concomitant neurodegeneration in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural model of proximity to reward</a></h4>

              
                Throughout learning, refinement of cortical activity in cortex, a process termed credit assignment, underlies the refinement of behavioral actions leading to reward. While previous research shows the role of the striatum in linking behavior to reward, the role of the striatum in linking the underlying behaviorally-relevant cortical activity to reward remains unclear. Leveraging a neuroprosthetic task while recording from the rat cortex and striatum, we demonstrate that the striatum encodes the dynamics of the proximity of cortical activity to reward. Such encoding was independent from external task feedback and emerged as cortical activity consolidated over learning, with dorsal and ventral striatum playing complementary yet distinct roles. Striatal activity thus constitutes a neural model of cortical progress towards reward, suggesting one mechanism by which the brain implements credit assignment to refine behavior.

                Failed regeneration of myelin around neuronal axons following central nervous system damage contributes to nerve dysfunction and clinical decline in various neurological conditions, for which there is an unmet therapeutic demand. Here, we show that interaction between glial cells, astrocytes and mature myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, is a critical determinant of remyelination. Astrocytes support the survival of regenerating oligodendrocytes, via downregulation of the Nrf2 pathway associated with increased astrocytic cholesterol biosynthesis pathway activation. Remyelination fails following sustained astrocytic Nrf2 activation yet is restored by either cholesterol biosynthesis/efflux stimulation, or Nrf2 inhibition using the existing therapeutic Luteolin. We identify that astrocyte-oligodendrocyte interaction regulates remyelination, and reveal a drug strategy for central nervous system regeneration centred on targeting this interaction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">α-synuclein fibril and synaptic vesicle interactions lead to vesicle destruction and increased uptake into neurons</a></h4>

              
                Monomeric alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a well characterised as a lipid binding protein. aSyn is known to form amyloid fibrils which are also localised with lipids and organelles in so called Lewy bodies, insoluble structures found in Parkinson s disease patient s brains. It is still unclear under which conditions the aSyn-lipid interaction can start to become pathological. Previous work to address pathological interactions has focused on using synthetic lipid membranes, which lack the complexity of physiological lipid membranes which not only have a more complex lipid composition, but also contain lipid interacting proteins. Here, we investigate how either monomeric or fibrillar aSyn interact with physiological synaptic vesicles (SV) isolated from rodent brain. Using small angle neutron scattering and high-resolution imaging we observe that aSyn fibrils disintegrate SV, whereas aSyn monomers cause clustering of SV. Furthermore, SV enhance the aggregation rate of aSyn, however increasing the SV:aSyn ratio causes a reduction in aggregation propensity. SV lipids appear as an integrated part of aSyn fibrils and while the fibril morphology differs to aSyn fibrils alone, the core fibril structure remains the same. We finally demonstrate that lipid-associated aSyn fibrils are more easily taken up into cortical i3Neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Our study sheds light on differences between interactions of aSyn with synthetic lipid vesicles and physiological SV. We show how aSyn fibrils may enhance pathology by disintegrating SV, which in turn may have fatal consequences for neurons. Furthermore, disease burden may additionally be impacted by an increased uptake of lipid-associated aSyn by neurons, leading to more SV damage and enhancing aSyn aggregation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MeCP2 regulates Gdf11, a dosage-sensitive gene critical for neurological function</a></h4>

              
                Loss- and gain-of-function of MeCP2 causes Rett syndrome (RTT) and MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS), respectively. MeCP2 binds methyl-cytosines to finely tune gene expression in the brain, though identifying genes robustly regulated by MeCP2 has been difficult. By integrating multiple transcriptomics datasets, we identified that MeCP2 finely regulates Growth differentiation factor 11 (Gdf11). Gdf11 is down-regulated in RTT mouse models and is inversely up-regulated in MDS mouse models. Strikingly, genetically normalizing Gdf11 dosage levels improved several behavioral deficits in a mouse model of MDS. Next, we discovered that losing one copy of Gdf11 alone was sufficient to cause multiple neurobehavioral deficits in mice, most notably hyperactivity and decreased learning and memory. This decrease in learning and memory was not due to changes in proliferation or numbers of progenitor cells in the hippocampus. Lastly, loss of one copy of Gdf11 decreased longevity and survival in mice, corroborating its putative role in aging. Our data demonstrate that Gdf11 dosage is important for brain function.

	<p>Background: Parasellar chondrosarcomas are extremely rare. This study describes the characteristics of parasellar chondrosarcoma and analyzes the risk factors and prognosis based on the resection degree. Methods: Fifteen patients with pathologically diagnosed parasellar chondrosarcoma were retrospectively analyzed for the clinical data, surgical methods, and prognosis to identify relationships between the surgical resection degree, tumor recurrence, and imaging characteristics. Results: Twelve patients had eye dysfunction and ptosis. Differentiation from other parasellar tumors by imaging is difficult. The preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score positively correlated with the tumor resection degree (p = 0.026) and negatively correlated with the maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.001). Tumor recurrence negatively correlated with the resection degree (p = 0.009). The postoperative KPS score positively correlated with the preoperative KPS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and tumor resection degree (p = 0.026), and negatively correlated with the maximum tumor diameter (p = 0.016) and age (p = 0.047). An improved KPS score positively correlated with the tumor resection degree (p = 0.039). Patients who underwent total resection of the chondrosarcoma had longer progression-free survival than those who underwent partial resection (p = 0.0322). Conclusion: Parasellar chondrosarcomas are difficult to resect completely. Preoperative KPS score is an important factor for the degree of resection. KPS score, age, maximum tumor diameter, and resection degree may be important prognostic factors.</p>

	<p>Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has an important impact on the risk of morbidity and mortality, so we have designed the present study to understand which factor is most involved in the risk of developing a comorbidity between OSA severity and nocturnal hypoxemia. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 617 adult subjects who were referred to our unit for a suspicion of OSA between January 2018 and January 2020. Results: Sleep investigations performed by participants (72% male and obese in 70% of cases) reported an overall mean apnoea&amp;amp;ndash;hypopnoea index (AHI) of 44.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 24.8 events&amp;amp;middot;h&amp;amp;minus;1. Overall, 66% were classified as severe OSA and 76% experienced nocturnal hypoxemia. By analysing the burden of OSA severity and nocturnal hypoxemia on the comorbidities risk, multivariate analysis highlighted the predominant role of age and obesity. Accordingly, after the exclusion of the older and obese participants from the analyses, we noticed that severe OSA was related to the risk of hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 3.0 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4&amp;amp;ndash;6.2], p = 0.004) as well as nocturnal hypoxemia (OR = 2.6 [95% CI 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;5.4], p = 0.01). Conclusions: The study seems to suggest that in young, non-obese subjects, OSA is a predisposing factor for the risk of developing hypertension.</p>

	<p>Studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have demonstrated the importance of direction and intensity of the applied current when the primary motor cortex (M1) is targeted. By varying these, it is possible to stimulate different subsets of neural elements, as demonstrated by modulation of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and motor behaviour. The latter involves premotor areas as well, and among them, the presupplementary motor area (pre&amp;amp;minus;SMA) has recently received significant attention in the study of motor inhibition. It is possible that, similar to M1, different neuronal populations can be activated by varying the direction and intensity of TMS; however, the absence of a direct electrophysiological outcome has limited this investigation. The problem can be solved by quantifying direct cortical responses by means of combined TMS and electroencephalography (TMS&amp;amp;minus;EEG). We investigated the effect of variable coil orientations (0&amp;amp;deg;, 90&amp;amp;deg;, 180&amp;amp;deg; and 270&amp;amp;deg;) and stimulation intensities (100%, 120% and 140% of resting motor threshold) on local mean field potential (LMFP), transcranial evoked potential (TEP) peaks and TMS&amp;amp;minus;related spectral perturbation (TRSP) from pre&amp;amp;minus;SMA stimulation. As a result, early and late LMFP and peaks were larger, with the coil handle pointing posteriorly (0&amp;amp;deg;) and laterally (90&amp;amp;deg;). This was true also for TRSP in the &amp;amp;beta;&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;gamma; range, but, surprisingly, &amp;amp;theta;&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;alpha; TRSP was larger with the coil pointing at 180&amp;amp;deg;. A 90&amp;amp;deg; orientation activated the right M1, as shown by MEPs elicitation, thus limiting the spatial specificity of the stimulation. These results suggest that coil orientation and stimulation intensity are critical when stimulating the pre&amp;amp;minus;SMA.</p>

	<p>Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is the most common sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Its phenotypic variability, absence of formal evidence-based guidelines for treatment and underdiagnosis have made its management a challenge for clinicians. As a result, treatment of PTH has been mostly empiric. Although analgesics are the most popular drug of choice for PTH, they can present with several adverse effects and fail to address other psychosocial comorbidities associated with TBI. Non-pharmacological interventions thereby offer an intriguing alternative that can provide patients with PTH sustainable and effective care. This review article aims to: (1) provide an update on and describe different non-pharmacological interventions present in the recent literature; (2) provide clinical guidance to providers struggling with the management of patients with PTH; (3) emphasize the need for more high-quality trials examining the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments in patients with PTH. This review discusses 21 unique non-pharmacological treatments used for the management of PTH. Current knowledge of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of PTH is based on smaller scale studies, highlighting the need for larger randomized controlled trials to help establish formal evidence-based guidelines.</p>

	<p>One line of research on the possible ways of inhibiting the growth of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a brain tumor with a very poor prognosis, is the analysis of its metabolism, such as fatty acid synthesis by desaturases and elongases. This study examines the expression of elongases ELOVL1, ELOVL2, ELOVL3, ELOVL4, ELOVL5, ELOVL6, and ELOVL7 in GBM tumor samples from 28 patients (16 men and 12 women), using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To demonstrate the influence of the tumor microenvironment on the tested elongases, U-87 MG cells were cultured in nutrient-deficient conditions and with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) as a hypoxia-mimetic agent. The results showed that the expression of ELOVL1 and ELOVL7 in the GBM tumor was lower than in the peritumoral area. The expression of six of the seven studied elongases differed between the sexes. Hypoxia increased the expression of ELOVL5 and ELOVL6 and decreased the expression of ELOVL1, ELOVL3, ELOVL4, and ELOVL7 in U-87 MG cells. These results indicate that the synthesis of fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), in GBM tumors may be higher in men than in women. In contrast, the synthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) may be higher in women than in men.</p>

	<p>Purpose: 18F-Florzolotau is a novel second-generation tau radiotracer that shows higher binding affinity and selectivity and no off-target binding. The proportion loss of functional connectivity strength (PLFCS) is a new indicator for representing brain functional connectivity (FC) alteration. This study aims to estimate the relationship between the regional tau accumulation and brain FC abnormality in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients based on Florzolotau PET and fMRI. Methods: 22 NC (normal control), 31 MCI and 42 AD patients who have already been scanned with 18F-Florzolotau PET were recruited in this study. (We calculated the PLFCS and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of each node based on the Brainnetome atlas (BNA) template. The SUVR of 246 brain regions was calculated with the cerebellum as the reference region. Further functional connection strength (FCs), PLFCS and SUVR of each brain region were obtained in three groups for comparison.) For each patient, PLFCS and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were calculated based on the Brainnetome atlas (BNA) template. These results, as well as functional connection strength (FCs), were then compared between different groups. Multiple permutation tests were used to determine the target nodes between NC and cognitive impairment (CI) groups (MCI and AD). The relationship between PLFCS and neuropsychological scores or cortical tau deposit was investigated via Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Higher PLFCS and FCs in AD and MCI groups were found compared to the NC group. The PLFCS of 129 brain regions were found to be different between NC and CI groups, and 8 of them were correlated with tau SUVR, including superior parietal lobule (MCI: r = 0.4360, p = 0.0260, AD: r = -0.3663, p = 0.0280), middle frontal gyrus (AD: MFG_R_7_2: r = 0.4106, p = 0.0129; MFG_R_7_5: r = 0.4239, p = 0.0100), inferior frontal gyrus (AD: IFG_R_6_2: r = 0.3589, p = 0.0316), precentral gyrus (AD: PrG_R_6_6: r = 0.3493, p = 0.0368), insular gyrus (AD: INS_R_6_3: r = 0.3496, p = 0.0366) and lateral occipital cortex (AD: LOcC _L_4_3: r = -0.3433, p = 0.0404). Noteworthily, the opposing relationship was found in the superior parietal lobule in the MCI and AD groups. Conclusion: Brain functional connectivity abnormality is correlated with tau pathology in AD and MCI.</p>

	<p>Introduction. Pituitary adenomas have the potential to infiltrate the dura mater, skull, and the venous sinuses. Tumor extension into the cavernous sinus is often observed in pituitary adenomas and techniques and results of surgery in this region are vastly discussed in the literature. Infiltration of parasellar dura and its impact for pituitary surgery outcomes is significantly less studied but recent studies have suggested a role of endoscopic resection of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus, in selected cases. In this study, we discuss the techniques and outcomes of recently proposed techniques for selective resection of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus in endoscopic pituitary surgery. Methods. We performed a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and protocol and a total of 4 studies with 106 patients that underwent an endoscopic approach for resection of pituitary tumors with resection of medial wall from cavernous sinus were included. Clinical and radiological data were extracted (sex, mean age, Knosp, prior surgery, tumor size and type, complication rate, and remission) and a meta-analysis using the RevMan 5.4 software was performed. Results. A total of 5 studies with 208 patients were included in this analysis. The mean age of the study population was 48.87 years (range 25&amp;amp;ndash;82) with a female/male ratio of 1:1.36. Majority of the patients had Knosp Grade 1 (n = 77, 37.02%) and Grade 2 (n = 53, 25.48%). The complication rate was 4.81% (n = 33/106) and the most common complication observed was a new transient CN dysfunction and diplopia. Early disease remission was observed in 94.69% of the patients (n = 196/207). The prevalence rate of CS medial wall invasion varied from 10.4 % up to 36.7%. This invasion rate increased in frequency with higher Knosp Grade. The forest plot of persistent disease vs. remission in this surgery approach showed a p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001 and heterogeneity (I^2 = 0%). Discussion. Techniques to achieve resection of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus via the endoscopic endonasal approach include the &amp;amp;ldquo;anterior to posterior&amp;amp;rdquo; technique (opening of the anterior wall of the cavernous sinus) and the &amp;amp;ldquo;medial to lateral&amp;amp;rdquo; technique (opening of the inferior intercavernous sinus and). Although potentially related with improved endocrinological outcomes, these are advanced surgical techniques and require extensive anatomical knowledge and extensive surgical experience. Furthermore, to avoid procedure complications, extensive study of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s configuration of cavernous ICA, Doppler-guided intraoperative imaging, surgical navigation system, and blunt tip knives to dissect the ICA&amp;amp;rsquo;s plane are recommended. Conclusion. Endoscopic resection of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus has been associated with reports of high rates of postoperative hormonal control in functioning pituitary adenomas. However, it represents a more complex approach and requires advanced experience in endoscopic skull base surgery. Additional studies addressing case selection and studies evaluating long term results of this technique are still necessary.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Surround Inhibition Mediates Pain Relief by Low Amplitude Spinal Cord Stimulation: Modeling and Measurement</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Low-frequency (&lt;200 Hz), subperception spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a novel modality demonstrating therapeutic efficacy for treating chronic neuropathic pain. When stimulation parameters were carefully titrated, patients experienced rapid onset (seconds&ndash;minutes) pain relief without paresthesia, but the mechanisms of action are unknown. Using an integrated computational model and in vivo measurements in urethane-anesthetized rats, we quantified how stimulation parameters (placement, pulse width, frequency, and amplitude) influenced dorsal column (DC) axon activation and neural responses in the dorsal horn (DH). Both modeled and recorded DC axons responded with irregular spiking patterns in response to low-amplitude SCS. Maximum inhibition of DH neurons occurred at ~80% of the predicted sensory threshold in both modeled and recorded neurons, and responses were strongly dependent on spatially targeting of stimulation, i.e., the complement of DC axons activated, and on stimulation parameters. Intrathecal administration of bicuculline shifted neural responses to low-amplitude stimulation in both the model and experiment, suggesting that analgesia is dependent on segmental GABAergic mechanisms. Our results support the hypothesis that low-frequency subperception SCS generates rapid analgesia by activating a small number of DC axons which inhibit DH neuron activity via surround inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Working Memory Recruits Two Functionally Distinct Alpha Rhythms in Posterior Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oscillatory activity in the human brain is dominated by posterior alpha oscillations (8&ndash;14 Hz), which have been shown to be functionally relevant in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Although posterior alpha oscillations are commonly considered a single oscillator anchored at an individual alpha frequency (~10 Hz), previous work suggests that individual alpha frequency reflects a spatial mixture of different brain rhythms. In this study, we assess whether independent component analysis (ICA) can disentangle functionally distinct posterior alpha rhythms in the context of visual short-term memory retention. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 33 subjects while performing a visual working memory task. Group analysis at sensor level suggested the existence of a single posterior alpha oscillator that increases in power and decreases in frequency during memory retention. Conversely, single-subject analysis of independent components revealed the existence of two dissociable alpha rhythms: one that increases in power during memory retention (Alpha1) and another one that decreases in power (Alpha2). Alpha1 and Alpha2 rhythms were differentially modulated by the presence of visual distractors (Alpha1 increased in power while Alpha2 decreased) and had an opposite relationship with accuracy (positive for Alpha1 and negative for Alpha2). In addition, Alpha1 rhythms showed a lower peak frequency, a narrower peak width, a greater relative peak amplitude and a more central source than Alpha2 rhythms. Together, our results demonstrate that modulations in posterior alpha oscillations during short-term memory retention reflect the dynamics of at least two distinct brain rhythms with different functions and spatiospectral characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Simple and Efficient 3D-Printed Superfusion Chamber for Electrophysiological and Neuroimaging Recordings In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>In vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> experimentation in the central nervous system are effective approaches to study its functioning. Manipulations <I>in vitro</I> are characterized by easy experimental control and stable experimental conditions. However, transferring these advantages to <I>in vivo</I> research remains technically and ethically challenging, preventing many research teams from acquiring critical recordings in their animal models. In order to transfer the benefits of <I>in vitro</I> experimentation to <I>in vivo</I> experimentation, we developed a suite of 3D-printed tools (a superfusion chamber with an independent brain presser and animal stand). Using the immature rat barrel cortex as a model, we show that our set of tools (further "superfusion preparation") provides stable conditions for electrophysiological and neuroimaging recordings in the neonatal rat neocortex <I>in vivo</I>. Highly correlated intracellular and extracellular activity was recorded during spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, supporting the possibility of simultaneous long-lasting electrophysiological recordings from a single cortical column <I>in vivo</I>. The optical intrinsic signal of evoked cortical responses was also recorded from the skull-free neocortex, suggesting the effective combination of the superfusion preparation with neuroimaging approaches. Modulation of immature activity by epicortical application of pharmacological agents via superfusion equally supports the use of the superfused cortex preparation in pharmacological screening. In addition to high efficiency (in affordability, reliability, and ease of use <I>in vivo</I>), the 3D-printed set of tools developed should reduce animal use, supporting the 3Rs principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) of ethical use of animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HCN2 Ion Channels Drive Pain in Rodent Models of Migraine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is believed to be initiated by neuronal activity in the CNS, that triggers excitation of nociceptive trigeminal ganglion (TG) nerve fibers innervating the meninges and thus causes a unilateral throbbing headache. Drugs that precipitate or potentiate migraine are known to elevate intracellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides cAMP or cGMP, while anti-migraine treatments couple to signaling pathways that reduce cAMP or cGMP, suggesting an involvement of these cyclic nucleotides in migraine. Members of the HCN ion channel family are activated by direct binding of cAMP or cGMP, suggesting in turn that a member of this family may be a critical trigger of migraine. Here, we show that pharmacological block or targeted genetic deletion of HCN2 abolishes migraine-like pain in three rodent migraine models (in both sexes). Induction of migraine-like pain in these models triggered expression of the protein C-FOS, a marker of neuronal activity, in neurons of the trigeminocervical complex (TCC), where TG neurons terminate, and C-FOS expression was reversed by peripheral HCN2 inhibition. HCN2 block <I>in vivo</I> inhibited both evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity in nociceptive TG neurons. The NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) caused an increase in cGMP in the TG <I>in vivo</I>. Exposing isolated TG neurons to GTN caused a rightward shift in the voltage dependence of HCN currents and thus increased neuronal excitability. This work identifies HCN2 as a novel target for the development of migraine treatments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Migraine is believed to be initiated by localized excitability of neurons within the CNS, but the most disturbing symptom, the characteristic throbbing migraine headache pain, is widely agreed to be caused by activity in afferent pain-sensitive (nociceptive) nerve fibers of the trigeminal nerve. Using a variety of preclinical models of migraine, we identify the HCN2 ion channel as the molecular source of trigeminal hyperexcitability in migraine and we show that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of HCN2 can relieve migraine-like pain symptoms. The work highlights the HCN2 ion channel as a potential pharmacological target for the development of novel analgesics effective in migraine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Morphological Determinants of Cell-to-Cell Variations in Action Potential Dynamics in Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Action potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. As it greatly varies between neuronal types, AP shape is also used to distinguish neuronal populations. For instance, AP duration ranges from hundreds of microseconds in cerebellar granule cells to 2-3 ms in SNc dopaminergic (DA) neurons. While most of this variation across cell types seems to arise from differences in the voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels expressed, a few studies suggested that dendritic morphology also affects AP shape. AP duration also displays significant variability in a same neuronal type, although the determinants of these variations are poorly known. Using electrophysiological recordings, morphological reconstructions, and realistic Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley modeling, we investigated the relationships between dendritic morphology and AP shape in rat SNc DA neurons from both sexes. In this neuronal type where the axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), the duration of the somatic AP could be predicted from a linear combination of the ABD and non-ABDs' complexities. Dendrotomy experiments and simulation showed that these correlations arise from the causal influence of dendritic topology on AP duration, due in particular to a high density of sodium channels in the somatodendritic compartment. Surprisingly, computational modeling suggested that this effect arises from the influence of sodium currents on the decaying phase of the AP. Consistent with previous findings, these results demonstrate that dendritic morphology plays a major role in defining the electrophysiological properties of SNc DA neurons and their cell-to-cell variations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Action potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. AP shape (e.g., duration) greatly varies between neuronal types but also within a same neuronal type. While differences in ion channel expression seem to explain most of AP shape variation across cell types, the determinants of cell-to-cell variations in a same neuronal type are mostly unknown. We used electrophysiological recordings, neuronal reconstruction, and modeling to show that, because of the presence of sodium channels in the somatodendritic compartment, a large part of cell-to-cell variations in somatic AP duration in substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons is explained by variations in dendritic topology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Nedd4 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Pathway Inhibits Robo1 Repulsion and Promotes Commissural Axon Guidance across the Midline</a></h4>

              
                <p>Commissural axons initially respond to attractive signals at the midline, but once they cross, they become sensitive to repulsive cues. In insects and mammals, negative regulation of the surface expression of Roundabout (Robo) receptors prevents premature response to Slit. We previously identified two mammalian Nedd4 interacting proteins, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2, that act analogously to <I>Drosophila</I> Commissureless (Comm) to recruit mammalian Robo1 to late endosomes. However, whether Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases are required for Ndfip-mediated Robo1 regulation and midline axon crossing <I>in vivo</I> is not known. Here, we show using <I>in vitro</I> biochemical techniques and genetic analysis using embryonic mice of either sex that Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 are specifically required for Robo1 regulation and spinal commissural axon guidance. Biochemical data indicate that Robo1, Ndfip and Nedd4 form a ternary protein complex that depends on the presence of Ndfip, and these interactions are required for Robo1 endosomal sorting, ubiquitylation and degradation. Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 are expressed in commissural neurons in the developing spinal cord, and conditional deletion of Nedd4-1 or Nedd4-2 results in dose-dependent defects in midline crossing. We propose that Nedd4 E3 Ubiquitin ligases and their adaptor proteins Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 constitute a vital intracellular trafficking pathway required to downregulate Robo1 and promote midline crossing of commissural axons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During the development of the nervous system, many neurons extend their axons across the midline to establish circuits that are important for sensory, motor and cognitive functions. In order to cross the midline, axon responses to midline-derived cues must be precisely regulated. Here, we characterize an important intracellular trafficking pathway that regulates the membrane expression of the conserved Roundabout (Robo) axon guidance receptor- the receptor for the midline repellant Slit. We show that Nedd4 E3 Ubiquitin ligases and their Ndfip adapter proteins inhibit premature responses to Slit by promoting Robo degradation in precrossing commissural neurons in the developing spinal cord.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Dynamics of Neural Responses in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including subadditive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low contrast. These phenomena are often studied independently. Here, we demonstrate these phenomena within the same experiment and model the underlying neural computations with a single computational model. We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic recordings from patients presented with stimuli that varied in duration, interstimulus interval (ISI) and contrast. Aggregating data across patients from both sexes yielded 98 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1&ndash;V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several nonlinear features. Peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations, the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs, and response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model composed of a small set of canonical neuronal operations, that is, linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory inputs and neural responses change continuously over time. It is especially challenging to understand a system that has both dynamic inputs and outputs. Here, we use a computational modeling approach that specifies computations to convert a time-varying input stimulus to a neural response time course, and we use this to predict neural activity measured in the human visual cortex. We show that this computational model predicts a wide variety of complex neural response shapes, which we induced experimentally by manipulating the duration, repetition, and contrast of visual stimuli. By comparing data and model predictions, we uncover systematic properties of temporal dynamics of neural signals, allowing us to better understand how the brain processes dynamic sensory information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Unusually Slow Spike Frequency Adaptation in Deep Cerebellar Nuclei Neurons Preserves Linear Transformations on the Subsecond Timescale</a></h4>

              
                <p>Purkinje cells (PCs) are spontaneously active neurons of the cerebellar cortex that inhibit glutamatergic projection neurons within the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) that provide the primary cerebellar output. Brief reductions of PC firing rapidly increase DCN neuron firing. However, prolonged reductions of PC inhibition, as seen in some disease states, certain types of transgenic mice, during optogenetic suppression of PC firing, and in acute slices of the cerebellum, do not lead to large, sustained increases in DCN firing. Here we test whether DCN neurons undergo spike frequency adaptation that could account for these properties. We perform current-clamp recordings at near physiological temperature in acute brain slices from mice of both sexes to examine how DCN neurons respond to prolonged depolarizations. DCN neuron adaptation is exceptionally slow and bidirectional. A depolarizing current step evokes large initial increases in firing that decay to ~20% of the initial increase within ~10 s. We find that spike frequency adaptation in DCN neurons is mediated by a novel mechanism that is independent of the most promising candidates, including calcium entry and Na<sup>+</sup>-activated potassium channels mediated by <I>Slo2.1</I> and <I>Slo2.2</I>. Slow adaptation allows DCN neurons to gradually and bidirectionally adapt to prolonged currents but to respond linearly to current injection on rapid timescales. This suggests that an important consequence of slow adaptation is that DCN neurons respond linearly to the rate of PC firing on rapid timescales but adapt to slow firing rate changes of PCs on long timescales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excitatory neurons in the cerebellar nuclei provide the primary output from the cerebellum. This study finds that these neurons exhibit very slow bidirectional spike frequency adaptation that has important implications for cerebellar function. This mechanism allows neurons in the cerebellar nuclei to adapt to long-lasting changes in synaptic drive while also remaining responsive to short-term changes in excitatory or inhibitory drive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attractor-like Dynamics in the Subicular Complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Distinct computations are performed at multiple brain regions during the encoding of spatial environments. Neural representations in the hippocampal, entorhinal, and head direction (HD) networks during spatial navigation have been clearly documented, while the representational properties of the subicular complex (SC) are relatively underexplored, although it has extensive anatomic connections with various brain regions involved in spatial information processing. We simultaneously recorded single units from different subregions of the SC in male rats while they ran clockwise on a centrally placed textured circular track (four different textures, each covering a quadrant), surrounded by six distal cues. The neural activity was monitored in standard sessions by maintaining the same configuration between the cues, while in cue manipulation sessions, the distal and local cues were either rotated in opposite directions to create a mismatch between them or the distal cues were removed. We report a highly coherent neural representation of the environment and a robust coupling between the HD cells and the spatial cells in the SC, strikingly different from previous reports of coupling between cells from co-recorded sites. Neural representations were (1) originally governed by the distal cues under local&ndash;distal cue-conflict conditions, (2) controlled by the local cues in the absence of distal cues, and (3) governed by the cues that are perceived to be stable. We propose that such attractor-like dynamics in the SC might play a critical role in the orientation of spatial representations, thus providing a "reference map" of the environment for further processing by other networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subicular complex (SC) receives major inputs from the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, and head direction (HD) information directly from the HD system. Using cue-conflict experiments, we studied the hierarchical representation of the local and distal cues in the SC to understand its role in the cognitive map, and report a highly coherent neural representation with robust coupling between the HD cells and the spatial cells in different subregions of the SC exhibiting attractor-like dynamics unaffected by the cue manipulations, strikingly different from previous reports of coupling between cells from co-recorded sites. This unique feature may allow the SC to function as a single computational unit during the representation of space, which may serve as a reference map of the environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Encoding of Emotional Valence and Intensity in the Monkey Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have suggested that the primate amygdala plays an essential role in processing the emotional valence and intensity of visual stimuli, which is necessary for determining whether to approach or avoid a stimulus. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the evaluation of emotional value remain unknown. In the present study, we trained male macaque monkeys to perform an operant conditioning task in which fractal visual patterns were associated with three different amounts of air puff delivered to the cheek (negative) or liquid reward (positive). After confirming that the monkeys successfully differentiated the emotional valence and intensity of the visual stimuli, we analyzed neuronal responses to the stimuli in the amygdala. Most amygdala neurons conveyed information concerning the emotional valence and/or intensity of the visual stimuli, and the majority of those conveying information about emotional valence responded optimally to negative stimuli. Further, some amygdala neurons conveyed information related to both emotional valence and intensity, whereas a small portion conveyed information related to emotional intensity alone. These results indicate that the primate amygdala encodes both emotional valence and intensity, highlighting its important role in the avoidance of dangerous stimuli and animal survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Evaluating the emotional value of visual stimuli is essential for animal survival, especially in primates. Emotional value is estimated from the emotional valence and intensity of stimuli, and evidence indicates that the amygdala is likely to play a major role in processing these types of information. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to examine the responses of neurons in the monkey amygdala to visual stimuli that differ in emotional valence and intensity simultaneously. Our data suggest that the amygdala plays an important role in the evaluation of emotional stimuli and in the decision to escape negative and harmful stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Support for Contributions of Utility and Narrative Processing of Evidence in Juror Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Efforts to explain complex human decisions have focused on competing theories emphasizing utility and narrative mechanisms. These are difficult to distinguish using behavior alone. Both narrative and utility theories have been proposed to explain juror decisions, which are among the most consequential complex decisions made in a modern society. Here, we asked jury-eligible male and female subjects to rate the strength of a series of criminal cases while recording the resulting patterns of brain activation. We compared patterns of brain activation associated with evidence accumulation to patterns of brain activation derived from a large neuroimaging database to look for signatures of the cognitive processes associated with different models of juror decision-making. Evidence accumulation correlated with multiple narrative processes, including reading and recall. Of the cognitive processes traditionally viewed as components of utility, activation patterns associated with uncertainty, but not value, were more active with stronger evidence. Independent of utility and narrative, activations linked to reasoning and relational logic also correlated with increasing evidence. Hierarchical modeling of cognitive processes associated with evidence accumulation supported a more prominent role for narrative in weighing evidence in complex decisions. However, utility processes were also associated with evidence accumulation. These complementary findings support an emerging view that integrates utility and narrative processes in complex decisions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The last decade has seen a sharply increased interest in narrative as a central cognitive process in human decision-making and as an important factor in the evolution of human societies. However, the roles of narrative versus utility models of decision-making remain hotly debated. While available models frequently produce similar behavioral predictions, they rely on different cognitive processes and so their roles can be separated using the right neural tests. Here, we use brain imaging during mock juror decisions to show that cognitive processes associated with narrative, and to a lesser extent utility, were engaged while subjects evaluated evidence. These results are consistent with interactions between narrative and utility processes during complex decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Existence of the StartReact Effect Implies Reticulospinal, Not Corticospinal, Inputs Dominate Drive to Motoneurons during Voluntary Movement</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reaction time is accelerated if a loud (startling) sound accompanies the cue&mdash;the "StartReact" effect. Animal studies revealed a reticulospinal substrate for the startle reflex; StartReact may similarly involve the reticulospinal tract, but this is currently uncertain. Here we trained two female macaque monkeys to perform elbow flexion/extension movements following a visual cue. The cue was sometimes accompanied by a loud sound, generating a StartReact effect in electromyogram response latency, as seen in humans. Extracellular recordings were made from antidromically identified corticospinal neurons in primary motor cortex (M1), from the reticular formation (RF), and from the spinal cord (SC; C5&ndash;C8 segments). After loud sound, task-related activity was suppressed in M1 (latency, 70&ndash;200 ms after cue), but was initially enhanced (70&ndash;80 ms) and then suppressed (140&ndash;210 ms) in RF. SC activity was unchanged. In a computational model, we simulated a motoneuron pool receiving input from different proportions of the average M1 and RF activity recorded experimentally. Motoneuron firing generated simulated electromyogram, allowing reaction time measurements. Only if &ge;60% of motoneuron drive came from RF (&le;40% from M1) did loud sound shorten reaction time. The extent of shortening increased as more drive came from RF. If RF provided &lt;60% of drive, loud sound lengthened the reaction time&mdash;the opposite of experimental findings. The majority of the drive for voluntary movements is thus likely to originate from the brainstem, not the cortex; changes in the magnitude of the StartReact effect can measure a shift in the relative importance of descending systems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our results reveal that a loud sound has opposite effects on neural spiking in corticospinal cells from primary motor cortex, and in the reticular formation. We show that this fortuitously allows changes in reaction time produced by a loud sound to be used to assess the relative importance of reticulospinal versus corticospinal control of movement, validating previous noninvasive measurements in humans. Our findings suggest that the majority of the descending drive to motoneurons producing voluntary movement in primates comes from the reticulospinal tract, not the corticospinal tract.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Effort Reinforces Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans routinely learn the value of actions by updating their expectations based on past outcomes &ndash; a process driven by reward prediction errors (RPEs). Importantly, however, implementing a course of action also requires the investment of effort. Recent work has revealed a close link between the neural signals involved in effort exertion and those underpinning reward-based learning, but the behavioral relationship between these two functions remains unclear. Across two experiments, we tested healthy male and female human participants (<I>N</I> = 140) on a reinforcement learning task in which they registered their responses by applying physical force to a pair of hand-held dynamometers. We examined the effect of effort on learning by systematically manipulating the amount of force required to register a response during the task. Our key finding, replicated across both experiments, was that greater effort increased learning rates following positive outcomes and decreased them following negative outcomes, which corresponded to a differential effect of effort in boosting positive RPEs and blunting negative RPEs. Interestingly, this effect was most pronounced in individuals who were more averse to effort in the first place, raising the possibility that the investment of effort may have an adaptive effect on learning in those less motivated to exert it. By integrating principles of reinforcement learning with neuroeconomic approaches to value-based decision-making, we show that the very act of investing effort modulates one's capacity to learn, and demonstrate how these functions may operate within a common computational framework.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent work suggests that learning and effort may share common neurophysiological substrates. This raises the possibility that the very act of investing effort influences learning. Here, we tested whether effort modulates teaching signals in a reinforcement learning paradigm. Our results showed that effort resulted in more efficient learning from positive outcomes and less efficient learning from negative outcomes. Interestingly, this effect varied across individuals, and was more pronounced in those who were more averse to investing effort in the first place. These data highlight the importance of motivational factors in a common framework of reward-based learning, which integrates the computational principles of reinforcement learning with those of value-based decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Uncoupling Protein-1 Modulates Anxiety-Like Behavior in a Temperature-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>A strong bidirectional link between metabolic and psychiatric disorders exists; yet, the molecular basis underlying this interaction remains unresolved. Here we explored the role of the brown adipose tissue (BAT) as modulatory interface, focusing on the involvement of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), a key metabolic regulator highly expressed in BAT, in the control of emotional behavior. Male and female constitutive UCP-1 knock-out (KO) mice were used to investigate the consequences of UCP-1 deficiency on anxiety-related and depression-related behaviors under mild thermogenic (23&deg;C) and thermoneutral (29&deg;C) conditions. UCP-1 KO mice displayed a selective enhancement of anxiety-related behavior exclusively under thermogenic conditions, but not at thermoneutrality. Neural and endocrine stress mediators were not affected in UCP-1 KO mice, which showed an activation of the integrated stress response alongside enhanced fibroblast-growth factor-21 (FGF-21) levels. However, viral-mediated overexpression of FGF-21 did not phenocopy the behavioral alterations of UCP-1 KO mice and blocking FGF-21 activity did not rescue the anxiogenic phenotype of UCP-1 KO mice. No effects of surgical removal of the intrascapular BAT on anxiety-like behavior or FGF-21 levels were observed in either UCP-1 KO or WT mice. We provide evidence for a novel role of UCP-1 in the regulation of emotions that manifests as inhibitory constraint on anxiety-related behavior, exclusively under thermogenic conditions. We propose this function of UCP-1 to be independent of its activity in the BAT and likely mediated through a central role of UCP-1 in brain regions with converging involvement in energy and emotional control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this first description of a temperature-dependent phenotype of emotional behavior, we propose uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), the key component of the thermogenic function of the brown adipose tissue, as molecular break controlling anxiety-related behavior in mice. We suggest the involvement of UCP-1 in fear regulation to be mediated through its expression in brain regions with converging roles in energy and emotional control. These data are important and relevant in light of the largely unexplored bidirectional link between metabolic and psychiatric disorders, which has the potential for providing insight into novel therapeutic strategies for the management of both conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CSF1R-Mediated Myeloid Cell Depletion Prolongs Lifespan But Aggravates Distinct Motor Symptoms in a Model of Multiple System Atrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the CNS-resident macrophages and member of the myeloid lineage, microglia fulfill manifold functions important for brain development and homeostasis. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, they have been implicated in degenerative and regenerative processes. The discovery of distinct activation patterns, including increased phagocytosis, indicated a damaging role of myeloid cells in multiple system atrophy (MSA), a devastating, rapidly progressing atypical parkinsonian disorder. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profile of microglia in a mouse model of MSA (<I>MBP29-h</I>&alpha;<I>-syn</I>) and identified a disease-associated expression profile and upregulation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 (<I>Csf1</I>). Thus, we hypothesized that CSF1 receptor-mediated depletion of myeloid cells using PLX5622 modifies the disease progression and neuropathological phenotype in this mouse model. Intriguingly, sex-balanced analysis of myeloid cell depletion in <I>MBP29-h</I>&alpha;<I>-syn</I> mice revealed a two-faced outcome comprising an improved survival rate accompanied by a delayed onset of neurological symptoms in contrast to severely impaired motor functions. Furthermore, PLX5622 reversed gene expression profiles related to myeloid cell activation but reduced gene expression associated with transsynaptic signaling and signal release. While transcriptional changes were accompanied by a reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, striatal neuritic density was increased upon myeloid cell depletion in <I>MBP29-h</I>&alpha;<I>-syn</I> mice. Together, our findings provide insight into the complex, two-faced role of myeloid cells in the context of MSA emphasizing the importance to carefully balance the beneficial and adverse effects of CSF1R inhibition in different models of neurodegenerative disorders before its clinical translation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myeloid cells have been implicated as detrimental in the disease pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy. However, long-term CSF1R-dependent depletion of these cells in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy demonstrates a two-faced effect involving an improved survival associated with a delayed onset of disease and reduced inflammation which was contrasted by severely impaired motor functions, synaptic signaling, and neuronal circuitries. Thus, this study unraveled a complex role of myeloid cells in multiple system atrophy, which indicates important functions beyond the previously described disease-associated, destructive phenotype and emphasized the need of further investigation to carefully and individually fine-tune immunologic processes in different neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background: Probiotics are instrumental in maintaining the equilibrium of the gut microbiota and improving the health of the human body. This study examined the presence and physiological features, including the ability to produce exopolysaccharides, of lactic acid bacteria from fermented Tenggiri (Scomberomorus guttatus) and Talang (Chorinemus spp.) fish, also known as budu fish. Methods: Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from budu fish. These bacteria were characterized to determine tolerance to gastric pH values, growth curve, inhibitory ability against pathogenic bacteria, and ability to produce exopolysaccharides and to perform a molecular identification. Results: Twenty-nine lactic acid bacteria isolates from budu fish were determined to be of the Pediococcus species. Assessment of the physiological characteristics showed that Pediococcus sp. had a high acidifying activity and could grow at a pH between 2 and 11; the pH of the supernatant after 36 hours of incubation was 4.49. In terms of inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria, Pediococcus sp. demonstrated an inhibitory diameter of 20.5 mm against Escherichia coli, 23.0 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, and 21.0 mm against Salmonella thypi. The Pediococcus sp. strain produced exopolysaccharides ranging from 870 to 1910 mg/l and had 100% similarity with Pediococcus pentosaceus strain 4942. Conclusions: This study confirmed the presence of Pediococcus pentosaceus strain 4942 in budu fish, which can be used as a new probiotic based on its capabilities to kill pathogenic bacteria and produce exopolysaccharide compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development and validation of sonological classification and scoring system for uterine adenomyosis: A pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adenomyosis is a common disorder in women of reproductive age. The gold standard for diagnosis is histopathological examination of hysterectomy specimen. However, only a small percentage of women undergo surgery as treatment is primarily hormonal. Non-invasive methods of diagnosis include transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Patient management in adenomyosis is often based on ultrasonographic diagnosis alone, highlighting the importance of a uniform, reproducible, clinically relevant and validated sonological classification and scoring system. Although a few investigators have proposed classification and scoring system for diagnosis of adenomyosis, none of those have been validated yet. This study aimed to propose and validate a new sonological classification and scoring system for adenomyosis. Methods: This was a prospective observational pilot study. A new sonological classification and scoring system of adenomyosis was proposed based on topography, type, size and extent, which was validated by comparing the sonological reporting with histopathological reporting. The main outcome measures that were measured were rate of agreement (Cohen’s kappa) between the findings of sonologist and pathologist; and diagnostic accuracy of the sonological classification of adenomyosis. Results: This pilot study included 30 women who underwent hysterectomy over a time period of one year with ultrasonographic diagnosis of adenomyosis. The rate of agreement (Cohen’s kappa) between the findings of sonologist and pathologist showed substantial agreement (0.703) for topography and almost perfect agreement for type (0.896), extent (0.892) and size (0.898). Conclusions: Our newly proposed sonological classification and scoring system for adenomyosis is valid and can be used for clinical application in interpersonal communication between clinicians, to prognosticate patients about the disease severity, to assess the candidates for surgical management and in further studies to correlate with symptoms severity and effectiveness of medical therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A2TEA: Identifying trait-specific evolutionary adaptations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Plants differ in their ability to cope with external stresses (e.g., drought tolerance). Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement. Software: Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analysis. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress. Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species. We demonstrate pipeline efficiency on real-world datasets and discuss the implementation and limits of our analysis workflow as well as planned extensions to its current state. The A2TEA workflow and web application are publicly available at: https://github.com/tgstoecker/A2TEA.Workflow and https://github.com/tgstoecker/A2TEA.WebApp, respectively.

COVID-19 patients display a wide range of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to critical symptoms with high mortality risk. Our ability to understand the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells within the lung, and of protective or dysfunctional immune responses to the virus, is critical to effectively treat these patients. Currently, our understanding of cell-cell interactions across different disease states, and how such interactions may drive pathogenic outcomes, is incomplete. Here, we developed a generalizable and scalable workflow for identifying cells that are differentially interacting across COVID-19 patients with distinct disease outcomes and use this to examine eight public single-cell RNA-seq datasets (six from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, one from bronchoalveolar lavage and one from nasopharyngeal), with a total of 211 individual samples. By characterizing the cell-cell interaction patterns across epithelial and immune cells in lung tissues for patients with varying disease severity, we illustrate diverse communication patterns across individuals, and discover heterogeneous communication patterns among moderate and severe patients. We further illustrate patterns derived from cell-cell interactions are potential signatures for discriminating between moderate and severe patients. Overall, this workflow can be generalized and scaled to combine multiple scRNA-seq datasets to uncover cell-cell interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Random-effects meta-analysis of effect sizes as a unified framework for gene set analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad A. Makrooni, Dónal O’Shea, Paul Geeleher, Cathal Seoighe</p>

Gene set analysis (GSA) remains a common step in genome-scale studies because it can reveal insights that are not apparent from results obtained for individual genes. Many different computational tools are applied for GSA, which may be sensitive to different types of signals; however, most methods implicitly test whether there are differences in the distribution of the effect of some experimental condition between genes in gene sets of interest. We have developed a unifying framework for GSA that first fits effect size distributions, and then tests for differences in these distributions between gene sets. These differences can be in the proportions of genes that are perturbed or in the sign or size of the effects. Inspired by statistical meta-analysis, we take into account the uncertainty in effect size estimates by reducing the influence of genes with greater uncertainty on the estimation of distribution parameters. We demonstrate, using simulation and by application to real data, that this approach provides significant gains in performance over existing methods. Furthermore, the statistical tests carried out are defined in terms of effect sizes, rather than the results of prior statistical tests measuring these changes, which leads to improved interpretability and greater robustness to variation in sample sizes.

The modelling of many real-world problems relies on computationally heavy simulations of randomly interacting individuals or agents. However, the values of the parameters that underlie the interactions between agents are typically poorly known, and hence they need to be inferred from macroscopic observations of the system. Since statistical inference rests on repeated simulations to sample the parameter space, the high computational expense of these simulations can become a stumbling block. In this paper, we compare two ways to mitigate this issue in a Bayesian setting through the use of machine learning methods: One approach is to construct lightweight surrogate models to substitute the simulations used in inference. Alternatively, one might altogether circumvent the need for Bayesian sampling schemes and directly estimate the posterior distribution. We focus on stochastic simulations that track autonomous agents and present two case studies: tumour growths and the spread of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that good accuracy in inference can be achieved with a relatively small number of simulations, making our machine learning approaches orders of magnitude faster than classical simulation-based methods that rely on sampling the parameter space. However, we find that while some methods generally produce more robust results than others, no algorithm offers a one-size-fits-all solution when attempting to infer model parameters from observations. Instead, one must choose the inference technique with the specific real-world application in mind. The stochastic nature of the considered real-world phenomena poses an additional challenge that can become insurmountable for some approaches. Overall, we find machine learning approaches that create direct inference machines to be promising for real-world applications. We present our findings as general guidelines for modelling practitioners.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and glia are the two main cell classes in the nervous systems of most animals. Although functionally distinct, neurons and glia are both characterized by multiple branching arbors stemming from the cell bodies. Glial processes are generally known to form smaller trees than neuronal dendrites. However, the full extent of morphological differences between neurons and glia in multiple species and brain regions has not yet been characterized, nor is it known whether these cells can be reliably distinguished based on geometric features alone. Here, we show that multiple supervised learning algorithms deployed on a large database of morphological reconstructions can systematically classify neuronal and glial arbors with nearly perfect accuracy and precision. Moreover, we report multiple morphometric properties, both size related and size independent, that differ substantially between these cell types. In particular, we newly identify an individual morphometric measurement, Average Branch Euclidean Length that can robustly separate neurons from glia across multiple animal models, a broad diversity of experimental conditions, and anatomical areas, with the notable exception of the cerebellum. We discuss the practical utility and physiological interpretation of this discovery.</p>

                Pomrenze et al. investigate how dynorphin and kappa opioid receptors promote social interaction deficits during protracted opioid withdrawal. They find that kappa receptors reduce social interaction during opioid abstinence by suppressing 5-HT release in the NAc, uncovering a neural mechanism that contributes to sociability deficits associated with opioid use disorder.

                Protein lifetime in synapses is important for brain development and aging, learning, and memory. The authors show that synapses with diverse protein lifetimes are differentially distributed on neurons and in brain regions and that this architecture changes throughout the lifespan and is impacted in a model of autism and schizophrenia.
