              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10045">Unifying equivalences across unsupervised learning, network science, and imaging/network neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern scientific fields face the challenge of integrating a wealth of data, analyses, and results. We recently showed that a neglect of this integration can lead to circular analyses and redundant explanations. Here, we help advance scientific integration by describing equivalences that unify diverse analyses of datasets and networks. We describe equivalences across analyses of clustering and dimensionality reduction, network centrality and dynamics, and popular models in imaging and network neuroscience. First, we equate foundational objectives across unsupervised learning and network science (from k means to modularity to UMAP), fuse classic algorithms for optimizing these objectives, and extend these objectives to simplify interpretations of popular dimensionality reduction methods. Second, we equate basic measures of connectional magnitude and dispersion with six measures of communication, control, and diversity in network science and network neuroscience. Third, we describe three semi-analytical vignettes that clarify and simplify the interpretation of structural and dynamical analyses in imaging and network neuroscience. We illustrate our results on example brain-imaging data and provide abct, an open multi-language toolbox that implements our analyses. Together, our study unifies diverse analyses across unsupervised learning, network science, imaging neuroscience, and network neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10051">An Intelligent Infrastructure as a Foundation for Modern Science</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure shapes societies and scientific discovery. Traditional scientific infrastructure, often static and fragmented, leads to issues like data silos, lack of interoperability and reproducibility, and unsustainable short-lived solutions. Our current technical inability and social reticence to connect and coordinate scientific research and engineering leads to inefficiencies and impedes progress. With AI technologies changing how we interact with the world around us, there is an opportunity to transform scientific processes. Neuroscience's exponential growth of multimodal and multiscale data, and urgent clinical relevance demand an infrastructure itself learns, coordinates, and improves. Using neuroscience as a stress test, this perspective argues for a paradigm shift: infrastructure must evolve into a dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to accelerate science. Building on several existing principles for data, collective benefit, and digital repositories, I recommend operational guidelines for implementing them to create this dynamic ecosystem, aiming to foster a decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting system where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly. Addressing the chronic underfunding of scientific infrastructure, acknowledging diverse contributions beyond publications, and coordinating global efforts are critical steps for this transformation. By prioritizing an intelligent infrastructure as a central scientific instrument for knowledge generation, we can overcome current limitations, accelerate discovery, ensure reproducibility and ethical practices, and ultimately translate neuroscientific understanding into tangible societal benefits, setting a blueprint for other scientific domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10057">Large Language Models Show Signs of Alignment with Human Neurocognition During Abstract Reasoning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically, every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive correlations were observed between the representational geometries of task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10062">Excessive Screen Time is Associated with Mental Health Problems and ADHD in US Children and Adolescents: Physical Activity and Sleep as Parallel Mediators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To examine associations between screen time and anxiety, depression, behavior or conduct problems, and ADHD among children and adolescents during the pandemic, and to assess whether physical activity, sleep duration, and bedtime regularity mediate these associations. Data from 50231 US children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in the 2020 to 2021 National Survey of Childrens Health were analyzed. Exact natural effect models and structural equation modeling assessed mediation by physical activity, short sleep duration, and irregular bedtime. We found that daily screen time equal or more than 4 hours was linked to higher risks of anxiety (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.32, 1.58), depression (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.41, 1.93), behavior or conduct problems (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.30), and ADHD (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11, 1.33). Physical activity accounted for 30.2% to 39.3% of the association, irregular bedtime for 18.2% to 25.7%, and short sleep duration for 2.77% to 7.34%. Excessive screen time was associated with poorer mental health and ADHD, partly explained by reduced physical activity, irregular bedtime, and insufficient sleep. Interventions should promote physical activity, regular sleep routines, and adequate sleep duration to effectively mitigate mental health issues and ADHD among children and adolescents.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10064">Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn, offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation principles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10130">Linking GFAP Levels to Speech Anomalies in Acute Brain Injury: A Simulation Based Study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a biomarker for intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, but its link to acute speech disruption is untested. Speech anomalies often emerge early after injury, enabling rapid triage.
  Methods: We simulated a cohort of 200 virtual patients stratified by lesion location, onset time, and severity. GFAP kinetics followed published trajectories; speech anomalies were generated from lesion-specific neurophysiological mappings. Ensemble machine-learning models used GFAP, speech, and lesion features; robustness was tested under noise, delays, and label dropout. Causal inference (inverse probability of treatment weighting and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) estimated directional associations between GFAP elevation and speech severity.
  Findings: GFAP correlated with simulated speech anomaly severity (Spearman rho = 0.48), strongest for cortical lesions (rho = 0.55). Voice anomalies preceded detectable GFAP rise by a median of 42 minutes in cortical injury. Classifier area under the curve values were 0.74 (GFAP only), 0.78 (voice only), and 0.86 for the fused multimodal model, which showed higher sensitivity in mild or ambiguous cases. Causal estimates indicated higher GFAP increased the modeled probability of moderate-to-severe speech anomalies by 32 to 35 percent, independent of lesion site and onset time.
  Conclusion: These results support a link between GFAP elevation and speech anomalies in acute brain injury and suggest integrated biochemical-voice diagnostics could improve early triage, especially for cortical injury. Findings are simulation-based and require validation in prospective clinical studies with synchronized GFAP assays and speech recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10784">Insights from the Algonauts 2025 Winners</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli. Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos; the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed 4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10343">Scalable Modeling of Nonlinear Network Dynamics in Neurodegenerative Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic models of progressive neurodegeneration offer great potential utility for clinical use and novel treatment development. Toward this end, several connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been proposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small number of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories and a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the Connectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND). The model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural brain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while maintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate our model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers Initiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging representations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce biomarker number.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10474">EDAPT: Towards Calibration-Free BCIs with Continual Online Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.10474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10586">Differential Physiological Responses to Proxemic and Facial Threats in Virtual Avatar Interactions</a></h4>

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications. While previous research has established that users respond to personal space violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression (neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV, reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19657">Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of reservoir recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.19657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we investigate how the computational ability of reservoir recurrent neural networks (RNNs) scales with an increasing number of readout neurons. First, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir RNN scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity that incorporates the effect of neuronal correlations, which have been ignored in prior theoretical work for analytical simplicity. Our theory successfully relates the sublinear scaling of memory capacity to the strength of neuronal correlations. Furthermore, we show this principle holds across diverse types of RNNs, even those beyond the direct applicability of our theory. Next, we numerically investigate the scaling behavior of nonlinear computational ability, which, alongside memory capacity, is crucial for overall computational performance. Our numerical simulations reveal that as memory capacity growth becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

                arXiv:2508.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.

Abstract: This project explores emoji prediction from short text sequences using four deep learning architectures: a feed-forward network, CNN, transformer, and BERT. Using the TweetEval dataset, we address class imbalance through focal loss and regularization techniques. Results show BERT achieves the highest overall performance due to its pre-training advantage, while CNN demonstrates superior efficacy on rare emoji classes. This research shows the importance of architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning for sentiment-aware emoji prediction, contributing to improved human-computer interaction.

                arXiv:2508.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability. Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive, graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

                arXiv:2312.15805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems, where information is transmitted through action potentials in a bio-plausible fashion, is gaining increasing interest due to its promise of low-power event-driven computing. Application of neuromorphic computing in robotic locomotion research have largely focused on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for bionics robotic control algorithms - inspired from neural circuits governing the collaboration of the limb muscles in animal movement. Implementation of artificial CPGs on neuromorphic hardware platforms can potentially enable adaptive and energy-efficient edge robotics applications in resource constrained environments. However, underlying rewiring mechanisms in CPG for gait emergence process is not well understood. This work addresses the missing gap in literature pertaining to CPG plasticity and underscores the critical homeostatic functionality of astrocytes - a cellular component in the brain that is believed to play a major role in multiple brain functions. This paper introduces an astrocyte regulated Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based CPG for learning locomotion gait through Reward-Modulated STDP for quadruped robots, where the astrocytes help build inhibitory connections among the artificial motor neurons in different limbs. The SNN-based CPG is simulated on a multi-object physics simulation platform resulting in the emergence of a trotting gait while running the robot on flat ground. $23.3\times$ computational power savings is observed in comparison to a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based robot control algorithm. Such a neuroscience-algorithm co-design approach can potentially enable a quantum leap in the functionality of neuromorphic systems incorporating glial cell functionality.

                arXiv:2407.07014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the spiking behavior of biological neurons and are typically deployed on distributed-memory neuromorphic hardware. The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units.
  However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization.
  To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model.
  We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation.
  Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.

                arXiv:2411.04293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored for combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available (Github public repository: github.com/RKO-solver), is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning and computer vision. One promising, yet only preliminarily explored approach, is feature inversion, which attempts to reconstruct images from intermediate representations using trained inverse neural networks. In this study, we revisit feature inversion, introducing a novel, modular variation that enables significantly more efficient application of the technique. We demonstrate how our method can be systematically applied to the large-scale transformer-based vision models, Detection Transformer and Vision Transformer, and how reconstructed images can be qualitatively interpreted in a meaningful way. We further quantitatively evaluate our method, thereby uncovering underlying mechanisms of representing image features that emerge in the two transformer architectures. Our analysis reveals key insights into how these models encode contextual shape and image details, how their layers correlate, and their robustness against color perturbations. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models and their internal representations. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-tvm.

">Unveiling the neuro-vascular interplay in the skeletal muscle in health, injury and disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are complex multicellular structures that convey motor neuron-induced responses in the skeletal muscle. Their cellular composition is well characterized, but interactions between the different cell types and with the surrounding microenvironment remain underexplored. Here, by using a panel of newly discovered mouse cell lineage markers, single-cell RNA sequencing analyses and iDisco tissue clarification, we demonstrate the existence of contacts between adjacent NMJs through their kranocytes, assembling kranocyte network-like structures within the muscle interstitium, which is essential for regulating blood flow and supporting muscle regeneration. Indeed, kranocytes do contact with the surrounding microvasculature as well, both of them uncovering a previously unexplored, expansive interactive system. Moreover, unlike the robustness shown by their counterparts, the terminal Schwann cells, we strikingly observed that kranocytes rapidly detected stressful conditions, leading to structural changes and even the loss of their connections in response to acute damage, such as muscle injury or neuromuscular disease-induced denervation. Therefore, we propose kranocytes as the interactive sensory platforms of the NMJs, working in a perpendicular axis of nerve-transmission, as key NMJ-connectors by, interconnecting adjacent NMJs and interacting with the microvasculature and the microenvironment, and also as NMJ-sensors by detecting microenvironmental inputs. Together, our data postulate kranocytes as triple connectors of the nervous, musculoskeletal and vascular systems.

">A unified derivative-like dopaminergic computation across valences</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine activity in the brain affects decision-making and adaptive behaviors. A wealth of studies indicate that dopamine activity encodes discrepancy between actual and predicted reward, leading to the reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis. Specifically, it has been claimed that mesolimbic dopamine activity conforms to temporal-difference reward prediction error (TD RPE), a teaching signal in machine learning algorithms. Recently, there is growing evidence suggesting that dopamine is also involved in learning during aversive situations. However, the fundamental computation of dopamine activity in aversive situations is still unknown. A plausible but untested hypothesis is that dopamine activity in aversive situations also encodes TD RPE. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using mice in virtual reality. Mice were trained to avoid electrical tail shocks by running out of a virtual shock zone. Using probe conditions with speed manipulation or teleportation, we revealed that the dopamine signal in the ventral striatum follows the temporal derivative form of a value function. Delivering a reward at the end of the track enabled us to observe the integration of aversion and reward in a derivative form. Moreover, the value functions unbiasedly estimated from the recorded signal is consistent with the initial hypothetical form, with a realistic reflection of a received shock distribution. Taken together, our results show that mesolimbic dopamine activity can operate as a unified teaching signal in natural situations with positive and negative valences.

">Obsessive-Compulsive Tendencies Shift the Balance Between Competitive Neurocognitive Processes</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical models of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) propose that its symptoms stem from an imbalance between habitual and goal-directed processes, marked by a bias toward habitual behavior and deficits in goal-directed control. While much of the existing research has focused on reward-based learning, the contribution of reward-independent learning processes to this imbalance remains unclear. To address this gap, the present study investigated the interaction between statistical learning (SL), a form of reward-free learning, and cognitive flexibility, a key goal-directed function, in a non-clinical population. By adopting a dimensional approach to obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, this work aims to overcome the limitations of categorical diagnoses and better capture the continuous, nuanced variability of symptoms, while clarifying how specific neurocognitive processes relate to OC tendencies. A total of 402 participants from the non-clinical population completed an online study involving the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess SL and a Card Sorting Task to measure cognitive flexibility. Our findings revealed a competitive relationship between SL and cognitive flexibility. Critically, this inverse association weakened as OC tendencies increased, suggesting that even at non-clinical levels, OC tendencies may interfere with the typical interplay between automatic and goal-directed processes. Notably, SL performance remained intact, and the observed effects were not attributable to reward sensitivity, as learning occurred without external feedback. These findings emphasize the value of examining non-clinical OC tendencies and highlight the importance of investigating neurocognitive system interactions, rather than isolated functions, in advancing our understanding of OCD.

                <p>Fiber photometry is a neuroscience technique that can continuously monitor in vivo fluorescence to assess population neural activity or neuropeptide/transmitter release in freely behaving animals. Despite the widespread adoption of this technique, methods to statistically analyze data in an unbiased, objective, and easily adopted manner are lacking. Various pipelines for data analysis exist, but they are often system specific, are only for preprocessing data, and/or lack usability. Current post hoc statistical approaches involve inadvertently biased user-defined time-binned averages or area under the curve analysis. To date, no post hoc user-friendly tool with few assumptions for a standardized unbiased analysis exists, yet such a tool would improve reproducibility and statistical reliability for all users. Hence, we have developed a user-friendly post hoc statistical analysis package in Python that is easily downloaded and applied to data from any fiber photometry system. This Fiber Photometry Post Hoc Analysis (FiPhoPHA) package incorporates a variety of tools, a downsampler, bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) for analyzing peri-event signals between groups and compared with baseline, and permutation tests for comparing peri-event signals across comparison periods. We also include the ability to quickly and efficiently sort the data into mean time bins, if desired. This provides an open-source, user-friendly Python package for unbiased and standardized post hoc statistical analysis to improve reproducibility using data from any fiber photometry system.</p>

Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to assess physical properties of brain connections. Here, we present an integrative ecosystem of software that performs all steps of tractometry: post-processing of dMRI data, delineation of major white matter pathways, and modeling of the tissue properties within them. This ecosystem also provides a set of interoperable and extensible tools for visualization and interpretation of the results that extract insights from these measurements. These include novel machine learning and statistical analysis methods adapted to the characteristic structure of tract-based data. We benchmark the performance of these statistical analysis methods in different datasets and analysis tasks, including hypothesis testing on group differences and predictive analysis of subject age. We also demonstrate that computational advances implemented in the software offer orders of magnitude of acceleration. Taken together, these open-source software tools—freely available at https://tractometry.org—provide a transformative environment for the analysis of dMRI data.

                <p>by Matt J. Owen, Gary R. Mirams</p>

Ion channel models present many challenging optimisation problems. These include unidentifiable parameters, noisy data, unobserved states, and a combination of both fast and slow timescales. This can make it difficult to choose a suitable optimisation routine <i>a priori</i>. Nevertheless, many attempts have been made to design optimisation routines specifically for ion channel models, however, little work has been done to compare these optimisation approaches. We have developed ionBench, an open-source optimisation benchmarking framework, to evaluate and compare these approaches against a standard set of ion channel optimisation problems. We included implementations of thirty-four unique optimisation approaches that have been previously applied to ion channel models and evaluated them against the ionBench test suite, consisting of five parameter optimisation problems derived from the cardiac ion channel literature. Each optimisation approach was initiated from multiple starting parameters and tasked with reproducing a problem-specific simulated dataset. Through ionBench, we tracked and evaluated the performance of these optimisations, identifying the expected run time until a successful optimisation for each approach, which was used for comparisons. Finally, we used these results, in addition to other literature results, to identify a new efficient approach. Its use could reduce computation time by multiple orders of magnitude, while also improving the reliability of ion channel parameter optimisation.

Many-author non-empirical papers include “how to” articles, recommendations or consensus statements, roadmaps for future research, catalogs of ideas, or calls to action. These papers benefit the research community and broader academic ecosystem by addressing unmet needs or introducing new perspectives and approaches. Large, diverse authorship teams that examine an issue from many different perspectives can create valuable resources that individual co-authors could not develop independently, or in smaller groups. Realizing the potential of many-author non-empirical papers, however, requires very different strategies than researchers would typically use to write papers with fewer authors. In our process, a core team of lead writers typically works together to lead the content generation and writing processes, while many co-authors collaboratively create content and provide feedback on outlines and drafts. Challenges for co-authors may include learning to write a different type of paper, adapting to high-volume feedback, and understanding the very diverse perspectives shared by fellow co-authors. This paper outlines ten simple rules for being a co-author on a many-author non-empirical paper. Although the rules were developed for papers with at least 30 authors, some rules may be useful for many-author research papers or for non-empirical papers with fewer authors. Co-authors may also want to consult our companion paper on ten simple rules for leading a many-author non-empirical paper, as understanding the challenges faced by lead writers will help co-authors to contribute more efficiently and effectively.

Many-author non-empirical papers include recommendations or consensus statements, catalogs of ideas, roadmaps for future research, calls to action, or “how to” articles. These papers have great potential to change the conversation or address unmet needs within research communities. Large, diverse authorship teams can create valuable resources that no individual co-author could create independently. Achieving these goals, however, requires a very different approach than researchers typically use to prepare papers with fewer authors. In the process we describe, a small team of lead writers typically leads the content generation and writing processes. Many co-authors collaborate to create content and provide feedback throughout the writing process. Lead writers face many challenges, including defining the content and structure of the paper, coordinating complex logistics, preparing themselves and co-authors for a unique writing experience, and managing high-volume feedback. Here, we outline ten simple rules for leading a many-author non-empirical paper. These rules guide readers through the content generation and writing processes and highlight practical solutions to common challenges. While these rules were developed by preparing non-empirical papers with at least 30 authors, some rules may apply to research papers or non-empirical papers with fewer authors. Lead writers can also use our companion paper, which shares ten simple rules for being a co-author on a many-author non-empirical paper, to prepare co-authors for an efficient and effective collaborative process.

                <p>by Antoinette Fang, Lakshin Kumar, Kate E. Creevy, Daniel E.L. Promislow, Jing Ma, the Dog Aging Project Consortium </p>

Comorbidity and its association with age are of great interest in geroscience. However, there are few model organisms that are well-suited to study comorbidities that will have high relevance to humans. In this light, we turn our attention to the companion dog. The companion dog shares many morbidities with humans. Thus, a better understanding of canine comorbidity relationships could benefit both humans and dogs. We present an analysis of canine comorbidity networks from the Dog Aging Project, a large epidemiological cohort study of companion dogs in the United States. We included owner-reported health conditions that occurred in at least 60 dogs (n = 160) and included only dogs that had at least one of those health conditions (n = 26,614). We constructed an undirected comorbidity network using a Poisson binomial test, adjusting for age, sex, sterilization status, breed background (i.e., purebred vs. mixed-breed), and weight. The comorbidity network reveals well-documented comorbidities, such as diabetes with cataracts and blindness, and hypertension with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, this network also supports less well-studied comorbidity relationships, such as proteinuria with anemia. A directed comorbidity network accounting for time of reported condition onset suggests that diabetes precedes cataracts, elbow/hip dysplasia before osteoarthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca before corneal ulcer, which are consistent with the canine literature. Analysis of age-stratified networks reveals that global centrality measures increase with age and are the highest in the Senior group compared to the Young Adult and Mature Adult groups. Only the Senior group identified the association between hypertension and CKD. Our results suggest that comorbidity network analysis is a promising method to enhance clinical knowledge and canine healthcare management.

Structural changes involving new neurons can occur through stem cell-driven neurogenesis, and through incorporation of late-maturing “immature” neurons into networks, namely undifferentiated neuronal precursors frozen in a state of arrested maturation. The latter have been found in the cerebral cortex and are particularly abundant in large-brained mammals, covarying with the size of the brain and cortex. Similar cells have been described in the amygdala of some species, although their features and interspecies variation remain poorly understood. Here, their occurrence, number, morphology, molecular expression, age-related changes, and anatomical distribution in amygdala subdivisions were systematically analyzed in eight diverse mammalian species (including mouse, naked mole rat, rabbit, marmoset, cat, sheep, horse, and chimpanzee) widely differing in neuroanatomy, brain size, life span, and socioecology. We identify converging evidence that these amygdala cells are immature neurons and show marked phylogenetic variation, with a significantly greater prevalence in primates. The immature cells are largely located within the amygdala’s basolateral complex, a region that has expanded in primate brain evolution in conjunction with cortical projections. In addition, amygdala immature neurons also appear to stabilize in number through adulthood and old age, unlike other forms of plasticity that undergo marked age-related reduction. These results support the emerging view that large brains performing complex socio-cognitive functions rely on wide reservoirs of immature neurons.

                <p>by Jinlong Wan, Jiahui Yi, Xiao Sun, Evan Siemann, Matthias Erb, Wei Huang</p>

Plants encounter natural antagonist threats of varying intensity and respond by activating multiple defense traits. Due to the fitness costs associated with producing defense traits, plants are expected to activate less costly traits first, reserving more costly defenses for potentially more severe damage (“cheaper first hypothesis”), but evidence to date is scarce. Here, we tested this hypothesis by measuring six putative defense traits in the annual plant <i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i>. We found that all traits were effective against insect herbivores, but production of three of them more strongly reduced plant growth, suggesting higher growth costs. When plants were attacked by insect herbivores, less costly traits were induced first, even at the lowest levels of damage, while more costly traits were activated only after higher damage thresholds. This cost-dependent sequential pattern was consistently observed in plants when challenged by 12 different herbivore species from three insect orders. These findings demonstrate that plants can employ the “cheaper first” sequential induction defense strategy, potentially allowing them to reduce defense costs and maximize fitness. Our study provides new insights into how plants fine-tune their defense responses under variable antagonistic pressures.

                <p>by Ali Rezaei, Corson N. Areshenkoff, Daniel J. Gale, Anouk J. De Brouwer, Joseph Y. Nashed, J. Randall Flanagan, Jason P. Gallivan</p>

An often-desired feature of motor learning is that it generalizes to untrained scenarios. Yet, how this is supported by brain activity remains poorly understood. Here we show, using human functional MRI and a sensorimotor adaptation task involving the transfer of learning from the trained to untrained hand, that the transfer phase of adaptation re-instantiates a highly similar large-scale pattern of brain activity to that observed during initial adaptation. Notably, we find that these neural changes, rather than occurring at the level of sensorimotor regions, predominantly occur across distributed areas of higher-order transmodal cortex, specifically in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, we show that these learning-related neural changes relate to the structural properties of transmodal cortex (its myelin content and neurotransmitter receptor density), and that intersubject differences in DMN activity relate to both adaptation- and transfer-phase task performance. Together, these findings suggest that the transfer of learning across the hands is supported by the re-expression of the same activity patterns in the DMN as those that support initial learning. Collectively, these results offer a unique characterization of the whole-brain macroscale changes associated with sensorimotor learning and generalization, and establish a key role for higher-order brain areas, such as the DMN, in the transfer of learning to untrained scenarios.

                <p>by Burcu Tepekule, Ai Ing Lim, Charlotte Jessica E. Metcalf</p>

To achieve immune and microbial homeostasis during adulthood, the developing immune system must learn to identify which microbes to tolerate and which to defend against. How such ‘immune education’ unfolds remains a major knowledge gap. We address this gap by synthesizing existing literature to develop a mechanistic mathematical model representing the interplay between gut ecology and adaptive immunity in humans during early life. Our results indicate that the inflammatory tone of the microenvironment is the mediator of information flow from pre- to post-weaning periods. We evaluate the power of postnatal fecal samples for predicting immunological trajectories and explore breastfeeding scenarios when maternal immunological conditions affect breastmilk composition. Our work establishes a quantitative basis for ‘immune education’, yielding insights into questions of applied relevance.

                <p>by Romain Strock, Valerie W.C. Soo, Pauline Misson, Georgia Roumelioti, Pavel V. Shliaha, Antoine Hocher, Tobias Warnecke</p>

The social life of archaea is poorly understood. In particular, even though competition and conflict are common themes in microbial communities, there is scant evidence documenting antagonistic interactions between archaea and their abundant prokaryotic brethren: bacteria. Do archaea specifically target bacteria for destruction? If so, what molecular weaponry do they use? Here, we present an approach to infer antagonistic interactions between archaea and bacteria from genome sequence. We show that a large and diverse set of archaea encode peptidoglycan hydrolases, enzymes that recognize and cleave a structure—peptidoglycan—that is a ubiquitous component of bacterial cell walls but absent from archaea. We predict the bacterial targets of archaeal peptidoglycan hydrolases using a structural homology approach and demonstrate that the predicted target bacteria tend to inhabit a similar niche to the archaeal producer, indicative of ecologically relevant interactions. Using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that two peptidoglycan hydrolases from the halophilic archaeaon <i>Halogranum salarium</i> B-1 kill the halophilic bacterium <i>Halalkalibacterium halodurans,</i> a predicted target, and do so in a manner consistent with peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Our results suggest that, even though the tools and rules of engagement remain largely unknown, archaeal-bacterial conflicts are likely common, and we present a roadmap for the discovery of additional antagonistic interactions between these two domains of life. Our work has implications for understanding mixed microbial communities that include archaea and suggests that archaea might represent a large untapped reservoir of novel antibacterials.

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and is also observed in the brains of elderly individuals without such conditions, suggesting that aging drives the accumulation of protein aggregates. However, the comprehensive understanding of age-dependent protein aggregates involved in brain aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated proteins that become sarkosyl-insoluble with age and identified hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2), a hyaluronic acid-binding protein of the extracellular matrix at the nodes of Ranvier, as an age-dependent aggregating protein in mouse brains. Elevated hyaluronic acid levels and impaired microglial function reduced the clearance of HAPLN2, leading to its accumulation. HAPLN2 oligomers induced microglial inflammatory responses both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, age-associated HAPLN2 aggregation was also observed in the human cerebellum. These findings suggest that HAPLN2 aggregation results from age-related decline in brain homeostasis and may exacerbate the brain environment by activating microglia. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cerebellar aging and highlights the role of HAPLN2 in age-associated changes in the brain.

                Winter et al. synthesize recent advances in the understanding of spinal projecting neurons—a specialized population of brain neurons that extend axons into the spinal cord to regulate motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The authors propose a conceptual framework for understanding brain-control of bodily functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106611">Occupancy of the HbYX hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to induce gate opening in the archaeal 20S proteasomes</a></h4>

              
                Enhancing proteasome function has been a long-standing but challenging target of interest for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the importance of understanding proteasome activation mechanisms. Most proteasome activator complexes use the C-terminal HbYX (hydrophobic-tyrosine-almost any residue) motif to bind and trigger gate-opening in the 20 S proteasome. This study defines a critical molecular interaction in the HbYX mechanism that triggers gate opening. We focus on the Hb site interaction and find it plays a surprisingly central and crucial role in driving the allosteric conformational changes that induce gate opening in the archaeal 20 S. We examined the cryo-EM structure of two mutant archaeal proteasomes, αV24Y T20S and αV24F T20S. These two mutants were engineered to place a bulky aromatic residue in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket; both mutants are highly active, though their mechanisms of activation are undefined. Collectively, our findings indicate that the interaction between the Hb group of the HbYX motif and its corresponding hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to induce gate opening in a mechanistically similar way to the HbYX motif. The activation mechanism studied here involves the expansion of the hydrophobic binding site, allosterically altering the state of the IT switch, thus triggering gate opening. Furthermore, we show that the canonical αK66 residue, previously understood to be critical for proteasome activator binding, also plays a key role in stabilizing the open gate, irrespective of activator binding. This study differentiates between the residues in the HbYX motif that support binding interactions (‘YX’) versus those that allosterically contribute to gate opening (‘Hb’). The insights reported here will guide future drug development efforts, particularly in designing small molecule proteasome activators, by targeting the identified hydrophobic pocket.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97100">Syngap1 regulates the synaptic drive and membrane excitability of Parvalbumin-positive interneurons in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) is characterized by moderate to severe ID, generalized epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, sensory processing dysfunction, and other behavioral abnormalities. While numerous studies have highlighted a role of Syngap1 in cortical excitatory neurons development, recent studies suggest that Syngap1 plays a role in GABAergic inhibitory neuron development as well. However, the molecular pathways by which Syngap1 acts on GABAergic neurons, and whether they are similar or different from the mechanisms underlying its effects in excitatory neurons, are unknown. Here, we examined whether, and how, embryonic-onset <i>Syngap1</i> haploinsufficiency restricted to GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) impacts their synaptic and intrinsic properties in adult primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that <i>Syngap1</i> haploinsufficiency significantly affected the intrinsic properties, overall leading to increased firing threshold and decreased excitatory synaptic drive in Parvalbumin (PV)+ neurons in adult layer IV A1. Further, the AMPA component of thalamocortical evoked EPSC was decreased in PV+ cells from mutant mice. Mutant somatostatin (SST)+ interneurons exhibited decreased spontaneous excitatory input and impaired evoked firing without alterations in firing threshold. Finally, we found that the selective blocking of voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents was sufficient to rescue PV+ mutant cell-intrinsic properties to wild-type levels. Together, these data suggest that <i>Syngap1</i> plays a specific role in the maturation of PV+ cell-intrinsic properties and synaptic drive, and its haploinsufficiency may lead to reduced PV cell recruitment in the adult A1, which could in turn contribute to the auditory processing alterations found in SYNGAP1-ID preclinical models and patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94165">Progressively shifting patterns of co-modulation among premotor cortex neurons carry dynamically similar signals during action execution and observation</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in macaque premotor cortex show firing rate modulation whether the subject performs an action or observes another individual performing a similar action. Although such mirror neurons have been thought to have highly congruent discharge during execution and observation, many, if not most, show noncongruent activity. Studies of reaching movements, for which low-dimensional neural trajectories exhibit comparatively simple dynamical motifs, have shown that these prevalent patterns of co-modulation pass through subspaces which are shared in part, but in part are visited exclusively during either execution or observation. The neural dynamics of hand movements are more complex, however. We developed a novel approach to examine prevalent patterns of co-modulation during execution and observation of a task that involved reaching, grasping, and manipulation. Rather than following neural trajectories in subspaces that contain their entire time course, we identified time series of instantaneous subspaces, calculated principal angles among them, sampled trajectory segments at the times of selected behavioral events, and projected those segments into the time series of instantaneous subspaces. These instantaneous neural subspaces most often remained distinct during execution versus observation. Nevertheless, latent dynamics during execution and observation could be partially aligned with canonical correlation, indicating some similarity of the relationships among neural representations of different movements relative to one another during execution and observation. We also found that during action execution, mirror neurons showed consistent patterns of co-modulation both within and between sessions, but other non-mirror neurons that were modulated only during action execution and not during observation showed considerable variability of co-modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103321">Interplay of YEATS2 and GCDH regulates histone crotonylation and drives EMT in head and neck cancer</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of gene expression is an integral cellular process orchestrated by epigenetic marks like histone modifications. Perturbations in the activity or abundance of epigenetic factors can lead to tumorigenesis. Remarkably, several metabolites influence the epigenetic landscape in cells. Here, we investigated the interplay between a highly expressed epigenetic factor, YEATS2, and a metabolic enzyme, GCDH, in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in head and neck cancer. We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high promoter H3K27cr levels by assisting in the recruitment of crotonyltransferase p300 at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene <i>SPARC</i>. Furthermore, we found that the addition of the H3K27cr mark is also dependent on the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme GCDH. Overall, we describe a novel mechanism of interplay between epigenetics and metabolism in head and neck tumorigenesis, which results in the enhanced expression of EMT-related genes in a histone crotonylation-dependent manner.

">ROSMAP-Compass: A data-harmonised, AI-ready atlas of 22 million single nuclei from the ROSMAP cohort</a></h4>

              
                The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort has generated the world's most comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic resource for Alzheimer's disease research. Naturally, in a project spanning multiple years with dozens of research groups involved, the resulting data landscape shows fragmentation across sequencing chemistries, protocols, and pipelines. This presents both a challenge and a unique opportunity for harmonized, collaborative analysis. Following an early data integration strategy and complete realignment of all single nucleus RNA sequencing data, we generated a fully harmonized resource: ROSMAP-Compass, comprising more than 22 million high-quality nuclei from 2,058 donors in multiple brain regions from the ROSMAP and Neuro Psychiatric Symptoms (NPS-AD) cohorts. Through systematic curation and unified reprocessing, we addressed substantial technical challenges including chemistry-specific biases, cross-study batch effects, and sample redundancies across multiple studies spanning different time periods and research groups. ROSMAP-Compass demonstrates the critical importance of systematic data harmonization when integrating large-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources. By combining open science principles with cutting-edge AI integration, we provide both a critical resource for understanding Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity and a blueprint for making complex biomedical data accessible to the global research community. The full resource, interactive web portal, and LLM compatible API are freely available, empowering researchers worldwide to accelerate discovery in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Tunneling Nanotube-like Connections in the Developing Cerebellum: Distinct from Cytokinetic and Intercellular Bridges</a></h4>

              
                Intercellular communication is essential for brain development. While classical communication modes-such as paracrine, juxtacrine and synaptic signaling-are well characterized, emerging evidence suggests that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), membranous bridges primarily observed in vitro, may also contribute. However, their presence and function in vivo remain unclear, partly due to the challenge of distinguishing them from other types of intercellular connections (ICs). Building on prior evidence of ICs in the external granule layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, we investigated their nature in postnatal day 7 (P7) mice. Using immunofluorescence and genetically sparse labeling, we distinguished cytokinetic bridges (CBs), transient connections formed between daughter cells during the final stage of cell division, and intercellular bridges (IBs), more stable connections that persist after division, from TNT-like structures, which form independently of cell division. We observed CBs but not IBs in the EGL. We also observed TNT-like connections throughout the EGL, which appeared to connect both clonally and non-clonally related cells. The presence of these TNT-like structures in the developing EGL suggests that TNT-like connections may contribute to intercellular communication, paving the way for further study of a previously unrecognized mechanism that could influence neuronal fate, migration, and network formation during cerebellar development.

                <p>Sensory-motor control requires the integration and monitoring of sensory feedback resulting from our behaviors. This self-monitoring is thought to result from comparisons between predictions about the expected sensory consequences of action and the feedback actually received, resulting in activity that encodes feedback error. Although similar mechanisms have been proposed during speech and vocal production, including sensitivity to experimentally perturbed auditory feedback, evidence for a vocal "error signal" has been limited. Here, we recorded from the auditory cortex of vocalizing nonhuman primates, using real-time frequency shifts to introduce feedback errors of varying magnitude and direction. We found neural activity that scaled with the magnitude of feedback error in both directions, consistent with vocal error monitoring at both the individual unit and population levels. This feedback sensitivity was greater than expected based upon passive sensory responses and was specific for units in the vocal frequency range. Feedback responses also predicted subsequent compensatory changes in vocal production. These results provide evidence that the auditory cortex encodes the degree of vocal feedback error using both unit-level error calculations and changes in the population of neurons involved. These mechanisms may provide critical error information necessary for feedback-dependent vocal control.</p>

                <p>Rapsyn is a scaffold protein that is thought to anchor acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We showed that it may be an E3 ligase that regulates NMJ development by neddylation. To obtain genetical evidence, we mutated Nae1 (APP-BP1), an obligatory subunit of the neddylation E1 enzyme specifically in muscle cells. The mutation decreased the stability of acetylcholine receptor (AChR)&alpha;, reduced AChR clustering, and impaired NMJ development in <I>Pax7-Cre;Nae1f/f</I> mice (of either sex) and caused neonatal lethality. Moreover, while NMJs were normal in heterozygous mutant mice of Nae1 or rapsyn C366A (a knock-in mutation that eliminates E3 ligase activity), double heterozygous mutant mice (of either sex) displayed NMJ deficits, indicative of a genetic interaction between Nae1 and rapsyn. These results provide genetic evidence for a role of neddylation in NMJ formation and support the notion that rapsyn serves as a neddylation E3 ligase in NMJ formation.</p>

                <p>Learning new sequential movements is a fundamental skill for many animals. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of "what" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode "how" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the "what" and "how" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms in a continuous reaching task by varying how many upcoming targets were visible. When participants (<I>n</I> = 14, 8F) could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated faster movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one-target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning driven by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments (<I>n</I> = 42, 21F) revealed that the learned sequence representations did not generalize in extrinsic coordinates across limbs and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm dissociates between the "what" and "how" components of motor sequence learning and provides evidence for the development of motoric sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.</p>

                <p>Rhythms at a population level are a defining characteristic of both normal and pathological cortical activities, but it is unclear how such rhythms interact with the activity of specific neurons to impact task performance on a trial-by-trial basis. We address this by employing a challenging visual detection task in which male rhesus macaques must signal the presentation of a shape embedded in a noisy background. We analyzed the rhythmic activity in the local field potential (LFP) and single neuron activity in area V4, a brain area strongly implicated in shape perception, prior to such presentations and focused on two different frequency ranges: alpha/beta (10&ndash;30 Hz), in which coherence was particularly strong and spatially extensive, and gamma (50&ndash;70 Hz), which has traditionally been strongly associated with single unit activity. We find that within sessions, there were periods of time during which successful detection was associated with the absence of rhythmic activity prior to shape presentation in either frequency range. During these periods, rhythmic quiescence prior to shape presentation could predict whether the shape would be detected by the animal with high accuracy. Importantly, for both frequency ranges, the individual neurons carrying the most relevant information with regard to the task had the weakest coupling to LFP rhythms. These results are consistent with spatially distributed rhythmic activity acting as a source of decision noise in the context of rapid visual detection by reducing the moment-to-moment reliability of task-relevant information carried by individual neurons.</p>

                <p>Dopamine is an important neuromodulator found throughout the central nervous system that can influence neural circuits involved in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. In the retina, dopamine is released by specific amacrine cells and plays a role in reconfiguring circuits for photopic vision. This adaptation takes place both in photoreceptors and at postreceptoral sites. The AII amacrine cell, which plays a crucial role for transmission of both scotopic and photopic visual signals, has been considered an important target of dopaminergic modulation, expressed as a change in the strength of electrical coupling mediated by gap junctions between the AIIs. It has been difficult, however, to find clear evidence for expression of dopamine receptors by AII amacrines. Here, we combined injection of fluorescent dye in AIIs with immunolabeling of type 1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs) and made the surprising observation that D1Rs, along with KCNQ2, an M-type K<sup>+</sup> channel, are expressed at the AII axon initial segment-like process (AII-AIS) that also expresses voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<SUB>v</SUB>) channels and generates action potentials. With current-clamp recording of AIIs in rat (male, female) retinal slices, we found that D1R activation reduced spike frequency and increased spike threshold. Taken together with experiments using immunolabeling, pharmacological manipulation, and computational modeling, our results suggest that activation of D1Rs on AIIs reduces the intrinsic excitability of these cells, likely mediated by an intracellular signal transduction pathway involving cAMP, PKA, and phosphorylation of Na<SUB>v</SUB> channels in the AII-AIS. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the role of dopamine in retinal adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/33/e0800242025?rss=1">Identification of New Ciliary Signaling Pathways in the Brain and Insights into Neurological Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primary cilia are conserved sensory hubs essential for signaling transduction and embryonic development. Ciliary dysfunction causes a variety of developmental syndromes with neurological features and cognitive impairment whose basis mostly remains unknown. Despite connections to neural function, the primary cilium remains an overlooked organelle in the brain. Most neurons have a primary cilium; however, it is still unclear how this organelle modulates brain architecture and function, given the lack of any systemic dissection of neuronal ciliary signaling. Here, we present the first in vivo glance at the molecular composition of cilia in the mouse brain. We have adapted in vivo proximity-dependent biotin identification (iBioID), targeting the biotin ligase BioID2 to primary cilia in neurons of male and female mice. We identified tissue-specific signaling networks residing in neuronal cilia, including Eph/Ephrin signaling. We also uncovered a novel connection between primary cilia and gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling. Our iBioID ciliary network presents a wealth of new and neural-specific ciliary signaling proteins and yields new insights into neurological disorders. Our findings are a promising first step in defining the fundamentals of ciliary signaling and their roles in shaping neural circuits and behavior. In the future, this work can be extended to pathological conditions of the brain, with the goal of identifying ciliary signaling pathways disrupted in these disorders and the ultimate aim of finding novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) control synaptic plasticity and brain development in a manner determined by receptor subunit composition. Pathogenic variants in <I>GRIN2A</I> gene, encoding the NMDAR GluN2A subunit, can cause gain or loss of function of receptors containing the affected subunit and are associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in patients. While in vitro studies of recombinant receptors have yielded some insights, animal experimental models are essential to better understand the relationship between the molecular pathology of the variants and the disease. Here we introduce a zebrafish model of GluN2A loss of function to study system-level effects of zebrafish <I>grin2Aa</I> and <I>grin2Ab</I> gene deletion. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed functional differences between receptors containing zebrafish GluN2Aa/b and GluN2Bb paralogs comparable with mammalian receptors containing GluN2A versus GluN2B subunits. Both <I>grin2Aa<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>grin2Ab<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> as well as double-knock-out <I>grin2A<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> zebrafish larvae showed increased locomotor activity in a novel environment. Proteomic analysis suggested that the relative proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs may be increased in <I>grin2A</I> mutant fish. Our results highlight fundamental similarities between zebrafish and mammalian NMDAR signaling and validate the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the neurodevelopmental role of NMDARs. The newly created transgenic zebrafish strains complement the rodent models of GluN2A loss of function and can be used for high-throughput testing of pharmacological or genetic treatment strategies for patients with <I>GRIN2A</I> gene variants.</p>

                <p>Nitrous oxide use disorder (NUD) has recently received increasing social concern for its sharp rise among young people. However, the underlying mechanisms of NUD remain largely unexplored, which obstructs treatment strategy development and may exacerbate the epidemic of N<SUB>2</SUB>O abuse. Thus, specifying the essential mechanisms and targets in NUD are desperately needed. Here we unveiled a series of molecular adaptations regarding N<SUB>2</SUB>O reward memory in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice through multi-omics approaches comprising transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. Our miRNA transcriptomics and pull-down proteomics analyzes uncovered that miR-7220-5p regulated N<SUB>2</SUB>O-induced conditioned-place preference (CPP) and associated increase of dendritic spine density in NAc of male mice. Our pull-down proteomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that miR-7220-5p modulated ERK signaling pathway by directly binding with NR2B receptor. In summary, our work confirmed that restoring miR-7220-5p expression in NAc protected against synaptic abnormality via the NR2B/ERK/CREB signaling, thereby attenuating CPP behaviors in NUD. Selective inhibition of NR2B or ERK signaling blocked the reward memory of N<SUB>2</SUB>O-CPP via NAc microinjection. Our study proposed a potential therapeutic strategy for NUD and provided comprehensive resources of biological data to support future investigations of NUD treatment.</p>

                <p>The dynamics of social dominance play a significant role in regulating access to resources and influencing reproductive success and survival in nonhuman primates. These dynamics are based on aggressive and submissive interactions that create distinct, hierarchically organized social structures. In humans, whose social behavior is similarly organized, the use of brain imaging based on tractography has identified key neuronal networks of the limbic system underlying social behavior. Among them, the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum bundle have been associated with aggression and some disorders such as psychopathy. In this study, we have used advanced tractography to study the anatomy of connections underlying social dominance in a colony of 15 female squirrel monkeys (<I>Saimiri sciureus</I>). We correlated the biostructural properties of the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum with behavioral hierarchy measures while controlling for factors such as age, weight, handedness, brain size, and hormonal influences. The fornix, a limbic connection involved in memory, was also included as the control tract. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between the integrity of the right uncinate fasciculus and social dominance measures, including normalized David's scores, aggressive behaviors, and submissive behaviors. Trends observed in the left uncinate fasciculus hint at potential bilateral involvement with a right hemispheric lateralization. These results are consistent with human studies linking the uncinate fasciculus to social aggression and disorders, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in the neuroanatomical substrates of social dominance back to at least 35 million years.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to long-lasting cognitive deficits in the human brain, with a considerable contribution of secondary morphological and functional sequela in cortical regions distant to the lesion site. In order to uncover the role of early functional alterations in parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV-BCs), an interneuron population required to maintain inhibition of neocortical circuits, to this dysfunctional plasticity, we investigated anatomical and electrophysiological properties of PV-BCs in PV-IRES-Cre-tdTomato mice of both sexes 24&nbsp;h after a cortical impact. These experiments revealed that the number of PV-BCs was moderately decreased around the cortical impact site, while their morphology was unaffected. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that TBI increased the input resistance of PV-BCs and the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>). In addition, the maximal firing frequency upon depolarizing stimuli was decreased. The increase in <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> amplitude was paralleled by the appearance of somatic HCN channels in immunohistochemical staining and the occurrence of somatic <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> in nucleated patch recordings, suggesting that TBI induced a redistribution of HCN channels from a purely axonal to an additional somatodendritic expression. Pharmacological experiments showed that inhibition of axonal HCN-mediated currents impairs the maximal firing frequency of PV-BCs. Additional in silico simulations disclosed the general importance of axonal HCN channels to maintain high-frequency firing of PV-BCs by counteracting Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-pump associated hyperpolarizing currents. In summary, our results suggest that the early loss of PV-BCs and the TBI-induced distinct alterations in their electrophysiological properties can contribute to the establishment of disturbed network activity following TBI.</p>

                <p>by Dimitrios Chalkiadakis, Jaime Sánchez-Claros, Víctor J. López-Madrona, Santiago Canals, Claudio R. Mirasso</p>

Interactions among brain rhythms play a crucial role in organizing neuronal firing sequences during specific cognitive functions. In memory formation, the coupling between the phase of the theta rhythm and the amplitude of gamma oscillations has been extensively studied in the hippocampus. Prevailing perspectives suggest that the phase of the slower oscillation modulates the fast activity. However, recent metrics, such as Cross-Frequency Directionality (CFD), indicate that these electrophysiological interactions can be bidirectional. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition modeled by a theta-modulated ING (Interneuron Network Gamma) mechanism induces fast-to-slow interactions, while feedback inhibition through a theta-modulated PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) model drives slow-to-fast interactions. Importantly, in circuits combining both feedforward and feedback motifs, as commonly found experimentally, directionality is flexibly modulated by synaptic strength within biologically realistic ranges. A signature of this interaction is that fast-to-slow dominance in feedforward motifs is associated with gamma oscillations of higher frequency, and <i>vice versa</i>. Using previously acquired electrophysiological data from the hippocampus of rats freely navigating in a familiar environment or in a novel one, we show that CFD is dynamically regulated and linked to the frequency of the gamma band, as predicted by the model. Finally, the model attributes each theta-gamma interaction scheme, determined by the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibition, to distinct modes of information transmission and integration, adding computational flexibility. Our results offer a plausible neurobiological interpretation for cross-frequency directionality measurements associated with the activation of different underlying motifs that serve distinct computational needs.

                <p>by R. Tucker Gilman, CD Durrant, Lucy Malpas, Rebecca N. Lewis</p>

In human languages, words that are used more frequently tend to be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This pattern is known as Zipf’s law of abbreviation. It has been attributed to the principle of least effort – communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipf’s law of abbreviation appears to hold in all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds in animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are used less frequently. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this method. We used ZLAvian to study Zipf’s law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found evidence for Zipf’s law in a synthetic analysis across all populations. Overall, the negative concordance between phrase length and frequency of use in birdsong was several times weaker than the negative concordance between word length and frequency of use in written human languages. The method and the results we present here offer a new foundation for researchers studying if or how the principle of least effort shapes animal communication.

                <p>by N. Ezgi Wood, Anıl Cengiz, Ming Gao, Alexander V. Ratushny, Ronny Straube</p>

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are gaining increasing traction in the treatment of oncological diseases; however, many clinical failures have also been observed. One key factor limiting ADC effectiveness is the heterogeneous expression of their target antigen. While the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development target antigens on cancer cells (cancer-targeting), they can also target antigens expressed on non-cancerous stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (stroma-targeting). It remains unclear if ADCs targeting stromal cells can outperform cancer-targeting ADCs. Here, we present three related mathematical models to evaluate: (1) cancer-targeting ADCs with homogeneous target antigen expression, (2) cancer-targeting ADCs with heterogeneous target antigen expression, and (3) stroma-targeting ADCs. Our simulations suggest that cancer-targeting ADCs can achieve high efficacy when their target antigen is homogenously expressed. However, in cases of heterogeneous antigen expression, cancer-targeting ADCs may lead to an initial reduction in tumor size, followed by regrowth due to the elimination of antigen-positive cells and expansion of antigen-negative cells. This limitation could potentially be overcome by stroma-targeting ADCs, as antigen-positive stromal cells may continue to be recruited into the tumor by the oncogenic factors produced by the remaining cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ADCs with more permeable payloads and less stable linkers may offer improved efficacy in the context of heterogeneous target expression.

                <p>by Christine A. Wang, William J. Love, Manuel Jara, Arnoud H. M. van Vliet, Siddhartha Thakur, Cristina Lanzas</p>

<i>Campylobacter spp.</i> resistant to fluoroquinolones and macrolides are serious public health threats. Studies aiming to identify risk factors for drug-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> have narrowly focused on antimicrobial use at the farm level. Using chain graphs, we quantified risk factors for fluoroquinolones- and macrolide-resistance in <i>Campylobacter coli</i> isolated from two distinctive swine production systems, conventional and antibiotic-free (ABF). The chain graphs were learned using genotypic and antimicrobial susceptibility data from 1082 isolates and host exposures obtained through surveys for 14 cohorts of pigs. The gyrA T86I point mutation alone explained at least 58% of the variance in ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ABF and 79% in conventional farms. For macrolides, genotype and host exposures explained similar variance in azithromycin and erythromycin MIC. Among host exposures, heavy metal exposures were identified as risk factors in both conventional and ABF. Chain graph models can generate insights into the complex epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance by characterizing context-specific risk factors and facilitating causal discovery.

                <p>by Daniel Sobrido-Cameán, Bramwell Coulson, Michael Miller, Matthew C. W. Oswald, Tom Pettini, David M. D. Bailey, Richard A. Baines, Matthias Landgraf</p>

As developing networks transition from spontaneous irregular to patterned activity, they undergo plastic tuning phases, termed “critical periods”; “critical” because disturbances during these phases can lead to lasting changes in network development and output. Critical periods are common to developing nervous systems, with analogous features shared from insects to mammals, yet the core signaling mechanisms that underlie cellular critical period plasticity have remained elusive. To identify these, we exploited the <i>Drosophila</i> larval locomotor network as an advantageous model system. It has a defined critical period and offers unparalleled access to identified network elements, including the neuromuscular junction as a model synapse. We find that manipulations of a single motoneuron or muscle cell during the critical period lead to predictable, and permanent, cell-specific changes. This demonstrates that critical period adjustments occur at a single-cell level. Mechanistically, we identified mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) as causative. Specifically, we show that ROS produced by Complex-I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, generated by the reverse flow of electrons, is necessary and instructive for critical period-regulated plasticity. Downstream of ROS, we identified the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), as required for transducing the mitochondrial ROS signal to the nucleus. This signaling axis is also sufficient to cell autonomously specify changes in neuronal properties and animal behavior but, again, only when activated during the embryonic critical period. Thus, we have identified specific mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1α as primary signals that mediate critical period plasticity.

<p>ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders of social behavior deficits and repetitive / restricted behaviors, affecting 1 in 31 children in the U.S. Pharmacological interventions for the core symptoms of ASD are lacking. ASD genetics are highly heterogenous, with hundreds of genes conferring risk, though these genes are beginning to converge on shared molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms, representing potential new paths for treatment development.

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviors. ASDs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous with hundreds of genes identified through large-scale whole exome and genome sequencing studies contributing to risk. Recent studies are beginning to illuminate shared mechanisms across ASD-associated genes at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and behavioral levels, identifying neurogenesis and excitatory-inhibitory neuron development as points of biological convergence. These functional analyses of ASD genes provide substantial promise for gaining a deeper understanding of ASD pathophysiology and elucidating novel therapeutic targets.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) as an adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) remain uncertain, with recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yielding conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of IAT following successful EVT in patients with LVOS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, the Cochrane Library databases, and the International Stroke Conference 2025 abstracts to identify RCTs evaluating IAT following successful EVT from January 2015 to February 2025. The primary outcome was the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–1 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS = 0–2). Safety measures included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality at 90 days. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250651602).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The primary pooled analysis of 6 RCTs (<i>N</i> = 1,974) showed that IAT significantly increased the likelihood of achieving excellent functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–1: odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–1.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with a notable effect in anterior circulation (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not in posterior circulation LVOS (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.83–2.74, <i>p</i> = 0.18). Among thrombolytic drugs, alteplase was most strongly associated with favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–1: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.31–2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), followed by tenecteplase (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.08–1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.01). No significant safety concerns were observed, as there was no increase in the odds of sICH (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.75–1.75, <i>p</i> = 0.51) or 90-day mortality (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79–1.26, <i>p</i> = 0.99). Sensitivity analyses for all outcomes yielded consistent results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IAT following successful EVT significantly enhances the likelihood of achieving an excellent functional outcome, particularly in anterior circulation strokes. Although the benefit in posterior circulation strokes remains uncertain, the lack of significant differences in sICH risk and mortality across thrombolytic drugs and stroke locations support the safety of IAT.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Synaptic spine loss is an early pathophysiologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) that precedes overt loss of dendritic architecture and frank neurodegeneration. While spine loss signifies a decreased engagement of postsynaptic neurons by presynaptic targets, the degree to which loss of spines and their passive components impacts the excitability of postsynaptic neurons and responses to surviving synaptic inputs is unclear. Using passive multicompartmental models of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), implicated in early AD, we find that spine loss alone drives a boosting of remaining inputs to their proximal and distal dendrites, targeted by CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC), respectively. This boosting effect is higher in distal versus proximal dendrites and can be mediated by spine loss restricted to the distal compartment, enough to impact synaptic input integration, somatodendritic backpropagation, and plateau potential generation. This has particular relevance to very early stages of AD in which pathophysiology extends from EC to CA1.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize insular seizure semiology and correlate with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure onset in a well-defined cohort, in particular examining differences between anterior and posterior insular seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We documented all semiological signs and the timing of emergence for 45 patients with SEEG-confirmed insular epilepsy, along with the precise location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the insula. Semiological signs and other non-invasive data were compared between those with anterior and posterior insula SOZ, with more detailed insular subregion description when appropriate. Co-occurrence patterns of insular semiological signs were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 87% reported auras and the corresponding insular SOZ demonstrated an anterior-to-posterior gradient by aura type. The absence of aura was significantly associated with an anterior insula SOZ (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Late grunting/moaning (<i>p</i> = 0.07), symmetric mouth elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1), blinking (<i>p</i> = 0.05), and chewing/repetitive swallowing (<i>p</i> = 0.09) also suggested an anterior insula SOZ. Unilateral non-painful somatosensory aura (<i>p</i> = 0.07) and early arm/hand elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1) suggested a posterior insular SOZ.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report the characteristics and semiological features in a large cohort of primary insular epilepsy patients. The type of aura is crucial for identifying the SOZ and the timing of semiological emergence contributes to the anatomo-electro-clinical localization of an insular SOZ. These findings can enhance identification of insular epilepsy, making targeted curative treatment feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The retention and use of long-term memories is crucial for adaptive behavior. While stable memories help organisms anticipate outcomes, they may become maladaptive if not updated to reflect new conditions as the environment changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that forgetting reflects altered activation of engram cells, with memories persisting in a latent state rather than being erased. One explanation for the forgetting of particular memories is active competition between memory engrams for expression in the brain. Behavioral studies reveal that various forms of forgetting stem from this competition. Here we synthesize behavioral research through the lens of engram competition, focusing on its biological substrates and driving factors. We propose a framework to better understand diverse forms of natural forgetting as well as associated pathological conditions.

                Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods can modulate brain plasticity, the fundamental process by which synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened in response to synaptic activity or external stimuli. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding how NIBS techniques induce long-lasting synaptic changes resembling long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We place special emphasis on metaplasticity, the process by which prior neural activity influences subsequent plasticity responses. We highlight how various stimulation parameters, brain state, and individual differences shape plasticity outcomes, and emphasize the challenges in achieving consistent therapeutic effects. Additionally, we discuss the potential clinical impact of applying metaplasticity concepts in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We outline critical areas for future research and emphasize the importance of developing personalized NIBS protocols that are closely aligned with underlying biological mechanisms to improve therapeutic outcomes.

                Chadwick et al. report that intermittent fasting sensitizes leptin signaling in sensory neurons supporting regeneration. This contrasts with a high-fat diet that induces leptin resistance and neuropathy. Leptin promotes regeneration after a spinal cord and sciatic nerve injury via an endocrine or autocrine mechanism by enhancing cAMP and transcription.

                Fei et al. observe enriched motion selectivity in colliculogeniculate boutons in the mouse primary visual thalamus. These collicular boutons often share visual preferences with nearby retinal boutons. Silencing collicular input suppresses visual responses and reduces motion selectivity in thalamic neurons, indicating the significant roles of non-retinal input in shaping thalamic visual representation.
