              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological indices of individual differences in adult language learning</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in second language (L2) learning can offer insights into the neurobiological bases of learning aptitude. One neurophysiological marker of inter-individual differences in cognition is the individual alpha frequency (IAF), a trait-like measure correlated with cognition. Further, the N400 is an electrophysiological marker indexing stimulus irregularity and has been used to study L2 learning; however, its relationship with IAF and L2 learning remains unknown. To examine the relation between IAF and L2 learning (indexed by N400 amplitude), we report data from a modified miniature language learning study. After a vocabulary learning period, participants (N = 38, Mage = 25.3, SD = 7.13) judged the grammaticality of classifier-noun pairs, with mixed-effects modelling revealing lower IAF individuals were better than higher IAF individuals at grammaticality judgements. N400 amplitude also reduced across the experiment in low relative to high IAF individuals, indicating the relationship between IAF and language learning is more complex than initially postulated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Revealing human sensitivity to a latent temporal structure of changes</a></h4>

              
                Precisely timed behaviour and accurate time perception plays a critical role in our everyday lives, as our well-being and even survival can depend on well-timed decisions. Although the temporal structure of the world around us is essential for human decision making, we know surprisingly little about how representation of temporal structure of our everyday environment impacts decision making. How does the representation of temporal structure affect our ability to generate well-timed decisions? Here we address this question by using a well-established dynamic probabilistic learning task. Using computational modelling, we found that human subjects' beliefs about temporal structure are reflected in their choices to either exploit their current knowledge or to explore novel options. The model-based analysis illustrates a large within-group and within-subject heterogeneity. To explain these results, we propose a normative model for how temporal structure is used in decision making, based on the semi-Markov formalism in an active inference framework. We discuss potential key applications of the presented approach to the fields of cognitive phenotyping and computational psychiatry.

	<p>Background: Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine improves neurological function. Whether dexmedetomidine reduces mortality or improves quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) among patients post-craniotomy remains unclear. Methods: This single-center randomized study was conducted prospectively from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Patients who were transferred to the ICU after craniotomy within 24 h were included. The analgesic was titrated to a Critical care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) score &amp;amp;le;2, and the sedative was titrated to a Richmond Agitation&amp;amp;ndash;Sedation Scale (RASS) score &amp;amp;le;&amp;amp;minus;3 for at least 24 h. The qEEG signals were collected by four electrodes (F3, T3, F4, and T4 according to the international 10/20 EEG electrode practice). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and qEEG results on day 1 and day 3 after sedation. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 77 were in the dexmedetomidine group and 74 in the midazolam group. No significant difference was found between the two groups in mortality at 28 days (14.3% vs. 24.3%; p = 0.117) as well as in the theta/beta ratio (TBR), the delta/alpha ratio (DAR), and the (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (DTABR) between the two groups on day 1 or day 3. However, both the TBR and the DTABR were significantly increased in the dexmedetomidine group. The DTABR in the midazolam group was significantly increased. The DAR was significantly increased on the right side in the dexmedetomidine group (20.4 (11.6&amp;amp;ndash;43.3) vs. 35.1 (16.7&amp;amp;ndash;65.0), p = 0.006) as well as on both sides in the midazolam group (Left: 19.5 (10.1&amp;amp;ndash;35.8) vs. 37.3 (19.3&amp;amp;ndash;75.7), p = 0.006; Right: 18.9 (10.1&amp;amp;ndash;52.3) vs. 39.8 (17.5&amp;amp;ndash;99.9), p = 0.002). Conclusion: Compared with midazolam, dexmedetomidine did not lead to a lower 28-day mortality or better qEEG results in brain injury patients after a craniotomy.</p>

	<p>Background: Multi-modal neuroimaging with appropriate atlas is vital for effectively differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls (HC). Methods: The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) of 69 MCI patients and 61 HC subjects were collected. Then, the gray matter volumes obtained from the sMRI and Hurst exponent (HE) values calculated from rs-fMRI data in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL-90), Brainnetome (BN-246), Harvard&amp;amp;ndash;Oxford (HOA-112) and AAL3-170 atlases were extracted, respectively. Next, these characteristics were selected with a minimal redundancy maximal relevance algorithm and a sequential feature collection method in single or multi-modalities, and only the optimal features were retained after this procedure. Lastly, the retained characteristics were served as the input features for the support vector machine (SVM)-based method to classify MCI patients, and the performance was estimated with a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results: Our proposed method obtained the best 92.00% accuracy, 94.92% specificity and 89.39% sensitivity with the sMRI in AAL-90 and the fMRI in HOA-112 atlas, which was much better than using the single-modal or single-atlas features. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the multi-modal and multi-atlas integrated method could effectively recognize MCI patients, which could be extended into various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘Comparison and correlation of the maxillary sinus dimensions in various craniofacial patterns: A CBCT Study’ [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To compare and correlate the maxillary sinus dimensions and basal bone height among various facial patterns using CBCT for advanced diagnosis and treatment planning in Orthodontics. Methods: 66 CBCT images within age group of 18-30 years were divided into horizontal (Group 1), average (Group 2) and vertical (Group 3) facial growth patterns. Maxillary sinus dimensions were compared and correlated in all three groups. The sinus height and basal bone height were recorded at 3 locations-between 1st premolar and 2nd premolar (PM1-PM2), between 2nd premolar and 1st Molar (PM2-M1) and between 1st and 2nd molar (M1-M2). Results: Overall reduction in sinus height and significantly reduced sinus volume was seen in Group-1. Longest maxillary sinus height in M1-M2 region and shortest in PM1-PM2 region was seen in Group-3. The basal bone height in PM1-PM2 region was significantly longer in Group-3 than in Group-1(p<.05).Shortest basal bone height in M1-M2 region was seen in Group-3. A significant negative correlation was seen between the maxillary sinus height and the basal bone height in Group-1 and Group-3(p<.05). Conclusion: There is a correlation between the maxillary sinus height and basal bone height with that of facial pattern which needs to be considered during orthodontic treatment planning and while carrying out facial growth modification procedures in younger patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Closing the communication gap in neonatal inter-hospital transfer: a neonatal referral form for resource-limited settings - a modified e-Delphi-consensus study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Standardised neonatal referral forms (NRFs) facilitate effective communication between healthcare providers and ensure continuity of care between facilities, which are essential for patient safety. We sought to determine the essential data items, or core clinical information (CCI), that should be conveyed for neonatal inter-hospital transfer in resource-limited settings (Rounds 1 to 3) and to create an NRF suitable for our setting (Round 4). Methods: We conducted an international, four-round, modified Delphi-consensus study. Round-1 was a literature and internet search to identify existing NRFs. In Round-2 and -3, participants were Rwandan clinicians and international paediatric healthcare practitioners who had worked in Rwanda in the five years before the study. These participants evaluated the draft items and proposed additional items to be included in an NRF. Round-4 focused on creating the NRF and used five focus groups of Rwandan general practitioners at district hospitals. Results: We identified 16 pre-existing NRFs containing 125 individual items. Of these, 91 items met the pre-defined consensus criteria for inclusion in Round-2. Only 33 items were present in more than 50% of the 16 NRFs, confirming the need for this consensus study. In Round-2, participants proposed 12 new items, six of which met the pre-defined consensus criteria. In Round-3, participants scored items for importance, and 57 items met the final consensus criteria. In Round-4, 29 general practitioners took part in five focus groups; a total of 16 modifications were utilised to finalise the NRF. Conclusions: We generated a novel, robust, NRF that may be readily employed in resource-limited settings to communicate the essential clinical information to accompany a neonate requiring inter-hospital transfer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Impact of Green Practices in Value Chain on Firm Performance in the Context of a Developing Country [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Companies need to go green to remain relevant. Previous studies have confirmed that going green leads to superior performance for companies. However, research of green practices in a value chain requires further attention, especially in identifying the green value chain activities that lead to superior performance. A value chain analysis focuses on identifying competitive advantages of firms through five primary and four support activities. Methods: This study extends from Ong et al. (2019), who developed and validated the instrument for the nine green value chain activities, to also examine their effect on firm performance. The 207 valid responses in this study are collected through a questionnaire survey of the sampling frame consisting of companies in Bursa Malaysia and the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Directory. Results: The findings reveal that the companies’ green practices in primary value chain activities are higher than in the supporting value chain activities. Technological development is the activity with the lowest green attention among the nine value chain activities. Our multiple regression analysis shows that 25% of the variation in firm performance can be significantly explained by the nine green value chain activities. In terms of the individual green value chain activities, green technology development is the only activity that can positively and significantly explain firm performance. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that companies intending to build their green core competence need to engage in green technology development. Companies that go green for the purpose of complying to regulations and fulfilling minimum customers’ demands can still embed green practices into their green value chain without compromising their performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Whole community invasions and the integration of novel ecosystems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Colin Campbell, Laura Russo, Réka Albert, Angus Buckling, Katriona Shea</p>

The impact of invasion by a single non-native species on the function and structure of ecological communities can be significant, and the effects can become more drastic–and harder to predict–when multiple species invade as a group. Here we modify a dynamic Boolean model of plant-pollinator community assembly to consider the invasion of native communities by multiple invasive species that are selected either randomly or such that the invaders constitute a stable community. We show that, compared to random invasion, whole community invasion leads to final stable communities (where the initial process of species turnover has given way to a static or near-static set of species in the community) including both native and non-native species that are larger, more likely to retain native species, and which experience smaller changes to the topological measures of nestedness and connectance. We consider the relationship between the prevalence of mutualistic interactions among native and invasive species in the final stable communities and demonstrate that mutualistic interactions may act as a buffer against significant disruptions to the native community.

Background <p>Transcription factor (TF) regulates the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA by binding to upstream sequence motifs. Identifying the locations of known motifs in whole genomes is computationally intensive.</p> Methodology/Principal findings <p>This study presents a computational tool, named “Grit”, for screening TF-binding sites (TFBS) by coordinating transcription factors to their promoter sequences in orthologous genes. This tool employs a newly developed mixed Student’s <i>t</i>-test statistical method that detects high-scoring binding sites utilizing conservation information among species. The program performs sequence scanning at a rate of 3.2 Mbp/s on a quad-core Amazon server and has been benchmarked by the well-established ChIP-Seq datasets, putting Grit amongst the top-ranked TFBS predictors. It significantly outperforms the well-known transcription factor motif scanning tools, Pscan (4.8%) and FIMO (17.8%), in analyzing well-documented ChIP-Atlas human genome Chip-Seq datasets.</p> Significance <p>Grit is a good alternative to current available motif scanning tools.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The aesthetic value of reef fishes is globally mismatched to their conservation priorities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juliette Langlois, François Guilhaumon, Florian Baletaud, Nicolas Casajus, Cédric De Almeida Braga, Valentine Fleuré, Michel Kulbicki, Nicolas Loiseau, David Mouillot, Julien P. Renoult, Aliénor Stahl, Rick D. Stuart Smith, Anne-Sophie Tribot, Nicolas Mouquet</p>

Reef fishes are closely connected to many human populations, yet their contributions to society are mostly considered through their economic and ecological values. Cultural and intrinsic values of reef fishes to the public can be critical drivers of conservation investment and success, but remain challenging to quantify. Aesthetic value represents one of the most immediate and direct means by which human societies engage with biodiversity, and can be evaluated from species to ecosystems. Here, we provide the aesthetic value of 2,417 ray-finned reef fish species by combining intensive evaluation of photographs of fishes by humans with predicted values from machine learning. We identified important biases in species’ aesthetic value relating to evolutionary history, ecological traits, and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threat status. The most beautiful fishes are tightly packed into small parts of both the phylogenetic tree and the ecological trait space. In contrast, the less attractive fishes are the most ecologically and evolutionary distinct species and those recognized as threatened. Our study highlights likely important mismatches between potential public support for conservation and the species most in need of this support. It also provides a pathway for scaling-up our understanding of what are both an important nonmaterial facet of biodiversity and a key component of nature’s contribution to people, which could help better anticipate consequences of species loss and assist in developing appropriate communication strategies.

                <p>Autosomal-dominant, Dutch-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D-CAA) offers a unique opportunity to develop biomarkers for pre-symptomatic CAA. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures of white matter injury would be present and progressive in D-CAA prior to hemorrhagic lesions or symptomatic hemorrhage. In a longitudinal cohort of D-CAA carriers and non-carriers, we observed divergence of white matter injury measures between D-CAA carriers and non-carriers prior to the appearance of cerebral microbleeds and &gt;14 years before the average age of first symptomatic hemorrhage. These results indicate that white matter disruption measures may be valuable cross-sectional and longitudinal biomarkers of D-CAA progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differences in the length of postoperative care of endoscopic endonasal surgery in simple and complex surgical procedure groups [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid development of endoscopic endonasal surgery has made the procedure widely used in nasal and sinus surgery. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, but the possibility of postoperative damage to the sinonasal mucosa cannot be ruled out. The aim of this study was to analyze the difference in the length of postoperative care between complex and simple endoscopic endonasal surgeries which can be used as a reference in planning postoperative care.   Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study. The participants were divided into two groups, i.e., simple, and complex surgical procedures groups. The simple procedure group consisted of middle meatal anstrostomy, uncinectomy, endoscopic septoplasty, and endoscopic turbinoplasty. The complex procedure group included frontal sinusotomy, sphenoidectomy, as well as anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy. The length of postoperative care between the two groups were measured and analyzed using the Chi-square test.   Results: The median length of care in the complex procedure group was significantly longer than that in the simple procedure group (p = 0.028), 12 weeks and 9 weeks, respectively. The number of postoperative outpatient visits was significantly less in the simple procedure group compared with the complex procedure group (Median 4 vs. 5; p=0.015). There was a significant correlation between length of care and the endonasal endoscopic surgical procedure group (p = 0.023).   Conclusions: The complex endoscopic endonasal surgery group required a longer length of care and more postoperative outpatient visit than the simple procedure group.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast bacterial growth reduces antibiotic accumulation and efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Phenotypic variations between individual microbial cells play a key role in the resistance of microbial pathogens to pharmacotherapies. Nevertheless, little is known about cell individuality in antibiotic accumulation. Here, we hypothesise that phenotypic diversification can be driven by fundamental cell-to-cell differences in drug transport rates. To test this hypothesis, we employed microfluidics-based single-cell microscopy, libraries of fluorescent antibiotic probes and mathematical modelling. This approach allowed us to rapidly identify phenotypic variants that avoid antibiotic accumulation within populations of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Crucially, we found that fast growing phenotypic variants avoid macrolide accumulation and survive treatment without genetic mutations. These findings are in contrast with the current consensus that cellular dormancy and slow metabolism underlie bacterial survival to antibiotics. Our results also show that fast growing variants display significantly higher expression of ribosomal promoters before drug treatment compared to slow growing variants. Drug-free active ribosomes facilitate essential cellular processes in these fast-growing variants, including efflux that can reduce macrolide accumulation. We used this new knowledge to eradicate variants that displayed low antibiotic accumulation through the chemical manipulation of their outer membrane inspiring new avenues to overcome current antibiotic treatment failures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional coupling between TRPV4 channel and TMEM16F modulates human trophoblast fusion</a></h4>

              
                TMEM16F, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase), is critical for placental trophoblast syncytialization, HIV infection, and SARS-CoV2-mediated syncytialization, however, how TMEM16F is activated during cell fusion is unclear. Here, using trophoblasts as a model for cell fusion, we demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid channel TRPV4 is critical for TMEM16F activation and plays a role in subsequent human trophoblast fusion. GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 specific agonist, robustly activates TMEM16F in trophoblasts. We also show that TRPV4 and TMEM16F are functionally coupled within Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains in a human trophoblast cell line using patch clamp electrophysiology. Pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of TRPV4 hinders TMEM16F activation and subsequent trophoblast syncytialization. Our study uncovers the functional expression of TRPV4 and one of the physiological activation mechanisms of TMEM16F in human trophoblasts, thus providing us with novel strategies to regulate CaPLSase activity as a critical checkpoint of physiologically- and disease-relevant cell fusion events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells driven by T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling predominantly infiltrate Trypanosoma cruzi-infected hearts</a></h4>

              
                Increasing attention has been directed to cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4CTLs) in different pathologies, both in humans and mice. The impact of CD4CTLs in immunity and the mechanisms controlling their generation, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we show that CD4CTLs abundantly differentiate during mouse infection with the intracellular parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>. CD4CTLs display parallel kinetics to Th1 cells in the spleen, mediate specific cytotoxicity against cells presenting pathogen-derived antigens and express immunoregulatory and/or exhaustion markers. We demonstrate that CD4CTL absolute numbers and activity are severely reduced in both <i>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Il18ra<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Of note, the infection of mixed-bone marrow chimeras revealed that WT but not <i>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells transcribe the CD4CTL gene signature and that <i>Il18ra<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup></i> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells phenocopy each other. Moreover, adoptive transfer of WT CD4<sup>+</sup>GzB<sup>+</sup> T cells to infected <i>Il18ra<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice extended their survival. Importantly, cells expressing the CD4CTL phenotype predominate among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating the infected mouse cardiac tissue and are increased in the blood of Chagas patients, in which the frequency of CD4CTLs correlates with the severity of cardiomyopathy. Our findings describe CD4CTLs as a major player in immunity to a relevant human pathogen and disclose T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling as a key pathway controlling the magnitude of the CD4CTL response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The control and training of single motor units in isometric tasks are constrained by a common input signal</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in neural interfaces enable the real-time and non-invasive tracking of motor neuron spiking activity. Such novel interfaces could provide a promising basis for human motor augmentation by extracting potentially high-dimensional control signals directly from the human nervous system. However, it is unclear how flexibly humans can control the activity of individual motor neurons to effectively increase the number of degrees-of-freedom available to coordinate multiple effectors simultaneously. Here, we provided human subjects (N=7) with real-time feedback on the discharge patterns of pairs of motor units (MUs) innervating a single muscle (tibialis anterior) and encouraged them to independently control the MUs by tracking targets in a 2D space. Subjects learned control strategies to achieve the target-tracking task for various combinations of MUs. These strategies rarely corresponded to a volitional control of independent input signals to individual MUs during the onset of neural activity. Conversely, MU activation was consistent with a common input to the MU pair, while individual activation of the MUs in the pair was predominantly achieved by alterations in de-recruitment order that could be explained with history-dependent changes in motor neuron excitability. These results suggest that flexible MU recruitment based on independent synaptic inputs to single MUs is unlikely, although de-recruitment might reflect varying inputs or modulations in the neuron's intrinsic excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tonic inhibition of the chloride/proton antiporter ClC-7 by PI(3,5)P2 is crucial for lysosomal pH maintenance</a></h4>

              
                The acidic luminal pH of lysosomes, maintained within a narrow range, is essential for proper degrative function of the organelle and is generated by the action of a V-type H<sup>+</sup> ATPase, but other pathways for ion movement are required to dissipate the voltage generated by this process. ClC-7, a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter responsible for lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability, is a candidate to contribute to the acidification process as part of this 'counterion pathway'. The signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2 modulates lysosomal dynamics, including by regulating lysosomal ion channels, raising the possibility that it could contribute to lysosomal pH regulation. Here we demonstrate that depleting PI(3,5)P2 by inhibiting the PIKfyve kinase causes lysosomal hyperacidification, primarily via an effect on ClC-7. We further show that PI(3,5)P2 directly inhibits ClC-7 transport and that this inhibition is eliminated in a disease-causing gain-of-function ClC-7 mutation. Together these observations suggest an intimate role for ClC-7 in lysosomal pH regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A mechanism with severing near barbed ends andannealing explains structure and dynamics of dendriticactin networks</a></h4>

              
                Single molecule imaging has shown that part of actin disassembles within a few seconds after incorporation into the dendritic filament network in lamellipodia, suggestive of frequent destabilization near barbed ends. To investigate the mechanisms behind network remodeling, we created a stochastic model with polymerization, depolymerization, branching, capping, uncapping, severing, oligomer diffusion, annealing, and debranching. We find that filament severing, enhanced near barbed ends, can explain the single molecule actin lifetime distribution, if oligomer fragments reanneal to free ends with rate constants comparable to in vitro measurements. The same mechanism leads to actin networks consistent with measured filament, end, and branch concentrations. These networks undergo structural remodeling, leading to longer filaments away from the leading edge, at the +/- 35&#x1D45C; orientation pattern. Imaging of actin speckle lifetimes at sub-second resolution verifies frequent disassembly of newly-assembled actin. We thus propose a unified mechanism that fits a diverse set of basic lamellipodia phenomenology.

                We report the real-time response of E. coli to lactoferricin-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) on length-scales bridging microscopic cell-sizes to nanoscopic lipid packing using millisecond time-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering. Coupling a multi-scale scattering data analysis to biophysical assays for peptide partitioning revealed that the AMPs rapidly permeabilize the cytosolic membrane within less than three seconds-much faster than previously considered. Final intracellular AMP concentrations of ~ 80 to 100 mM suggest an efficient obstruction of physiologically important processes as primary cause for bacterial killing. On the other hand, damage of the cell envelope and leakage occurred also at sublethal peptide concentrations, thus emerging as a collateral effect of AMP activity that does not kill the bacteria. This implies that the impairment of the membrane barrier is a necessary but not sufficient condition for microbial killing by lactoferricins. The most efficient AMP studied exceeds others in both speed of permeabilizing membranes and lowest intracellular peptide concentration needed to inhibit bacterial growth.

                Visual perception in adult humans is thought to be optimised to represent the statistical regularities of natural scenes (e.g. Parraga et al., 2000; Simoncelli, 2003). In infancy and early childhood, visual input is required to drive visual development (Berardi et al., 2000; Blakemore & Cooper, 1970; Jand&oacute et al., 2012; Knudsen, 2004), but whether or not scene statistics are extracted and represented colour is currently unknown. In adults, visual sensitivity to different hues shows an asymmetry, which relates to the statistical regularity of colour in the natural world (Bosten et al., 2015). We measured colour discrimination in infants to investigate whether or not the visual system can in very early life represent scene statistics. Our results reveal the earliest association between vision and natural scene statistics that has yet been found: even as young as four months of age, colour vision is aligned with the distributions of colours in natural scenes.

                Ifit2, an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2, plays a critical role in restricting neurotropic murine {beta}-coronavirus RSA59 infection. RSA59 intracranial injection of Ifit2 deficient (-/-) compared to wild type (WT) mice results in impaired acute microglial activation, associated with reduced CX3CR1 expression, which consecutively limits migration of peripheral lymphocytes into the brain, leading to impaired virus control followed by severe morbidity and mortality. While the protective role of Ifit2 is established for acute viral encephalitis, less is known about its influence on demyelination during the chronic phase of RSA59 infection. Our current study demonstrates that Ifit2 deficiency causes extensive RSA59 viral spread throughout both the spinal cord grey and white matter and is associated with impaired CD4 + T cell infiltration. Cervical lymph nodes of RSA59 infected Ifit2 -/- mice showed reduced activation of CD4 + T cells and impaired IFN{gamma} expression during acute encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, blood-brain-barrier integrity was preserved in the absence of Ifit2 as evidenced by integral, tight junction protein ZO-1 expression surrounding the meninges and blood vessels and decreased Texas red dye uptake. In contrast to WT mice exhibiting only sparse myelin loss, the chronic disease phase in Ifit2-/- mice was associated with severe demyelination and persistent viral load, even at low infection doses. Overall, our study highlights that Ifit2 provides antiviral functions by promoting acute neuroinflammation and thereby aiding virus control and limiting severe demyelination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals apoE4-dependent phosphorylation of the actin-regulating protein VASP</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers Disease (AD). While neurons generally produce a minority of the apoE in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of apoE increases dramatically in response to stress and is sufficient to drive pathology. Currently, the molecular mechanisms of how apoE4 expression may regulate pathology are not fully understood. Here we expand upon our previous studies measuring the impact of apoE4 on protein abundance to include the analysis of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling in isogenic Neuro-2a cells expressing apoE3 or apoE4. ApoE4 expression resulted in a dramatic increase in VASP S235 phosphorylation in a PKA-dependent manner. This phosphorylation disrupted VASP interactions with numerous actin cytoskeletal and microtubular proteins. Reduction of VASP S235 phosphorylation via PKA inhibition resulted in a significant increase in filopodia formation and neurite outgrowth in apoE4-expressing cells, exceeding levels observed in apoE3-expressing cells. Our results highlight the pronounced and diverse impact of apoE4 on multiple modes of protein regulation and identify potential therapeutic targets to restore apoE4-related cytoskeletal defects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generalization reveals asymmetric and history-dependent control networks for multi-finger dexterous movements</a></h4>

              
                Finger dexterity, fundamental in our daily lives, is manifested by the generation of multi-finger and multi-directional patterns of muscles activity during various motor tasks, and further, by the generalization of learning in one context to other contexts. Tying shoelaces, for example, requires precise coordination of multiple fingers, some active primarily in the flexion direction, others in the extension direction, and some immobile. Nevertheless, whether the control processes of these actions are independent or interact and potentially generalize across each other, remains unclear. In a set of experiments, we sought to characterize the behavioral principles underlying the control process, learning and generalization of dexterous extension and flexion movements. We developed an isometric dexterity task that precisely measures dexterity in terms of finger individuation, force accuracy and temporal synchronization during finger flexion and extension. First, we investigated learning and generalization abilities across flexion and extension directions, both within and across hands. To do so, two groups of participants were trained for 3 days in either the flexion or extension direction. We found improvement in all dexterity measures in both groups following training, though finger extension generally exhibited inferior dexterity. Surprisingly, while the newly acquired finger extension abilities generalized to the untrained flexion direction, the newly acquired finger flexion abilities did not generalize to the untrained extension direction. Generalization biases of the finger flexion direction were also evident in the untrained hand. Next, we examined whether the asymmetric generalization pattern of multi-finger dexterous movements was history dependent. We thus recruited skilled musicians who showed increased baseline levels of dexterity in both directions and found that the degree to which learning generalizes between two contexts was affected by prior experience. Overall, our data indicate that control of multi-digit dexterous patterns is direction-specific in humans, supporting the hypothesis that control circuits for learning of finger flexion and extension are overlapped in that they partially, but asymmetrically, transfer between directions. This ability, however, is modular as it depends on hand use and the history of prior training.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fine-scale dynamics of functional connectivity in the face processing network during movie watching</a></h4>

              
                Face are naturally dynamic, multimodal and embedded in rich social context. However, mapping the face processing network in the human brain and its relation to behavior is typically done during rest or using isolated, static face images. The use of such contrived stimuli might result in overlooking widespread cortical interactions obtained in response to naturalistic context and the temporal dynamics of these interactions. Here we examined large-scale cortical connectivity patterns measured in response to a dynamic movie in a sample of typical adults (n=517), to determine how inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC) relates to face recognition scores. We found a positive correlation with recognition scores in edges connecting the occipital visual and anterior temporal regions and a negative correlation in edges connecting attentional dorsal, frontal default, and occipital visual regions. These ISFC patterns resembled previous findings comparing individuals with congenital prosopagnosia to normal controls and the viewing of inverted compared to upright faces. To further examine these connectivity patterns, we developed a novel method that allows analysis of inter-subject stimulus-evoked node/edge responses at a single TR resolution. Using this method, we demonstrated that co-fluctuations in face-selective edges observed here and in previous work are related to local activity in core face-selective regions. Finally, correlating this temporal decomposition of the observed ISFC patterns to the movie content revealed that they peak during boundaries between movie segments rather than during the presence of faces in the movie. Our novel approach demonstrates how visual processing of faces is linked to fine-scale dynamics in attentional, memory, and perceptual neural circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sound Frequency Predicts the Bodily Location of Auditory-Induced Tactile Sensations in Synesthetic and Ordinary Perception</a></h4>

              
                For individuals who experience sound-touch synesthesia, sounds consistently evoke strong, localized sensations on the body. Interestingly, visual and auditory information can also evoke bodily sensations in ordinary perception, such as the sight or sound of a mosquito producing phantom sensations of touch. We systematically investigated the functional relationship between sound frequency and several characteristics of induced tactile experiences in synesthetes and controls. Sound frequency strongly predicted the location of tactile sensations on the body in both synesthetes and controls. Synesthetes felt sound-induced touch more frequently and in significantly more concentrated locations on their bodies compared to sound-induced touch perceptions in controls. This spatial distribution of touch reflects a behavioral mapping between tonotopy and somatotopy that suggests the involvement of early, tonotopically- and somatotopically-organized brain areas. Sound frequency also predicted the hardness, roughness, and sharpness of tactile sensations in both groups. Together, these findings highlight a strong similarity between auditory-tactile mappings in synesthetic and ordinary perception, suggesting that synesthesia only differs in the strength of the mappings and therefore is on a spectrum with ordinary perception. Furthermore, these findings offer insights into the possible underlying neural mechanisms of sound-touch mappings, suggesting that they rely on cross-modal neural pathways already in use in ordinary perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic decoupling of salience and default mode networks by optogenetic manipulation of anterior insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                The salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) are among the most widely investigated networks in the human brain. The SN, anchored in the anterior insular cortex (AI), is thought to play a critical role in stimulus-driven suppression of DMN nodes. However, the causal neural mechanisms underlying DMN suppression and SN-DMN interactions are poorly understood. Here we combine feedforward optogenetic AI stimulation with fMRI and computational modeling to dissect the causal role of AI in dynamic functional interactions between SN and DMN nodes in the rat brain. Optogenetic stimulation of Chronos-expressing AI neurons in rats suppressed DMN activity and decreased AI-DMN and intra-DMN functional connectivity. Our findings demonstrate that feedforward optogenetic stimulation of AI neurons induces dynamic suppression and decoupling of the DMN and elucidates previously unknown features of rodent brain network organization. Our study advances foundational knowledge of causal mechanisms underlying dynamic cross-network interactions and brain network switching.

	<p>Very few studies have investigated online spoken word recognition in templatic languages. In this study, we investigated both lexical (neighborhood density and frequency) and morphological (role of root morpheme) aspects of spoken word recognition of Hebrew, a templatic language, using the traditional gating paradigm. Additionally, we compared the traditional gating paradigm with a novel, phoneme-based gating paradigm. The phoneme-based approach allows for better control of information available at each gate. We found lexical effects with high-frequency words and low neighborhood density words being recognized at earlier gates. We also found that earlier access to root-morpheme information enabled word recognition at earlier gates. Finally, we showed that both the traditional gating paradigm and gating by phoneme paradigm yielded equivalent results.</p>

	<p>A major proportion of people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PwP) in Germany has written an advance directive (AD). Unfortunately, these ADs are unclear for PD-specific endpoints. We previously established consensus-based recommendations for disease-specific content of an AD in PwP. However, the implementation of those recommendations and the consulting of AD creation and modification in PwP remains to be evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the practical use of PD-specific recommendations for ADs in outpatient settings. A total of 87 physicians (45 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 neurologists, 10% response rate) answered a self-constructed semiquantitative questionnaire. The participants were asked to evaluate the suggested PD-specific recommendations for ADs and the supply of palliative care in the outpatient setting. Overall, the vast majority of treating physicians agreed on the usefulness of the newly constructed PD-specific recommendations. Consultations to discuss information about PD-specific ADs were scarce with short durations. Only 24% of participating physicians implemented the PD-specific recommendations in their daily practice. GPs and neurologists agreed on the benefit of disease-specific recommendations for ADs. In future, a more general integration of these recommendations in routine care might improve specific AD creation of PwP and advanced care planning.</p>

	<p>Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is a rare but devastating complication of advanced cancer. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma are the three most common causes of LMC, whereas it is rare in ovarian cancer. Here, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who was diagnosed with LMC from ovarian cancer and was successfully treated with intrathecal chemotherapy via Ommaya reservoir and radiation therapy. The patient had an amelioration of symptoms and prolonged survival. Though LMC from ovarian cancer is thought to be rare, it is not going to remain a rare entity because the incidence of LMC in general is thought to be increasing, which is also the case with ovarian cancer. According to 31 cases whose treatment course is reported in literature, despite the absence of an established treatment for LMC, intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy whose survival benefit has been suggested in past studies might also prolong survival in patients with LMC from ovarian cancer. IT chemotherapy via Ommaya reservoir may be preferred to the lumbar puncture route. The presentation of non-specific symptoms of LMC in patients may hinder its diagnosis; however, early diagnosis and treatment induction is the key for patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prolonged survival and restored useful life.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Patients with occlusal disharmony (OD) may be susceptible to depression. The hypothalamus&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal axis, 5-HT and 5HT2AR in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus are involved in the modulation of emotion and depression. This study investigated whether OD affects the HPA axis and 5-HT system and, subsequently, produces depression-like behaviors in rats. Materials and methods: OD was produced by removing 0.5 and 0.25 mm of hard tissue from the cusps of the maxillary molars in randomly selected sides of Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats. CUS involved exposure to 2 different stressors per day for 35 days. OD-, CUS-, and OD + CUS-treated groups and an untreated control group were compared in terms of behavior, endocrine status and brain histology. Results: There were significant differences among the four groups in the behavior tests (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), especially in the sucrose preference test, where there was a significant decrease in the OD group compared to the control group. ACTH and CORT concentrations were significantly higher in the OD + CUS group than the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Expression of GR and 5-HT2AR in the PFC, amygdala and hippocampal CA1 was significantly higher in the OD, CUS and OD + CUS groups than the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05).

	<p>Excellent response inhibition is the basis for outstanding competitive athletic performance, and sleep may be an important factor affecting athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; response inhibition. This study investigates the effect of sleep deprivation on athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; response inhibition, and its differentiating effect on non-athlete controls&amp;amp;rsquo; performance, with the aim of helping athletes effectively improve their response inhibition ability through sleep pattern manipulation. Behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data were collected from 36 participants (16 table tennis athletes and 20 general college students) after 36 h of sleep deprivation using ERP techniques and a stop-signal task. Sleep deprivation&amp;amp;rsquo;s different effects on response inhibition in the two groups were explored through repeated-measures ANOVA. Behavioral data showed that in a baseline state, stop-signal response time was significantly faster in table tennis athletes than in non-athlete controls, and appeared significantly longer after sleep deprivation in both groups. ERP results showed that at baseline state, N2, ERN, and P3 amplitudes were lower in table tennis athletes than in non-athlete controls, and corresponding significant decreases were observed in non-athlete controls after 36 h of sleep deprivation. Table tennis athletes showed a decrease in P3 amplitude and no significant difference in N2 and ERN amplitudes, after 36 h of sleep deprivation compared to the baseline state. Compared to non-athlete controls, table tennis athletes had better response inhibition, and the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on response inhibition occurred mainly in the later top-down motor inhibition process rather than in earlier automated conflict detection and monitoring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline is Reversed by D-Serine Supplementation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain aging is a natural process that involves structural and functional changes that lead to cognitive decline, even in healthy subjects. This detriment has been associated with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction because of a reduction in the brain levels of D-serine, the endogenous NMDAR co-agonist. However, it is not clear whether D-serine supplementation could be used as an intervention to reduce or reverse age-related brain alterations. In the present work, we aimed to analyze the D-serine effect on aging-associated alterations in cellular and large-scale brain systems that could support cognitive flexibility in rats. We found that D-serine supplementation reverts the age-related decline in cognitive flexibility, frontal dendritic spine density, and partially restored large-scale functional connectivity without inducing nephrotoxicity; instead, D-serine restored the thickness of the renal epithelial cells that were affected by age. Our results suggest that D-serine could be used as a therapeutic target to reverse age-related brain alterations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Selectively Imaging Cranial Sensory Ganglion Neurons Using AAV-PHP.S</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Because of their ease of use, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are indispensable tools for much of neuroscience. Yet AAVs have been used relatively little to study the identities and connectivity of peripheral sensory neurons, principally because methods to selectively target peripheral neurons have been limited. The introduction of the AAV-PHP.S capsid with enhanced tropism for peripheral neurons (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Chan et al., 2017</cross-ref>) offered a solution, which we further elaborate here. Using AAV-PHP.S with GFP or mScarlet fluorescent proteins, we show that the mouse sensory ganglia for cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X are targeted. Pseudounipolar neurons of both somatic and visceral origin, but not satellite glia, express the reporters. One week after virus injection, 66% of geniculate ganglion neurons were transduced. Fluorescent reporters were transported along the central and peripheral axons of these sensory neurons, permitting visualization of terminals at high resolution, and in intact, cleared brain using light sheet microscopy. Further, using a Cre-dependent reporter, we demonstrate by anatomic and functional criteria, that expression is in a cell type-selective manner. Finally, we integrate earlier neuroanatomical and molecular data with <I>in vivo</I> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to demonstrate the sensory characteristics of geniculate ganglion auricular neurons, which were previously undocumented. Our analyses suggest that the AAV-PHP.S serotype will be a powerful tool for anatomically and functionally mapping the receptive fields and circuits of the expanding numbers of molecular subtypes of many somatosensory and viscerosensory neurons that continue to be defined via single-cell RNA sequencing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multitask fMRI Data Classification via Group-Wise Hybrid Temporal and Spatial Sparse Representations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) has been widely used to induce functional brain activities corresponding to various cognitive tasks. A relatively under-explored question is whether there exist fundamental differences in fMRI signal composition patterns that can effectively classify the task states of tfMRI data, furthermore, whether there exist key functional components in characterizing the diverse tfMRI signals. Recently, fMRI signal composition patterns of multiple tasks have been investigated via deep learning models, where relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable and the neurologic meaning of their results is elusive. Thus, the major challenges arise from the high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, interindividual variability, a small sample size of fMRI data, and the explainability of classification results. To address the above challenges, we proposed a computational framework based on group-wise hybrid temporal and spatial sparse representations (HTSSR) to identify and differentiate multitask fMRI signal composition patterns. Using relatively small cohorts of Human Connectome Project (HCP) tfMRI data as test-bed, the experimental results demonstrated that the multitask of fMRI data can be successfully classified with an average accuracy of 96.67%, where the key components in differentiating the multitask can be characterized, suggesting the effectiveness and explainability of the proposed method. Moreover, both task-related components and resting-state networks (RSNs) can be reliably detected. Therefore, our study proposed a novel framework that identifies the interpretable and discriminative fMRI composition patterns and can be potentially applied for controlling fMRI data quality and inferring biomarkers in brain disorders with small sample neuroimaging datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-monotonic effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs on neuronal firing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aghil Abed Zadeh, Brandon D. Turner, Nicole Calakos, Nicolas Brunel</p>

GABA is generally known as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, usually acting by hyperpolarizing membrane potential. However, GABAergic currents sometimes exhibit non-inhibitory effects, depending on the brain region, developmental stage or pathological condition. Here, we investigate the diverse effects of GABA on the firing rate of several single neuron models, using both analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We find that GABAergic synaptic conductance and output firing rate exhibit three qualitatively different regimes as a function of GABA reversal potential, <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub>: monotonically decreasing for sufficiently low <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> (inhibitory), monotonically increasing for <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> above firing threshold (excitatory); and a non-monotonic region for intermediate values of <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub>. In the non-monotonic regime, small GABA conductances have an excitatory effect while large GABA conductances show an inhibitory effect. We provide a phase diagram of different GABAergic effects as a function of GABA reversal potential and glutamate conductance. We find that noisy inputs increase the range of <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> for which the non-monotonic effect can be observed. We also construct a micro-circuit model of striatum to explain observed effects of GABAergic fast spiking interneurons on spiny projection neurons, including non-monotonicity, as well as the heterogeneity of the effects. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of paradoxical effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs, with implications for understanding the effects of GABA in neural computation and development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deciphering clock cell network morphology within the biological master clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus: From the perspective of circadian wave dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hyun Kim, Cheolhong Min, Byeongha Jeong, Kyoung J. Lee</p>

The biological master clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus (of rat and mouse), is composed of ~10,000 clock cells which are heterogeneous with respect to their circadian periods. Despite this inhomogeneity, an intact SCN maintains a very good degree of circadian phase (time) coherence which is vital for sustaining various circadian rhythmic activities, and it is supposedly achieved by not just one but a few different cell-to-cell coupling mechanisms, among which action potential (AP)-mediated connectivity is known to be essential. But, due to technical difficulties and limitations in experiments, so far very little information is available about the morphology of the connectivity at a cellular scale. Building upon this limited amount of information, here we exhaustively and systematically explore a large pool (~25,000) of various network morphologies to come up with some plausible network features of SCN networks. All candidates under consideration reflect an experimentally obtained ‘indegree distribution’ as well as a ‘physical range distribution of afferent clock cells.’ Then, importantly, with a set of multitude criteria based on the properties of SCN circadian phase waves in extrinsically perturbed as well as in their natural states, we select out appropriate model networks: Some important measures are, 1) level of phase dispersal and direction of wave propagation, 2) phase-resetting ability of the model networks subject to external circadian forcing, and 3) decay rate of perturbation induced “phase-singularities.” The successful, realistic networks have several common features: 1) “indegree” and “outdegree” should have a positive correlation; 2) the cells in the SCN ventrolateral region (core) have a much larger total degree than that of the dorsal medial region (shell); 3) The number of intra-core edges is about 7.5 times that of intra-shell edges; and 4) the distance probability density function for the afferent connections fits well to a beta function. We believe that these newly identified network features would be a useful guide for future explorations on the very much unknown AP-mediated clock cell connectome within the SCN.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing collaborative transcription regulation with a graph-based deep learning approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhenhao Zhang, Fan Feng, Jie Liu</p>

Human epigenome and transcription activities have been characterized by a number of sequence-based deep learning approaches which only utilize the DNA sequences. However, transcription factors interact with each other, and their collaborative regulatory activities go beyond the linear DNA sequence. Therefore leveraging the informative 3D chromatin organization to investigate the collaborations among transcription factors is critical. We developed ECHO, a graph-based neural network, to predict chromatin features and characterize the collaboration among them by incorporating 3D chromatin organization from 200-bp high-resolution Micro-C contact maps. ECHO predicted 2,583 chromatin features with significantly higher average AUROC and AUPR than the best sequence-based model. We observed that chromatin contacts of different distances affected different types of chromatin features’ prediction in diverse ways, suggesting complex and divergent collaborative regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, ECHO was interpretable via gradient-based attribution methods. The attributions on chromatin contacts identify important contacts relevant to chromatin features. The attributions on DNA sequences identify TF binding motifs and TF collaborative binding. Furthermore, combining the attributions on contacts and sequences reveals important sequence patterns in the neighborhood which are relevant to a target sequence’s chromatin feature prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fluid mechanics of the zebrafish embryonic heart trabeculation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adriana Gaia Cairelli, Renee Wei-Yan Chow, Julien Vermot, Choon Hwai Yap</p>

Embryonic heart development is a mechanosensitive process, where specific fluid forces are needed for the correct development, and abnormal mechanical stimuli can lead to malformations. It is thus important to understand the nature of embryonic heart fluid forces. However, the fluid dynamical behaviour close to the embryonic endocardial surface is very sensitive to the geometry and motion dynamics of fine-scale cardiac trabecular surface structures. Here, we conducted image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to quantify the fluid mechanics associated with the zebrafish embryonic heart trabeculae. To capture trabecular geometric and motion details, we used a fish line that expresses fluorescence at the endocardial cell membrane, and high resolution 3D confocal microscopy. Our endocardial wall shear stress (WSS) results were found to exceed those reported in existing literature, which were estimated using myocardial rather than endocardial boundaries. By conducting simulations of single intra-trabecular spaces under varied scenarios, where the translational or deformational motions (caused by contraction) were removed, we found that a squeeze flow effect was responsible for most of the WSS magnitude in the intra-trabecular spaces, rather than the shear interaction with the flow in the main ventricular chamber. We found that trabecular structures were responsible for the high spatial variability of the magnitude and oscillatory nature of WSS, and for reducing the endocardial deformational burden. We further found cells attached to the endocardium within the intra-trabecular spaces, which were likely embryonic hemogenic cells, whose presence increased endocardial WSS. Overall, our results suggested that a complex multi-component consideration of both anatomic features and motion dynamics were needed to quantify the trabeculated embryonic heart fluid mechanics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nanoscale organization of ryanodine receptor distribution and phosphorylation pattern determines the dynamics of calcium sparks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by María Hernández Mesa, Jonas van den Brink, William E. Louch, Kimberly J. McCabe, Padmini Rangamani</p>

Super-resolution imaging techniques have provided a better understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale organization and function of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in cardiomyocytes. Recent data have indicated that this relationship is disrupted in heart failure (HF), as RyRs are dispersed into smaller and more numerous clusters. However, RyRs are also hyperphosphorylated in this condition, and this is reported to occur preferentially within the cluster centre. Thus, the combined impact of RyR relocalization and sensitization on Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark generation in failing cardiomyocytes is likely complex and these observations suggest that both the nanoscale organization of RyRs and the pattern of phosphorylated RyRs within clusters could be critical determinants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we used computational modeling to quantify the relationships between RyR cluster geometry, phosphorylation patterns, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. We found that RyR cluster disruption results in a decrease in spark fidelity and longer sparks with a lower amplitude. Phosphorylation of some RyRs within the cluster can play a compensatory role, recovering healthy spark dynamics. Interestingly, our model predicts that such compensation is critically dependent on the phosphorylation pattern, as phosphorylation localized within the cluster center resulted in longer Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and higher spark fidelity compared to a uniformly distributed phosphorylation pattern. Our results strongly suggest that both the phosphorylation pattern and nanoscale RyR reorganization are critical determinants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in HF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-checking ecological state-transition graphs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Colin Thomas, Maximilien Cosme, Cédric Gaucherel, Franck Pommereau</p>

Model-checking is a methodology developed in computer science to automatically assess the dynamics of discrete systems, by checking if a system modelled as a state-transition graph satisfies a dynamical property written as a temporal logic formula. The dynamics of ecosystems have been drawn as state-transition graphs for more than a century, ranging from state-and-transition models to assembly graphs. Model-checking can provide insights into both empirical data and theoretical models, as long as they sum up into state-transition graphs. While model-checking proved to be a valuable tool in systems biology, it remains largely underused in ecology apart from precursory applications.
This article proposes to address this situation, through an inventory of existing ecological STGs and an accessible presentation of the model-checking methodology. This overview is illustrated by the application of model-checking to assess the dynamics of a vegetation pathways model. We select management scenarios by model-checking Computation Tree Logic formulas representing management goals and built from a proposed catalogue of patterns. In discussion, we sketch bridges between existing studies in ecology and available model-checking frameworks. In addition to the automated analysis of ecological state-transition graphs, we believe that defining ecological concepts with temporal logics could help clarify and compare them.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Finding landmarks–An investigation of viewing behavior during spatial navigation in VR using a graph-theoretical analysis approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jasmin L. Walter, Lucas Essmann, Sabine U. König, Peter König</p>

Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gathering data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows one to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment. The analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined “gaze” events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention. Applying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them “gaze-graph-defined landmarks”. Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible. Our findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Burnout and work satisfaction are differentially associated in gastroenterologists in Germany [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout in the field of gastroenterology is an under-researched phenomenon. So far, only a few studies have dealt with this topic. There are large geographical variations in burnout rates with 16–20% of gastroenterologists in Mexico and Germany being at risk or having burnout, 30–40% in the United Kingdom, and 50–55% in South Korea, Canada, and the USA. The investigation of differential associations of burnout with important factors in gastroenterologists leading to tailored therapy recommendations is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the associations between work satisfaction and burnout in this specialization. Methods: We distributed an electronic survey to gastroenterologists organized mainly in the Federal Organization of Gastroenterology in Germany (the BVGD - Bundesverband Gastroenterologie Deutschland). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) were examined regarding their postulated internal structure in our sample of gastroenterologists. Canonical correlations were performed to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians. Results: An acceptable model fit was shown for both the MBI and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of .62 (p<.001) and .27 (p<.001). The full model across all functions was significant (χ2 (18) = 386.26, p<.001). Burden, personal rewards, and global item regarding the job situation were good predictors for less exhaustion, while patient care and professional relations were good predictors for personal accomplishment. This supports the recognition of burnout as being a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed. Conclusions: Specific interventions should be designed to improve symptoms of burnout in endoscopy physicians according to their individual complaints as burnout is a multidimensional construct. Differential interventions should be offered on the basis of our study results in order to alleviate the issue of work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The genetic causes of male infertility: a Middle East and North Africa perspective [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Male infertility is attributable to 60% of total infertility cases and about 30-50% of these cases remain idiopathic. In the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), male infertility affects about 22.6% of men of reproductive age. Male infertility is caused by a variety of factors, including endocrine disruption, exposure to toxins, lifestyle, genetic and epigenetic modifications. Genetic modifications, including chromosomal abnormalities, chromosomal rearrangements, Y chromosome microdeletions and single-gene mutations, explain for about 10-15% of infertility cases. Since genetic aberration is a key player in the pathogenesis of male infertility, it is important to explore the impact in the MENA region due to the high incidence of male infertility. Therefore, the current study aims to systematically analyse the literature regarding the impact and common causes of male infertility in the MENA region. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. Following the search, a total of 126 articles was retrieved, of which 12 were duplicates and another 69 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, totaling the exclusion of 81 articles. Studies excluded were those that had patient populations originating outside the MENA region, review articles, non-English written articles, or studies where the patient population was under 18 years of age. Findings showed that the frequent genetic aberration leading to male infertility in these regions include Y chromosome microdeletions, gene polymorphisms or copy number variations, mitochondrial microdeletions and other genetic deletions or mutations. In lieu of this, diverse clinical genetic tests should be made available for the proper diagnosis of male infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Realisation of Solid-State Electrochromic Devices Based on Gel Electrolyte [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the last decade, there has been much interest in the area of solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to address the issues of electrolyte leakage and evaporation in electrochromic devices (ECD). ECD is a state-of-the-art technology having the ability to change from transparent state to opaque state under the influence of a small applied voltage for energy saving applications. Methods: In this work, tungsten oxide (WO3) films were fabricated via the sol-gel spin-coating method. Subsequently, ECDs were assembled based on SPE and liquid polymer electrolyte (LPE), respectively using indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass as conducting electrodes and WO3 films as working electrode. Results: Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results revealed reduced ionic conductivity of conducting ions in SPE based ECD (SECD) owing to increased viscosity by addition of PMMA. However, lesser time was required for the colouration process. LPE based ECD (LECD) showed higher colouration efficiency (CE) compared to its SECD counterpart. This is attributed to its larger optical modulation. Conclusions: This work presents a comparison between the performance of LECD and SECD in terms of electrochromic (EC) and optical properties. They were analysed through CV, chronoamperometry (CA) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. Furthermore, this work provides an insight on the employment of solid-state electrolytes in ECDs in view of the persistent leakage and evaporation problems in ECD implementation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evaluating potential vaccine side effects is often a prerequisite to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic more effectively in a low-resource setting where herd immunity could be the most feasible option. Case report: Here, we present, an 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities was admitted into the coronary care unit at Ibn Sina Medical College Hospital (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with severe central chest pain and respiratory distress after receiving the first dose of Moderna vaccine on July 26, 2021. On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, temperature 36.7°C. He had a vesicular breath sound with bilateral basal crepitations and normal heart sounds. On the ECG, significant changes were observed. Other lab findings were significant troponin-I: 1.72 ng/ml, trace protein and glucose in the urine, total white blood cell count: 12820/cm3; HbA1c, 7.5%; serum creatinine, 1.56 mg/dl; serum electrolytes: sodium 133 mmol/L, chloride 92 mmol/L. The patient had a medical history of prior myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension but no chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, or bronchial asthma. After admission, he was treated conservatively with necessary medications and monitored periodically. The patient was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular failure with acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was discharged from the hospital on day six with proper medicinal support with full recovery. Conclusions: Though acute cardiac complications following COVID-19 vaccines are unusual, this case report can contribute to further molecular research to identify the possible role of vaccine compounds in triggering such complications among the general population.

                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr El Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Patients’ medical records were evaluated.   The oral manifestations were assessed according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in SLE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic.  Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with SLE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of SLE a widespread state. Also, the implementation of oral hygiene measures to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life is recommended.

                Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is characterized by a clinical presentation that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is reversible. Alterations of Takotsubo in patients without previous heart disease remain a challenge for diagnosis. Case report: We present a case of an 80-year-old patient from Peru. The patient underwent surgery, with the diagnosis of Chilaiditi’s syndrome. One day after surgery, she presented with dyspnea, tachycardia, and electrocardiographic changes. The diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome with cardiogenic shock and renal failure on hemodialysis was made. She was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and was managed with vasopressors and nitroglycerin. There was no cardiac lesion in the cineangiogram or occlusion of arteries. The patient was extubated and received daily dialysis until discharge. Conclusions: Takotsubo is an emotional, non-cardiac, or post-traumatic stressful event that triggers myocardial injury with segmental anomalous, the possible etiology of which is the release of an endothelial neurotransmitter caused by stress. Emergency physicians should be aware of this as even patients without previous cardiac pathologies when exposed to stressors (such as surgeries) develop emergency symptomatology similar to myocardial infarction. Thus, emergency physicians should identify any cardiac abnormalities after a stressor, as well as be prepared for the diagnosis of TC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reporting of health equity considerations in equity-relevant observational studies: Protocol for a systematic assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mitigation of unfair and avoidable differences in health is an increasing global priority. Observational studies including cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies tend to report social determinants of health which could inform evidence syntheses on health equity and social justice. However, the extent of reporting and analysis of equity in equity-relevant observational studies is unknown. Methods: We define studies which report outcomes for populations at risk of experiencing inequities as “equity-relevant”. Using a random sampling technique we will identify 320 equity-relevant observational studies published between 1 January 2020 to 27 April 2022 by searching the MEDLINE database. We will stratify sampling by 1) studies in high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) according to the World Bank classification, 2) studies focused on COVID and those which are not, 3) studies focused on populations at risk of experiencing inequities and those on general populations that stratify their analyses. We will use the PROGRESS framework which stands for place of residence, race or ethnicity, occupation, gender or sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, to identify dimensions where inequities may exist. Using a previously developed data extraction form we will pilot-test on eligible studies and revise as applicable. Conclusions: The proposed methodological assessment of reporting will allow us to systematically understand the current reporting and analysis practices for health equity in observational studies. The findings of this study will help inform the development of the equity extension for the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology) reporting guidelines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The complete genome sequence of elite bread wheat cultivar, “Sonmez” [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                High-yielding crop varieties will become critical in meeting the future food demand in the face of worsening weather extremes and threatening biotic stressors. The bread wheat cultivar Sonmez-2001 is a registered variety that is notable for its performance under low-irrigation conditions, which further improves upon irrigation. Additionally, Sonmez-2001 is resilient against certain biotic stressors, particularly soil-borne pathogens. Here, we provide a reference-guided whole genome sequence of Sonmez-2001, assembled into 21 chromosomes of the A, B and D genomes and totaling 13.3 gigabase-pairs in length. Additionally, a de novo assembly of an additional 1.05 gigabase-pairs was generated that represents either Sonmez-specific sequences or sequences that considerably diverged between Sonmez and Chinese Spring. Within this de novo assembly, we identified 35 gene models, of which 11 were high-confidence, that may contribute to the favorable traits of this high-performing variety. We identified up to 24 million sequence variants, of which up to 2.4% reside in coding sequences, that can be used to develop molecular markers that should be of immediate use to the cereal community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Optimization of the structure of bionic finger segment prosthesis using generative design [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bionic hand prosthesis helps restore the original hand function. A survey on prosthetic users concluded that 79% thought that their devices were "too heavy". Therefore, the weight of the prosthesis is a major cause of user discomfort and fatigue. This research was aimed at the reduction of hand mass bionic prosthesis by optimizing the structure of the fingers with generative design methods.  Methods: The materials used were Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic and Nylon 6, and the manufacturing method used Additive Manufacturing. The prosthesis was designed with a lighter finger structure with a max displacement of 2 mm and a maximum safety factor of 4.  Results: Generative design produced more than 80 designs. The selection of the best design was based on the status of design solutions, research limitations, visual aesthetics, recommendation values, and validation of mechanical performances.  The best is the SS-2. This design has an 80% lighter mass with the highest safety factor of 3.79, the lowest stress of 5.26 MPa, and the maximum displacement of 0.61 mm.  Conclusion: Based on the exploration scheme, the generative design could produce more than 80 design solutions. The selection of the best design was based on the status of design solutions, research limitations, visual aesthetics, recommendation values, and validation of mechanical performances in the design. Design validation was carried out by simulating finite element analysis with static stress study methods in selected design candidates with input study cases similar to generative design exploration schemes. Finally, SS – 2 design was the best design produced by the generative design method with the highest factor of safety value of 3.79. Also gives an advantage to a stress value of at least 5.26 MPa in cases of segment loading, as well as the maximum displacement value of 0.61 mm.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainable development of smart cities and smart territories based on the model of minimizing externalities [version 2; peer review: 3 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The development of conceptual models of a digital city poses numerous challenges for developers. The public sector concept model has become one of the most difficult models to use. When developing algorithms to find a solution, the multidirectional interests of businesses and public institutions are combined. This type of model reflects the most acute and urgent problems faced by megapolises with regard to combining numerous localized services provided to the community in a limited territory. The administrations of both cities and regions (the scale of the smart territories) must make decisions concerning overcoming the barriers existing between the profits of commercial structures, the negative externalities generated by their activities, and the social benefits to the population in the territory under their control. It is necessary to solve this problem to achieve the effective management of enterprises belonging to the segment of long-term participants in various business activities, interacting with the surrounding social and business environment in a complex. This study takes into account the complex structures of the economic processes characteristic of megacities. The periodicity of economic processes is also taken into account. When choosing an optimization criterion, functions reflecting the level of internalization of responsibility for external effects were considered. The authors propose a mathematical model that can be used as part of the management decision support systems software, aiming at taking into account the externalities of a wide range of national, institutional, business, and social activities.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess whether non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation at gamma-frequency (γ-tACS) applied over the precuneus can improve episodic memory and modulate cholinergic transmission by modulating cerebral rhythms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, crossover study, 60 AD patients underwent a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation including assessment of episodic memory and cholinergic transmission pre and post 60 minutes treatment with γ-tACS targeting the precuneus or sham tACS. In a subset of 10 patients, EEG analysis and individualized modelling of electric field distribution were carried out. Predictors to γ-tACS efficacy were evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant improvement in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL) test immediate recall (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and delayed recall scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) after γ-tACS but not after sham tACS. Face-name associations scores improved with γ-tACS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not after sham tACS. Short latency afferent inhibition, an indirect measure of cholinergic transmission, increased only after γ-tACS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <i>ApoE</i> genotype and baseline cognitive impairment were the best predictors of response to γ-tACS. Clinical improvement correlated with the increase in gamma frequencies in posterior regions and with the amount of predicted electric field distribution in the precuneus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Precuneus γ-tACS, able to increase γ-power activity on the posterior brain regions, showed a significant improvement of episodic memory performances, along with restoration of intracortical excitability measures of cholinergic transmission. Response to γ-tACS was dependent on genetic factors and disease stage. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate, and incidence, and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women, with the strict clinicopathological definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men, by December 31, 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4 years with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with a mean survival of 14 years from symptom onset. Survival rates from both diagnosis date and symptom onset were decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Prefrontal cortex supports speech perception in listeners with cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in people with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing, specifically in a region engaged in a separate spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment of the left prefrontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying concordant genetic effects of de novo mutations on multiple disorders</a></h4>

              
                Exome sequencing on tens of thousands of parent-proband trios has identified numerous deleterious <i>de novo</i> mutations (DNMs) and implicated risk genes for many disorders. Recent studies have suggested shared genes and pathways are enriched for DNMs across multiple disorders. However, existing analytic strategies only focus on genes that reach statistical significance for multiple disorders and require large trio samples in each study. As a result, these methods are not able to characterize the full landscape of genetic sharing due to polygenicity and incomplete penetrance. In this work, we introduce EncoreDNM, a novel statistical framework to quantify shared genetic effects between two disorders characterized by concordant enrichment of DNMs in the exome. EncoreDNM makes use of exome-wide, summary-level DNM data, including genes that do not reach statistical significance in single-disorder analysis, to evaluate the overall and annotation-partitioned genetic sharing between two disorders. Applying EncoreDNM to DNM data of nine disorders, we identified abundant pairwise enrichment correlations, especially in genes intolerant to pathogenic mutations and genes highly expressed in fetal tissues. These results suggest that EncoreDNM improves current analytic approaches and may have broad applications in DNM studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct but overlapping roles of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in developing and mature hippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                LRRTMs are postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins that have region-restricted expression in the brain. To determine their role in the molecular organization of synapses in vivo, we studied synapse development and plasticity in hippocampal neuronal circuits in mice lacking both <i>Lrrtm1</i> and <i>Lrrtm2</i>. We found that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 regulate the density and morphological integrity of excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in the developing brain but are not essential for these roles in the mature circuit. Further, they are required for long-term-potentiation in the CA3-CA1 pathway and the dentate gyrus, and for enduring fear memory in both the developing and mature brain. Our data show that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 regulate synapse development and function in a cell-type and developmental-stage-specific manner, and thereby contribute to the fine-tuning of hippocampal circuit connectivity and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sleep-dependent upscaled excitability, saturated neuroplasticity, and modulated cognition in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Sleep strongly affects synaptic strength, making it critical for cognition, especially learning, and memory formation. Whether and <i>how</i> sleep deprivation modulates human brain physiology and cognition is not well understood. Here we examined how overnight sleep deprivation vs overnight sufficient sleep affects (a) cortical excitability, measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), (b) inducibility of LTP- and-LTD-like plasticity via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and (c) learning, memory and attention. The results suggest that sleep deprivation upscales cortical excitability due to enhanced glutamate-related cortical facilitation and decreased and/or reversed GABAergic cortical inhibition. Furthermore, tDCS-induced LTP-like plasticity abolishes while the inhibitory LTD-like plasticity converts to excitatory LTP-like plasticity under sleep deprivation. This is associated with increased EEG theta oscillations due to sleep pressure. Finally, we show that learning and memory formation, behavioral counterparts of plasticity, and working memory and attention, which rely on cortical excitability, are impaired during sleep deprivation. Our data suggest that upscaled brain excitability, and altered plasticity, due to sleep deprivation, are associated with impaired cognitive performance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct roles for two Caenorhabditis elegans acid-sensing ion channels in an ultradian clock</a></h4>

              
                Biological clocks are fundamental to an organism’s health, controlling periodicity of behaviour and metabolism. Here, we identify two acid-sensing ion channels, with very different proton sensing properties, and describe their role in an ultradian clock, the defecation motor program (DMP) of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. An ACD-5-containing channel, on the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium, is essential for maintenance of luminal acidity, and thus the rhythmic oscillations in lumen pH. In contrast, the second channel, composed of FLR-1, ACD-3 and/or DEL-5, located on the basolateral membrane, controls the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave and forms a core component of the master oscillator that controls timing and rhythmicity of the DMP. <i>flr-1</i> and <i>acd-3/del-5</i> mutants show severe developmental and metabolic defects. We thus directly link the proton-sensing properties of these channels to their physiological roles in pH regulation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, the generation of an ultradian oscillator, and its metabolic consequences.

                Analyses across imaging modalities allow the integration of complementary spatiotemporal information about brain development, structure and function. However, systematic atlasing across modalities is limited by challenges to effective image alignment. We combine highly spatially resolved electron microscopy (EM) and highly temporally resolved time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (FM) to examine the emergence of a complex nervous system in <i>C. elegans</i> embryogenesis. We generate an EM time series at four classic developmental stages and create a landmark-based co-optimization algorithm for cross-modality image alignment, which handles developmental heterochrony among datasets to achieve accurate single-cell level alignment. Synthesis based on the EM series and time-lapse FM series carrying different cell-specific markers reveals critical dynamic behaviors across scales of identifiable individual cells in the emergence of the primary neuropil, the nerve ring, as well as a major sensory organ, the amphid. Our study paves the way for systematic cross-modality data synthesis in <i>C. elegans</i> and demonstrates a powerful approach that may be applied broadly.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Strength of interactions in the Notch gene regulatory network determines patterning and fate in the notochord</a></h4>

              
                Development of multicellular organisms requires the generation of gene expression patterns that determines cell fate and organ shape. Groups of genetic interactions known as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) play a key role in the generation of such patterns. However, how the topology and parameters of GRNs determine patterning <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear due to the complexity of most experimental systems. To address this, we use the zebrafish notochord, an organ where coin-shaped precursor cells are initially arranged in a simple unidimensional geometry. These cells then differentiate into vacuolated and sheath cells. Using newly developed transgenic tools together with <i>in vivo</i> imaging, we identify <i>jag1a</i> and <i>her6</i>/<i>her9</i> as the main components of a Notch GRN that generates a lateral inhibition pattern and determines cell fate. Making use of this experimental system and mathematical modeling we show that lateral inhibition patterning is promoted when ligand-receptor interactions are stronger within the same cell than in neighboring cells. Altogether, we establish the zebrafish notochord as an experimental system to study pattern generation, and identify and characterize how the properties of GRNs determine self-organization of gene patterning and cell fate.

                <b>Background:</b> The variation in the pathogen type as well as the spatial heterogeneity of predictors make the generality of any associations with pathogen discovery debatable. Our previous work confirmed that the association of a group of predictors differed across different types of RNA viruses, yet there have been no previous comparisons of the specific predictors for RNA virus discovery in different regions. The aim of the current study was to close the gap by investigating whether predictors of discovery rates within three regions-the United States, China, and Africa-differ from one another and from those at the global level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Species-specific sensitivity to TGFβ signaling and changes to the Mmp13 promoter underlie avian jaw development and evolution</a></h4>

              
                Precise developmental control of jaw length is critical for survival, but underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The jaw skeleton arises from neural crest mesenchyme (NCM), and we previously demonstrated that these progenitor cells express more bone-resorbing enzymes including <i>Matrix metalloproteinase 13</i> (<i>Mmp13)</i> when they generate shorter jaws in quail embryos versus longer jaws in duck. Moreover, if we inhibit bone resorption or <i>Mmp13</i>, we can increase jaw length. In the current study, we uncover mechanisms establishing species-specific levels of <i>Mmp13</i> and bone resorption. Quail show greater activation of, and sensitivity to <i>Transforming Growth Factor-Beta</i> (<i>TGFβ</i>) signaling than duck; where mediators like SMADs and targets like <i>Runx2</i>, which bind <i>Mmp13</i>, become elevated. Inhibiting TGFβ signaling decreases bone resorption and overexpressing <i>Mmp13</i> in NCM shortens the duck lower jaw. To elucidate the basis for this differential regulation we examine the <i>Mmp13</i> promoter. We discover a SMAD binding element and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near a RUNX2 binding element that distinguish quail from duck. Altering the SMAD site and switching the SNPs abolishes TGFβ-sensitivity in the quail <i>Mmp13</i> promoter but makes the duck promoter responsive. Thus, differential regulation of TGFβ signaling and <i>Mmp13</i> promoter structure underlie avian jaw development and evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A general decoding strategy explains the relationship between behavior and correlated variability</a></h4>

              
                Improvements in perception are frequently accompanied by decreases in correlated variability in sensory cortex. This relationship is puzzling because overall changes in correlated variability should minimally affect optimal information coding. We hypothesize that this relationship arises because instead of using optimal strategies for decoding the specific stimuli at hand, observers prioritize <i>generality</i>: a single set of neuronal weights to decode any stimuli. We tested this using a combination of multineuron recordings in the visual cortex of behaving rhesus monkeys and a cortical circuit model. We found that general decoders optimized for broad rather than narrow sets of visual stimuli better matched the animals’ decoding strategy, and that their performance was more related to the magnitude of correlated variability. In conclusion, the inverse relationship between perceptual performance and correlated variability can be explained by observers using a general decoding strategy, capable of decoding neuronal responses to the variety of stimuli encountered in natural vision.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hydrodynamic model of fish orientation in a channel flow</a></h4>

              
                For over a century, scientists have sought to understand how fish orient against an incoming flow, even without visual and flow cues. Here, we elucidate a potential hydrodynamic mechanism of rheotaxis through the study of the bidirectional coupling between fish and the surrounding fluid. By modeling a fish as a vortex dipole in an infinite channel with an imposed background flow, we establish a planar dynamical system for the cross-stream coordinate and orientation. The system dynamics captures the existence of a critical flow speed for fish to successfully orient while performing cross-stream, periodic sweeping movements. Model predictions are examined in the context of experimental observations in the literature on the rheotactic behavior of fish deprived of visual and lateral line cues. The crucial role of bidirectional hydrodynamic interactions unveiled by this model points at an overlooked limitation of existing experimental paradigms to study rheotaxis in the laboratory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transposon mutagenesis in Mycobacterium abscessus identifies an essential penicillin-binding protein involved in septal peptidoglycan synthesis and antibiotic sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (<i>Mab</i>) is a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) that causes a wide range of infections. Treatment of <i>Mab</i> infections is difficult because the bacterium is intrinsically resistant to many classes of antibiotics. Developing new and effective treatments against <i>Mab</i> requires a better understanding of the unique vulnerabilities that can be targeted for future drug development. To achieve this, we identified essential genes in <i>Mab</i> by conducting transposon sequencing (TnSeq) on the reference <i>Mab</i> strain ATCC 19977. We generated ~51,000 unique transposon mutants and used this high-density library to identify 362 essential genes for in vitro growth. To investigate species-specific vulnerabilities in <i>Mab</i>, we further characterized <i>MAB_3167c</i>, a predicted penicillin-binding protein and hypothetical lipoprotein (PBP-lipo) that is essential in <i>Mab</i> and non-essential in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>). We found that PBP-lipo primarily localizes to the subpolar region and later to the septum as cells prepare to divide. Depletion of <i>Mab</i> PBP-lipo causes cells to elongate, develop ectopic branches, and form multiple septa. Knockdown of PBP-lipo along with PbpB, DacB1, and a carboxypeptidase, MAB_0519 lead to synergistic growth arrest. In contrast, these genetic interactions were absent in the <i>Mtb</i> model organism, <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>, indicating that the PBP-lipo homologs in the two species exist in distinct genetic networks. Finally, repressing PBP-lipo sensitized the reference strain and 11 <i>Mab</i> clinical isolates to several classes of antibiotics, including the β-lactams, ampicillin, and amoxicillin by greater than 128-fold. Altogether, this study presents PBP-lipo as a key enzyme to study <i>Mab</i>-specific processes in cell wall synthesis and importantly positions PBP-lipo as an attractive drug target to treat <i>Mab</i> infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected dying cells impairs macrophage anti-inflammatory functions and clearance of apoptotic cells</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 is a disease of dysfunctional immune responses, but the mechanisms triggering immunopathogenesis are not established. The functional plasticity of macrophages allows this cell type to promote pathogen elimination and inflammation or suppress inflammation and promote tissue remodeling and injury repair. During an infection, the clearance of dead and dying cells, a process named efferocytosis, can modulate the interplay between these contrasting functions. Here, we show that engulfment of SARS-CoV2-infected apoptotic cells exacerbates inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits the expression of efferocytic receptors, and impairs continual efferocytosis by macrophages. We also provide evidence supporting that lung monocytes and macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients have compromised efferocytic capacity. Our findings reveal that dysfunctional efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell corpses suppress macrophage anti-inflammation and efficient tissue repair programs and provide mechanistic insights for the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and accumulation of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cells use molecular working memory to navigate inchanging chemoattractant fields</a></h4>

              
                In order to migrate over large distances, cells within tissues and organisms rely on sensing local gradient cues which are irregular, conflicting, and changing over time and space. The mechanism how they generate persistent directional migration when signals are disrupted, while still remaining adaptive to signal's localization changes remain unknown. Here we find that single cells utilize a molecular mechanism akin to a working memory to satisfy these two opposing demands. We derive theoretically that this is characteristic for receptor networks maintained away from steady states. Time-resolved live-cell imaging of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation dynamics shows that cells transiently memorize position of encountered signals via slow-escaping remnant of the polarized signaling state, a dynamical 'ghost', driving memory-guided persistent directional migration. The metastability of this state further enables migrational adaptation when encountering new signals. We thus identify basic mechanism of real-time computations underlying cellular navigation in changing chemoattractant fields.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genome editing in the unicellular holozoan Capsaspora owczarzaki suggests a premetazoan role for the Hippo pathway in multicellular morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Animal development is mediated by a surprisingly small set of canonical signaling pathways such as Wnt, Hedgehog, TGF-beta, Notch, and Hippo pathways. Although once thought to be present only in animals, recent genome sequencing has revealed components of these pathways in the closest unicellular relatives of animals. These findings raise questions about the ancestral functions of these developmental pathways and their potential role in the emergence of animal multicellularity. Here, we provide the first functional characterization of any of these developmental pathways in unicellular organisms by developing techniques for genetic manipulation in <i>Capsaspora owczarzaki</i>, a close unicellular relative of animals that displays aggregative multicellularity. We then use these tools to characterize the <i>Capsaspora</i> ortholog of the Hippo signaling nuclear effector YAP/TAZ/Yorkie (coYki), a key regulator of tissue size in animals. In contrast to what might be expected based on studies in animals, we show that coYki is dispensable for cell proliferation but regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and the three-dimensional (3D) shape of multicellular structures. We further demonstrate that the cytoskeletal abnormalities of individual coYki mutant cells underlie the abnormal 3D shape of coYki mutant aggregates. Taken together, these findings implicate an ancestral role for the Hippo pathway in cytoskeletal dynamics and multicellular morphogenesis predating the origin of animal multicellularity, which was co-opted during evolution to regulate cell proliferation.

                Profilin-1 (PFN1) is a cytoskeletal protein that regulates the dynamics of actin and microtubule assembly. Thus, PFN1 is essential for the normal division, motility, and morphology of cells. Unfortunately, conventional fusion and direct labeling strategies compromise different facets of PFN1 function. As a consequence, the only methods used to determine known PFN1 functions have been indirect and often deduced in cell-free biochemical assays. We engineered and characterized two genetically encoded versions of tagged PFN1 that behave identical to each other and the tag-free protein. In biochemical assays purified proteins bind to PIP lipids, catalyze nucleotide exchange on actin monomers, stimulate formin-mediated actin filament assembly, and impact microtubule dynamics. Halo-PFN1 or mApple-PFN1 restored morphological and cytoskeletal functions in PFN1-deficient mammalian cells. In biochemical assays, mAp-PFN1 bound tubulin dimers (k<sub>D</sub> = 1.89 µM) and the sides of microtubules in vitro. Titrations of self-labeling Halo-ligands were used to visualize molecules of PFN1. This approach combined with specific function-disrupting point-mutants (Y6D and R88E) revealed PFN1 bound to microtubules in live cells. Cells expressing the ALS-associated G118V disease variant did not associate with actin filaments or microtubules. Thus, these tagged PFN1s are reliable tools for studying the dynamic interactions of PFN1 with actin or microtubules in vitro as well as in important cell processes or disease-states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal assessment of brain structure and behavior in youth with rapid weight gain: Potential contributing causes and consequences</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Independent of weight status, rapid weight gain has been associated with underlying brain structure variation in regions associated with food intake and impulsivity among pre-adolescents. Yet, we lack clarity on how developmental maturation coincides with rapid weight gain and weight stability. Methods: We identified brain predictors of two-year rapid weight gain and its longitudinal effects on brain structure and impulsivity in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study. Youth were categorized as Healthy Weight/Weight Stable (WSHW, n=225) or Weight Gainers (WG, n=221, >38lbs); 63% of the WG group were healthy weight at 9-to-10-years-old. Results: A five-fold cross-validated logistic elastic-net regression revealed that rapid weight gain was associated with structural variation amongst 39 brain features at 9-to-10-years-old in regions involved with executive functioning, appetitive control, and reward sensitivity. Two years later, WG youth showed differences in change over time in several of these regions and performed worse on measures of impulsivity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that brain structure in pre-adolescence may predispose some to rapid weight gain and that weight gain itself may alter maturational brain change in regions important for food intake and impulsivity. Behavioral interventions that target inhibitory control may improve trajectories of brain maturation and facilitate healthier behaviors.

                Motor behavior requires the balanced production and integration of a variety of neural cell types. Motor neurons are positioned in discrete locations in the ventral spinal cord, targeting specific muscles to drive locomotive contractions. Specialized spinal interneurons modulate and synchronize motor neuron activity to achieve coordinated motor output. Changes in the ratios of spinal interneurons could drastically alter motor output by tipping the balance of inhibition and excitation onto target motor neurons. Importantly, individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and associated autism spectrum disorders often have significant motor challenges, including repetitive behaviors and epilepsy. FXS stems from the transcriptional silencing of the gene Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1), which encodes an RNA binding protein that is implicated in a multitude of crucial neurodevelopmental processes, including cell specification. We find that zebrafish fmr1 mutants generate surplus ventral lateral descending (VeLD) interneurons, an early-born cell derived from the pMN domain. These GABAergic interneurons are also associated with changes in synaptogenesis, as fmr1 mutants show increased early expression of the scaffold Gephyrin, but these postsynaptic sites fail to mature. Our work shows that Fmrp regulates the proportionate production of neurons that comprise early embryonic motor circuits. As VeLD interneurons are hypothesized to act as central pattern generators driving the earliest spontaneous movements, this imbalance could profoundly influence the formation and long-term function of motor circuits driving locomotion.

                Are there regions in a color space where color categories are invariant across illuminant changes? If so, what characteristics make them more stable than other regions? To address these questions, we asked observers to give a color name to 424 colored surfaces, presented one at a time, under various chromatic illuminants. Results showed a high degree of categorical color constancy, especially under illuminants that occur in the natural environment. It was also shown that surfaces selected as a focal color (the best example of a color category) are more resistant to illuminant change than non-focal color samples. This might imply that categorically invariant regions might have become focal colors to facilitate object identification and communication with others under a variety of lighting environments. We additionally ran an asymmetric color matching experiment to quantify the shift of color appearance induced by illuminant changes using surfaces that were all named gray, thereby disentangling the appearance-based color constancy from the categorical color constancy (which are often confounded). Results suggested that the appearance of color samples largely shifted due to illuminant changes even though all samples were named gray; showing that the constancy of a color category is substantially more robust than the constancy of color appearance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated detection of extracellular action potentials from single neurons</a></h4>

              
                Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) non-invasively record extracellular action potentials (eAPs, also known as spikes) from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. However, because extracellular electrodes sample from the local electrical field, each electrode can detect eAPs from multiple nearby neurons. Interpreting spike trains at individual electrodes of high-density arrays requires spike sorting, a computational process which groups eAPs from single 'units' based on assumptions of how spike waveforms correlate with different neuronal sources. Additionally, when experimental conditions result in changes to eAP waveforms, spike sorting routines may have difficulty correlating eAPs from multiple neurons at single electrodes before and after such waveform changes. We present here a novel, empirical method for unambiguously isolating eAPs from individual, uniquely identifiable neurons, based on automated multi-point detection of action potential propagation. This method is insensitive to changes in eAP waveform morphology because it makes no assumptions about the relationship between spike waveform and neuronal source. Our algorithm for automated detection of action potential propagation produces a 'fingerprint' that uniquely identifies those spikes from each neuron. By unambiguously isolating eAPs from multiple neurons in each recording, on a range of platforms and experimental preparations, our method now enables high-content screening with contemporary MEAs. We outline the limitations and strengths of propagation-based isolation of eAPs from single neurons and propose how our automated method complements spike sorting and could be adapted to in vivo use.

Marijuana-induced WM deficits have been ascribed to the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which acts at CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1r). Recent work emphasized the role of CB1r and cholinergic interaction across this cognitive domain without formal anatomical demonstration. We generated mice with a conditional deletion of CB1r on cholinergic neuron terminals, and WM was evaluated in operant chambers. Control of physiological variables (temperature, nociception, neuromuscular function) was also performed, and additional motor, motivation, time estimation behaviors, and effort-based decision-making. Discrete WM enhancement measured in a novel Delay-Non-Matching-To-Position task was evidenced that incorporates early acquisition during randomized delays (mixed procedure), and remarkably, improved performance when these (2s, 8s, 16s, 20s) were kept constant (same procedure) across a testing block of trials. We reported sustained motivation in an exponential progressive ratio schedule whilst locomotor activity did not differ between genotypes in the rotarod and open field. However, timing behavior was modified as indicated by higher discriminated motor responses for the shortest interval in conditional deleted mice in the Fixed-Interval task (10s, 30s). We reported no effect on effort-based decision-making. Our work outlines presynaptic CB1r- cholinergic neuron function(s), and the hippocampus, neocortex, and amygdala brain regions as critical loci through known basal forebrain efferent projections possibly involved in WM and motivation in marijuana intoxication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving the efficacy and accessibility of intracranial viral vector delivery in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Non-human primates (NHPs) are precious resources for cutting edge neuroscientific research, including large-scale viral vector-based experimentation such as optogenetics. We propose to improve surgical outcomes by enhancing surgical preparation practices of convection-enhanced delivery (CED), which is an efficient viral vector infusion technique for large brains such as NHPs'. Here we present both real-time and next-day MRI data of CED in the brains of ten NHPs, and we present a quantitative, inexpensive, and practical bench-side model of the in vivo CED data. Our bench-side model is composed of food coloring infused into a transparent agar phantom, and the spread of infusion is optically monitored over time. Our proposed method approximates CED infusions into the cortex, thalamus, medial temporal lobe and caudate nucleus of NHPs, confirmed by MRI data acquired with either gadolinium-based or manganese-based contrast agents co-infused with optogenetic viral vectors. These methods and data serve to guide researchers and surgical team members in key surgical preparations for intracranial viral delivery using CED in NHPs, and thus improve expression targeting and efficacy and, as a result, reduce surgical risks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Silicone Oil-Induced Glaucomatous Neurodegeneration in Rhesus Macaques</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we developed a simple procedure of intracameral injection of silicone oil (SO) in mouse eyes and established the mouse SOHU (SO-induced ocular hypertension) glaucoma model with reversible intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and significant glaucomatous neurodegeneration (Zhang et al, eLife 2019). Because the anatomy of the non-human primate (NHP) visual system closely resembles that of humans, it is the most likely to predict human responses to diseases and therapies. Here we replicated the SOHU glaucoma model in rhesus macaque monkeys. One animal presented characteristic human glaucoma pathophysiological features within 6 months after SO injection, including reversible IOP elevation, optic nerve head (ONH) cupping, quadrant specific RNFL thinning, and decrease of the photopic negative response, in addition to significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and optic nerve (ON) degeneration. Additional animals showed similar glaucomatous degeneration and visual functional deficit at both 3 and 6 months, however, with a unique dynamic change of IOP. This novel NHP SOHU glaucoma model recapitulates phenotypes of human patients, and is therefore highly suitable for studying primate RGC/ON morphology and function in response to ocular hypertension, assessing pre-clinically neuroprotective and regenerative therapies, and therefore for translating relevant findings into novel and efficient treatments in patients with glaucoma and other neurodegenerations.

                GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The repeat is bidirectionally transcribed and confers gain of toxicity. However, the underlying toxic species is debated, and it is not clear whether antisense CCCCGG (C4G2) repeat expanded RNAs contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our study shows that C9orf72 (C4G2) antisense repeat expanded RNAs trigger the activation of the PKR/eIF2-dependent integrated stress response independent of dipeptide repeat proteins that are produced through repeat-associated non-AUG initiated translation, leading to global translation inhibition and stress granule formation. Increased phosphorylation of PKR/eIF2 is also observed in the frontal cortex of C9orf72 FTD/ALS patients. Finally, only antisense (C4G2), but not sense (G4C2), repeat expanded RNAs can activate the PKR/eIF2 pathway. These results provide a mechanism by which antisense repeat expanded RNAs elicit neuronal toxicity in FTD/ALS caused by C9orf72 repeat expansions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Short superficial white matter and aging: a longitudinal multi-site study of 1,293 subjects and 2,711 sessions</a></h4>

              
                It is estimated that short association fibers, or 'U-shaped' fibers running immediately beneath the cortex, may make up as much as 60% of the total white matter volume. However, these have been understudied relative to the long-range association, projection, and commissural fibers of the brain. This is largely because of limitations of diffusion MRI fiber tractography, which is the primary methodology used to non-invasively study the white matter connections. Inspired by recent anatomical considerations and methodological improvements in U-fiber tractography, we aim to characterize changes in these fiber systems in cognitively normal aging, which provide insight into the biological foundation of age-related cognitive changes, and a better understanding of how age-related pathology differs from healthy aging. To do this, we used three large, longitudinal and cross-sectional datasets (N = 1293 subjects, 2711 sessions) to quantify microstructural features and length/volume features of several U-fiber systems. We find that axial, radial, and mean diffusivities show positive associations with age, while fractional anisotropy has negative associations with age in superficial white matter throughout the entire brain. These associations were most pronounced in the frontal, temporal, and temporoparietal regions. Moreover, measures of U-fiber volume and length decrease with age in a heterogenous manner across the brain, with prominent effects observed for pre- and post-central gyri. These features, and their variations with age, provide the background for characterizing normal aging, and, in combination with larger association pathways and gray matter microstructural features, may provide insight into fundamental mechanisms associated with aging and cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relating neighborhood deprivation to childhood obesity in the ABCD Study(R): evidence for theories of neuroinflammation and neuronal stress</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We evaluated whether the relationships between area deprivation (ADI), body mass index (BMI) and brain structure (e.g., cortical thickness, subcortical volume) during pre-adolescence supported the neuroinflammation (NI) and/or neuronal stress (NS) theories of overeating. The NI theory proposes that ADI causes structural alteration in the brain due to the neuroinflammatory effects of overeating unhealthy foods. The NS theory proposes that ADI-related stress negatively impacts brain structure, which causes stress-related overeating and subsequent obesity. Methods: Data were gathered from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (9-12-years-old; n=2872, 51.3% female). Linear mixed-effects models identified brain regions that were associated with both ADI and BMI; longitudinal mediation models assessed potential causal pathways. The NI model included ADI and BMI at 9/10-years-old and brain data at 11/12-years-old. The NS model included ADI and brain data at 9/10-years-old and BMI at 11/12-years-old. Results: In the NI model, BMI at 9/10-years-old positively mediated the relationship between AD and cortical thinning in the cuneus, lingual, and paracentral gyrus and larger volume of the Ventral DC at 11/12-years-old. In the NS model, cortical thinning in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, lingual gyrus and larger volume of the Ventral DC at 9/10-years-old partially mediated the relationship between ADI and BMI at 11/12-years-old. Conclusion: Greater area deprivation may indicate fewer access to resources that support healthy development, like nutritious food and non-stressful environments. Our findings provide evidence in support of the neuroinflammation and stress theories of overeating, specifically, with greater ADI influencing health outcomes of obesity via brain structure alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluation of Blood-Based Exosomes as Biomarkers for Aging-Related TDP-43 pathology</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Limbic predominant age related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a recently characterized brain disease that mimics Alzheimers disease (AD) clinically. To date, LATE is difficult to diagnose antemortem using clinical information or biomarkers. Recent studies suggest concentrations of exosomal protein cargo derived from neuronal and glial cells may serve as useful diagnostic biomarkers for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: TDP-43 was evaluated in neuronal (NDE), astrocyte (ADE), and microglial derived exosomes (MDE). Exosome preparations were isolated from the plasma of research subjects with autopsy-confirmed diagnoses, including many with LATE. Quantified TDP-43 concentrations were compared to cohort that included healthy controls, mild cognitively impairment (MCI), and AD dementia with diagnoses other than LATE. RESULTS: TDP-43 was significantly elevated in plasma ADEs derived from autopsy confirmed LATE-NC subjects, with or without comorbid AD pathology. Measurable levels of TDP-43 were also detected in exosome depleted plasma; however, TDP-43 levels were not significantly different between persons with and without eventual autopsy confirmed LATE-NC. No correlation was observed between exosomal TDP-43 levels with cognition-based variables, sex, and APOE carrier status. DISCUSSION: Blood-based exosomes, specifically measuring TDP-43 accumulation in ADEs, may serve as a powerful diagnostic tool to rapidly identify subjects who are currently living with LATE-NC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive steering: Integration of artificial motor signals in self-motion estimation</a></h4>

              
                The brain's computations for active and passive self-motion estimation can be unified with a single model that optimally combines vestibular and visual signals with sensory predictions based on motor efference copies. It is unknown whether this theoretical framework also applies to the integration of artificial motor signals, like the motor signals that occur when driving a car. Here, we examined if training humans to control a self-motion platform would lead to the construction of an accurate internal model of the mapping between the steering movement and the vestibular reafference. Participants (n = 15) were seated on a linear motion platform and actively controlled the platform's velocity using a steering wheel to translate their body to a memorized visual target location (Motion condition). We compared their steering behavior to that of participants (n = 15) who remained stationary and instead aligned a non-visible line with the target (Stationary condition). To probe learning, the gain between the steering wheel angle and the platform velocity or line velocity changed abruptly twice during the experiment. These gain changes were virtually undetectable in the displacement error in the Motion condition, whereas clear deviations were observed in the Stationary condition. These results show that participants in the Motion condition made within-trial changes to their steering behavior immediately after the gain changes. This suggests that they continuously compared the vestibular reafference to internal predictions, and thus employed and updated an internal forward model of the mapping between the steering movement and the vestibular reafference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artificial neural network modelling of the neural population code underlying mathematical operations</a></h4>

              
                Mathematical operations have long been regarded as a sparse, symbolic process in neuroimaging studies. In contrast, advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) have enabled extracting distributed representations of mathematical operations. Recent neuroimaging studies have compared distributed representations of the visual, auditory and language domains in ANNs and biological neural networks (BNNs). However, such a relationship has not yet been examined in mathematics. Here we used the fMRI data of a series of mathematical problems with nine different combinations of operators to construct voxel-wise encoding models using both sparse operator and latent ANN features. Representational similarity analysis demonstrated shared representations between ANN and BNN, an effect particularly evident in the intraparietal sulcus. Feature-brain similarity analysis served to reconstruct a sparse representation of mathematical operations based on distributed ANN features. Such reconstruction was more efficient when using features from deeper ANN layers. Moreover, latent ANN features allowed the decoding of novel operators not used during model training from brain activity. The current study provides novel insights into the neural code underlying mathematical thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Language Models Learn Sentiment and Substance from 11,000 Psychoactive Experiences</a></h4>

              
                Drugs like entactogens and psychedelics appear poised to enter clinical psychiatry, however we lack a unified framework for quantifying the changes in conscious awareness optimal for treatment. We address this need using transformers (i.e. BERT) and 11,821 publicly-available, natural language testimonials from Erowid. First, we predicted 28 dimensions of sentiment across each narrative, validated with clinical psychiatrist annotations. Secondly, another model was trained to predict biochemical (pharmacological and chemical class, molecule name, receptor affinity) as well as demographic (sex, age) information from the testimonials. Thirdly, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) linked the 52 drugs' affinities for 61 receptor subtypes with word usage across the testimonials, revealing 11 latent receptor-experience factors each mapped to a 3D cortical atlas of receptor gene-expression. Together, these 3 machine learning methods elucidate a neurobiologically-informed, temporally-sensitive portrait of drug-induced subjective experiences. These models are mutually confirmatory, pointing to an underlying structure of psychoactive experience dominated by the distinction between the lucid and the mundane, but also sensitive to effects unique to individual drugs. For example, MDMA was singularly linked to mid-experience swelling of "Love", potent psychedelics like DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT were associated with "Mystical Experiences", while other tryptamines were associated with an emotional constellation of "Surprise", "Curiosity" and "Realization". Applying these models to real-time biofeedback (e.g. EEG, or MRI) with zero-shot learning that tunes the sentimental trajectory of the experience through changes in audiovisual outputs, practitioners could guide the course of therapeutic sessions, maximizing benefit and minimizing harm for patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved Version of ChETA Promotes Aggression in the Medial Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The development of optogenetic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of neural circuits and behavior. The medial amygdala, posterior dorsal subdivision (MeApd) is part of a distributed network controlling social behaviors such as mating and aggression. Previous work showed that activation of GABAergic neurons in mouse MeApd using channelrodopsin-2 (ChR2H134R) promoted aggression. In a recent study, Baleisyte et al. (2022) confirmed these findings using the same reagents (i.e. ChR2H134R), but also reported that a different ChR2 variant with faster kinetics--ChETA1.0--inhibited rather than promoted aggression when high laser power, long duration photostimulation conditions were used. As ChETA1.0 is known to have a substantially lower photocurrent than ChR2 and other opsins, an improved version of ChETA (i.e. ChR2E123T/T159C; "ChETA2.0") was subsequently developed. ChETA2.0 has larger photocurrents than ChETA1.0 while maintaining fast kinetics and low plateau depolarization. Here we show that activating MeApd GABAergic neurons using ChETA2.0 promotes aggression, similar to ChR2H134R, suggesting that the results obtained using ChETA1.0 are not due to a difference in channel kinetics. Furthermore, we found that ChETA2.0 is capable of driving a rapid onset of aggression within 200-300 milliseconds of stimulation, suggesting that this effect reflects direct activation of MeApd GABAergic neurons. We conclude that the different behavioral phenotypes observed using ChETA1.0 vs. ChETA2.0 and ChR2 likely reflects the weaker photocurrents in ChETA1.0 vs. other opsins, and/or the long duration/high power photostimulation conditions used with ChETA1.0. Consistent with this conclusion, the results obtained using ChR2 or ChETA2.0 are complementary to findings from loss-of-functions experiments using optogenetic inhibition, chemogenetic inhibition, and neuronal ablation. These data support a positive-acting role of MeApd Vgat+ neurons in aggression. Our findings, in conjunction with studies of Berndt et al. (2011), suggest that the improved ChETA2.0 should be used when faster kinetics than ChR2 offers are required.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Technologically-Assisted Communication Attenuates Inter-Brain Synchrony</a></h4>

              
                The transition to technologically-assisted communication has permeated all facets of human social life; yet, its impact on the social brain is still unknown and the effects may be most notable during key developmental transitions. Applying a two-brain perspective, the current pre-registered study measured mother-child brain-to-brain synchrony using hyperscanning EEG at the transition to adolescence during live face-to-face interaction versus technologically-assisted remote communication. The live interaction elicited 9 significant cross-brain links between densely inter-connected frontal and temporal areas in the beta range [14-30 Hz]. Mother's right frontal region connected with child's right and left frontal, temporal, and central regions, suggesting its regulatory role in organizing the two-brain dynamics. In contrast, the remote interaction elicited only 1 significant cross-brain-cross-hemisphere link, attenuating the robust right-to-right-brain connectivity during live social moments that communicates socio-affective signals. Furthermore, while the level of social behavior was comparable between the two interactions, brain-behavior links emerged only during the live exchange, suggesting that remote interactions yield a somewhat thinner biobehavioral experience. Mother-child right temporal-temporal synchrony linked with moments of shared gaze and the degree of child engagement and empathic behavior was associated with right frontal-frontal synchrony. Our findings indicate that human co-presence is underpinned by specific neurobiological processes, suggest potential reasons for "zoom fatigue", and open a much-needed discussion on the cost of social technology for brain maturation, particularly among youth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical synapses of the world's smallest mammal: an FIB/SEM study in the Etruscan shrew</a></h4>

              
                The main aim of the present study was to determine if synapses from the exceptionally small brain of the Etruscan shrew show any peculiarities compared to the much larger human brain. This study constitutes the first description of the Etruscan shrew synaptic characteristics using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM). We analyzed the synaptic density and a variety of structural characteristics of 7,239 3D reconstructed synapses, obtaining the following major results: (i) cortical synaptic density was very high, particularly in layer I; (ii) the vast majority of synapses were excitatory, with the highest proportion found in layer I; (iii) excitatory synapses were larger than inhibitory synapses in all layers except in layer VI; and (iv) synapses were either randomly distributed in space or showed a slight tendency to be organised in a regular arrangement. Some of these general synaptic characteristics are remarkably similar to those found in the human cerebral cortex. However, the cortical volume of the human brain is about 50,000 times larger than the cortical volume of the Etruscan shrew, while the total number of cortical synapses in human is only 20,000 times the number of synapses in the shrew, and synaptic junctions are 35% smaller in the Etruscan shrew. Thus, the differences in the number and size of synapses cannot be attributed to a brain size scaling effect but rather to adaptations of synaptic circuits to particular functions. The present work provides a quantitative dataset from the Etruscan shrew synapses- not only contributing to the knowledge of the ultrastructure of the mammalian cortex, but also identifying common and differing principles of synaptic organization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The magnocellular division of the human medial geniculate nucleus preferentially responds to auditory transients</a></h4>

              
                The medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), the auditory relay in the thalamus, is composed of three anatomical subdivisions: the ventral, dorsal and medial or magnocellular division. The functional differences among these nuclei have not been studied in humans, and in particular, the function of the magnocellular division is poorly understood in mammals in general. We anatomically segmented the MGN using proton-density-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) and measured the functional responses of the MGN to sustained and transient sounds, using functional MRI (fMRI). We observed that voxels in the ventromedial portion of the MGN, corresponding to the magnocellular division, exhibited a strong preference to transient sounds, whereas the remainder of the MGN showed no preference between sustained and transient sounds. We concluded that the magnocellular neurons in the MGN parallel the magnocellular neurons in its visual counterpart, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and constitute an information stream specialized for encoding stimuli dynamics.

	<p>The involvement of the dopamine system in modulating time perception has been widely reported. Clinical conditions (e.g., Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, addictions) that alter dopaminergic signaling have been shown to affect motor timing and perceived duration. The present study aimed at investigating whether the effects of chronic stimulant use on temporal processing are time-interval dependent. All participants performed two different time bisection tasks (480/1920 ms and 1200/2640 ms) in which we analysed the proportion of long responses for each stimulus duration as well as an index of perceived duration and one of sensitivity. Regarding the proportion of long responses, we found no differences between groups in either time bisection task but patients had more variable results than controls did in both tasks. This study provides new insight into temporal processing in stimulant-dependent patients. Regardless of the time interval tested, the results showed comparable temporal ability in patients and controls, but higher temporal variability in patients. This finding is consistent with impairment of frontally-mediated cognitive functions involved in time perception rather than impairment in time processing per se.</p>

	<p>In recent years, evidence has been provided that individuals with dyslexia show alterations in the anatomy and function of the auditory cortex. Dyslexia is considered to be a learning disability that affects the development of music and language capacity. We set out to test adolescents and young adults with dyslexia and controls (N = 52) for their neurophysiological differences by investigating the auditory evoked P1&amp;amp;ndash;N1&amp;amp;ndash;P2 complex. In addition, we assessed their ability in Mandarin, in singing, their musical talent and their individual differences in elementary auditory skills. A discriminant analysis of magnetencephalography (MEG) revealed that individuals with dyslexia showed prolonged latencies in P1, N1, and P2 responses. A correlational analysis between MEG and behavioral variables revealed that Mandarin syllable tone recognition, singing ability and musical aptitude (AMMA) correlated with P1, N1, and P2 latencies, respectively, while Mandarin pronunciation was only associated with N1 latency. The main findings of this study indicate that the earlier P1, N1, and P2 latencies, the better is the singing, the musical aptitude, and the ability to link Mandarin syllable tones to their corresponding syllables. We suggest that this study provides additional evidence that dyslexia can be understood as an auditory and sensory processing deficit.</p>

	<p>Establishing expressive language benchmarks (ELBs) for children with Down syndrome (DS), as developed by Tager-Flusberg et al. for children with autism, is critically needed to inform the development of novel treatments, identify individualized treatment targets, and promote accurate monitoring of progress. In the present study, we assessed ELB assignments in three language domains (phonology, vocabulary, and grammar) for 53 young children with DS (CA range: 2.50&amp;amp;ndash;7.99 years) using standardized assessments. The participants were classified into one of four ELB levels (preverbal, first words, word combinations, and sentences) in each language domain. Associations with additional measures of language, chronological age, nonverbal cognition, and verbal short-term memory were considered. Analyses of individual ELB profiles indicated substantial variability across the three language domains, with six different patterns of variation across domains emerging. At the same time, the ELB categories were significantly associated with independent language measures and broader developmental domains. Moreover, ELB changes were observed in a small sample of children with DS reassessed 18&amp;amp;ndash;24 months after the initial visit. Results from the present study suggest the procedures outlined by Tager-Flusberg et al. for defining ELBs are a potentially useful tool for describing the language abilities of children with DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normative values of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI signal in older adults obtained using a standard protocol for acquisition and analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: The integrity and function of catecholamine neurotransmitter systems can be assessed using MRI sequences often referred to as neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI). The relevance of this method to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders is becoming increasingly evident, and it has potential as a clinical biomarker. To support such future applications, we report here the normative range of NM-MRI signal and volume metrics in cognitively normal older adults. Methods: 3 Tesla NM-MRI images and demographic and cognitive data were available from 152 cognitively normal older adults aged 53-86 years old at baseline; a subsample of 68 participants also had follow-up NM-MRI data collected around one-year later. NM-MRI images were processed to yield summary measures of volume and signal (contrast-to-noise ratio, CNR) for the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) using a recently developed software employing a fully automated algorithm. The extent of annual change in these metrics was quantified and tested for significance using 1-sample t-tests. Results: Baseline SN signal (CNR) was 10.02% (left SN) and 10.28% (right) and baseline LC signal was 24.71% (left) and 20.42% (right). The only NM-MRI metric to show a significant annual change was a decrease in left SN volume. Conclusion: We report normative values for NM-MRI signal and volume in the SN and LC of cognitively normal older adults and normative values for their change over time. These values may help future efforts to use NM-MRI as a clinical biomarker for adults in this age range by facilitating identification of patients with extreme NM-MRI values.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tactile attention modulates occipital alpha oscillations in early blindness</a></h4>

              
                Alpha oscillatory activity is thought to contribute to the cueing of visual attention through the engagement of task-relevant occipital regions. In early blindness, occipital alpha oscillations are systematically reduced, suggesting that occipital alpha depends on visual experience. However, it is still unknown if alpha activity could serve attentional cueing in non-visual modalities in blind people, especially considering previous research that showed the recruitment of the occipital cortex for non-visual processing. To test this idea, we used electroencephalography to answer whether alpha oscillations reflected a differential recruitment of task-relevant regions between expected and unexpected conditions in two (texture and shape discrimination) haptic tasks. As expected, time frequency analyses showed that alpha suppression in parieto-occipital sites was significantly reduced in early blind individuals. The source reconstruction analysis revealed that group differences originated in the middle occipital cortex. In that region, expected trials evoked higher alpha desynchronization than unexpected trials in the EB group only. Our results support the role of alpha rhythms in the recruitment of occipital areas also in early blind participants, and for the first time we show that even if posterior alpha activity is reduced in blindness, it is however sensitive to task-dependent factors. Our findings therefore suggest that occipital alpha activity may be involved in tactile attention in blind individuals, maintaining the function proposed for visual attention in sighted population but switched to the tactile modality. Altogether, our results indicate that attention-dependent modulation of alpha oscillatory activity does not depend on visual experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute stress impairs sensorimotor gating via the neurosteroid allopregnanolone in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background and purposeAmple evidence indicates that environmental stress impairs information processing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain partially elusive. We showed that, in several rodent models of psychopathology, the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) reduces the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle, a well-validated index of sensorimotor gating. Since this GABAA receptor activator is synthesized in response to acute stress, we hypothesized its participation in stress-induced PPI deficits.

Experimental approachWe studied whether and how AP influences PPI in mice and rats; thereafter, we tested APs implication in the PPI deficits produced by several complementary regimens of acute and short-term stress (footshock, restraint, predator exposure, and sleep deprivation).

Key resultsSystemic AP administration reduced PPI in C57BL/6J mice and Long-Evans, but not Sprague-Dawley, rats. These effects were reversed by isoallopregnanolone (isoAP), an endogenous AP antagonist, and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline and mimicked by AP infusions in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). PPI was reduced by acute footshock, sleep deprivation as well as the combination of restraint and predator exposure in a time- and intensity-dependent fashion. Acute stress increased AP concentrations in the mPFC, and its detrimental effects on PPI were countered by systemic and intra-mPFC administration of isoAP.

Conclusions and implicationsThese results collectively indicate that acute stress impairs PPI by increasing AP content in the mPFC. The confirmation of these mechanisms across distinct animal models and several acute stressors strongly supports the translational value of these findings and warrants future research on the role of AP in information processing.

                Human microglia play a pivotal role in neurological diseases, but few targeted therapies that directly modulate microglial state or function exist due to an incomplete understanding of microglial heterogeneity. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile live human microglia from autopsies or surgical resections across diverse neurological diseases and central nervous system regions. We observe a central divide between oxidative and heterocyclic metabolism and identify subsets associated with antigen presentation, motility, and proliferation. Specific subsets are enriched in susceptibility genes for neurodegenerative diseases or the disease-associated microglial signature. We validate subtypes in situ with an RNAscope-immunofluorescence pipeline and leverage our dataset as a classification resource, finding that iPSC model systems recapitulate substantial in vivo heterogeneity. Finally, we identify and validate candidates for chemically inducing subtype-specific states in vitro, showing that Camptothecin downregulates the transcriptional signature of disease-enriched subsets and upregulates a signature previously shown to be depleted in Alzheimers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep state-dependent modulations of hippocampal theta oscillations and sharp wave-ripples by pontine waves</a></h4>

              
                Ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) or pontine (P) waves are a prominent electrophysiological marker of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Although P-waves have long been recognized, they have been less studied compared to other sleep-related neural events. Recent studies in mice and macaques uncovered state-dependent functional coupling of P-waves with hippocampal oscillations, including sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) during non-REM (NREM) sleep and theta oscillations during REM sleep. However, the detailed characteristic of this functional coupling remains unclear. In addition, since P-waves in mice have been reported rarely, it is also important to describe their detailed electrophysiological properties, given the importance of the animal model. Here, we address these issues by performing multiple types of electrophysiological recordings in mice. P-waves characterized by diverse brainstem firing appear more frequently during REM sleep, and in both hemispheres at the same time across sleep states. The P-wave frequency can also predict the duration of REM sleep episodes. While P-waves induce modulated hippocampal excitability and phase coupling with theta oscillations during REM sleep, surprisingly P-waves lead to shorter SWRs during NREM sleep. These results suggest that P-waves play a role in systems memory consolidation by functionally coupling with hippocampal ensembles in a state-dependent fashion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sticker-and-Linker Model for Amyloid BetaCondensation and Fibrillation</a></h4>

              
                A major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of neurotoxic plaques composed of amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptides in patients' brains. The pathway of plaque formation remains elusive, though some clues appear to lie in the dominant presence of A{beta}1-42 in these plaques despite A{beta}1-40 making up approximately 90% of the A{beta} pool. We hypothesise that this asymmetry is driven by the hydrophobicity of the two extra amino acids that are incorporated in A{beta}1-42. To investigate this hypothesis at the level of single molecules, we have developed a molecular 'sticker-and-linker lattice model' of unfolded A{beta}. The model protein has a single sticker that may reversibly dimerise and elongate into semi-flexible linear oligomers. The growth is hampered by excluded-volume interactions that are encoded by the hydrophilic linkers but are rendered cooperative by the attractive interactions of hydrophobic linkers. For sufficiently strong hydrophobicity, the chains undergo liquid-liquid phase-separation (LLPS) into condensates that facilitate the nucleation of fibres. We find that a small fraction of A{beta}1-40 in a mixture of A{beta}1-40 and A{beta}1-42 shift the critical concentration for LLPS to lower values. This study provides theoretical support for the hypothesis that LLPS condensates act as a precursor for aggregation and provides an explanation for the A{beta}1-42-enrichment of aggregates in terms of hydrophobic interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fatty acid metabolism changes in association with neurobehavioral deficits in animal models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders</a></h4>

              
                Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) show various behavioral problems due to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Our previous study found significant changes in gene expressions linked to fatty acid metabolism in the brain of the PAE mouse model. Given the importance of fatty acids in normal brain functions and the contributions to neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesized that the fatty acids changed by PAE contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD. This study found an increase of palmitic acid and arachidonic acid in phospholipid compositions in the cerebral cortex of PAE at postnatal day 30. The increase of palmitic acid was consistent with the increase of the producing enzyme, fatty acid synthase (Fasn). The decrease of 26:6 fatty acid was also found in phospholipid. It is consistent with the increase of the Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4) which uses 26:6 as a substrate for making very long chain fatty acids. However, there was no increase in the elongated products. Rather, we found an accumulation of the lipid droplets (LDs) in the PAE brain, suggesting changes in fatty acid metabolism that lead to the accumulation of excessive fatty acids. Although metabolic measurements, including plasma triglyceride level, were not affected by PAE, the abundance of fatty acid-related gut microbiota was altered. Interestingly, multi-omics association analysis revealed a potential contribution of the altered gut microbiota, primarily Ruminococcaceae that produces short chain fatty acid, to LD formation in the PAE brain and the behavioral problems, suggesting that the gut microbiome could serve as a tool to facilitate uncovering the brain pathophysiology of FASD and a potential target to mitigate neurobehavioral problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity fingerprints of the frontal eye fields and inferior frontal junction in the dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the frontal eye field (FEF) and inferior frontal junction (IFJ) govern the encoding of spatial and non-spatial (such as feature- or object-based) representations, respectively, both during visual attention and working memory tasks. However, it is still unclear whether such contrasting functional segregation is also reflected in their underlying functional connectivity patterns. Here, we hypothesized that FEF has predominant functional coupling with spatiotopically organized regions in the dorsal ('where') visual stream, whereas IFJ has predominant functional connectivity with the ventral ('what') visual stream. We applied seed-based functional connectivity analyses to temporally high-resolving resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We parcellated the brain according to the multimodal Glasser atlas and tested, for various frequency bands, whether the spontaneous activity of each parcel in the ventral and dorsal visual pathway has predominant functional connectivity with FEF or IFJ. The results show that FEF has a robust power correlation with the dorsal visual pathway in beta and gamma bands. In contrast, anterior IFJ (IFJa) has a strong power coupling with the ventral visual stream in delta, beta, and gamma oscillations. Moreover, while FEF is directly phase-coupled with the superior parietal lobe in the beta band, IFJa is directly phase-coupled with the middle and inferior temporal cortex in delta and gamma oscillations. We argue that these intrinsic connectivity fingerprints are congruent with each brain region's function. Therefore, we conclude that FEF and IFJ have dissociable connectivity patterns that fit their respective functional roles in spatial vs. non-spatial top-down attention and working memory control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneously cholinergic projection in Ascending and Descending Circuits from Midbrain</a></h4>

              
                The midbrain participates in complex neural information processing in the ascending and descending circuits, but their organization remains unclear due to the lack of comprehensive dissection of the characterization of individual neurons. Combining fluorescent micro-optical sectional tomography with sparse labeling, we acquired the whole-brain dataset with high resolution and reconstructed the detailed morphology of the pontine-tegmental cholinergic neurons (PTCNs). As the main cholinergic system of the midbrain, the individual PTCNs own abundant axons with length up to 60 cm and 5000 terminal branches and innervate multiple brain regions from the spinal cord to cortex in both hemispheres. According to various targeting regions in the ascending and descending circuits, individual PTCNs could be grouped into four types and the axonal fibers of cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus present more divergent while neurons in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus contain richer axonal fibers and dendrites. In the axonal targeting nuclei, such as in the thalamus or cortex, the individual neurons innervate multiple sub-regions with separate pathways. These results provide the detailed organization characterization of the cholinergic neurons to understand the connection logic of the midbrain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal effects of prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation on dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: 10-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to increase dopaminergic activity in the dorsal striatum, a region strongly implicated in reinforcement learning. However, the behavioural influence of this effect remains largely unknown. Objective: Here, we tested the causal effects of rTMS on behavioral and computational characteristics of reinforcement learning. Methods: 40 healthy individuals were randomized into Active and Sham rTMS groups. Each participant underwent one 10-Hz rTMS session (1500 pulses) in which stimulation was applied over the left DLPFC using a robotic arm. Participants then completed a reinforcement learning task sensitive to striatal dopamine functioning. Participants trial-to-trial training choices were modelled using a reinforcement learning model (Q-learning) that calculates separate learning rates associated with positive and negative reward prediction errors. Results: Subjects receiving Active TMS exhibited an increased reward rate (number of correct responses per second of task activity) compared to the Sham rTMS group. Computationally, the Active rTMS group displayed a higher learning rate for correct trials (G) compared to incorrect trials (L). Finally, when tested with novel pairs of stimuli, the Active group displayed extremely fast reaction times, and a trend towards a higher reward rate. Conclusions: The present study provided specific behavioral and computational accounts of altered striatal-mediated reinforcement learning induced by a proposed increase of dopamine activity by 10-Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC. Together, these findings bolster the use of TMS to target neurocognitive disturbances attributed to the dysregulation of dopaminergic-striatal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated real-time EEG sleep spindle detection for brain state-dependent brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are a hallmark electroencephalographic (EEG) feature of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and believed to be instrumental for sleep-dependent memory reactivation and consolidation. However, direct proof of their causal relevance is hard to obtain, and our understanding of their immediate neurophysiological consequences is limited. To investigate their causal role, spindles need to be targeted in real-time with sensory or non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. While fully automated offline detection algorithms are well established, spindle detection in real time is highly challenging due to their spontaneous and transient nature. Here, we present the real-time spindle detector (RTSD), a robust multi-channel EEG signal processing algorithm that enables the automated triggering of stimulation during sleep spindles in a phase-specific manner. We validated the RTSD method by streaming pre-recorded sleep EEG datasets to a real-time computer system running a Simulink Real-Time implementation of the algorithm. Sleep spindles were detected with high levels of sensitivity (~83%) and precision (~78%) and an F1-score of ~0.81 in reference to state-of-the-art offline algorithms (which reached similar levels when compared to each other), for both naps and full nights, and largely independent of sleep scoring information. Detected spindles were comparable in frequency, duration, amplitude, and symmetry, and showed the typical time-frequency characteristics as well as a centroparietal topography. Spindles were detected close to their center and reliably at the predefined target phase. The RTSD algorithm therefore empowers researchers to target spindles during human sleep and apply the stimulation method and experimental paradigm of their choice.

                A growing number of social interactions are taking place virtually on video conferencing platforms. Here, we explore potential effects of virtual interactions on observed behavior, subjective experience, and neural "single-brain" and "inter-brain" activity via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. We scanned a total of 72 participants (36 dyads) who engaged with their partner in three naturalistic tasks (i.e., problem-solving, creative-innovation, socio-emotional task), in either an in-person or virtual (Zoom) condition. We also coded cooperative behavior from audio recordings. We found increased and sustained prefrontal activation in the virtual condition, potentially providing a neural basis of "Zoom fatigue". We also observed reduced behavioral cooperation (i.e., conversational turn-taking), and altered patterns of averaged and dynamic inter-brain coherence, in virtual interactions. Inter-brain coherence patterns that were characteristic of the virtual condition were associated with reduced behavioral cooperation. These insights can inform the design and engineering of the next generation of video conferencing technology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related hearing loss alters real-time dynamics of auditory cortical-brainstem coding during speech perception</a></h4>

              
                Realtime modulation of brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) by online changes in cortical arousal state via the corticofugal (top-down) pathway has been demonstrated previously in younger humans and is more prominent in the presence of background noise. FFRs during high cortical arousal states also have a stronger relationship with speech behaviors. Aging is associated with overexaggerated auditory responses, which might reflect degraded inhibitory processing within the peripheral and ascending pathways, or changes in attentional control regulation via descending auditory pathways. Here, we tested the hypothesis that online corticofugal interplay is impacted in age-related hearing loss. We measured EEG in older adults with normal-hearing (NH) and hearing-loss (HL) while they actively performed speech identification tasks in different noise backgrounds. We measured  power to index online arousal states during task engagement and separate speech-FFRs according to fluctuations in cortical activity. We found cortical  power was smaller in the HL than NH group. In NH listeners, -FFRs modulation for clear speech also resembled that previously observed in noise among younger adults. Cortical-brainstem modulation was further diminished by noise and with HL in older adults. Lastly, neural decoding showed low- FFRs were more predictive of behavioral measures and carried more stimulus-related information of speech in NH individuals. Our findings provide evidence that age-related hearing loss affects cortical-brainstem interplay in the auditory system. Aberrant modulation of brainstem speech processing exposes a new underlying mechanism for the listening difficulties faced by older adults when engaging in cocktail party-like conversations.

                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that regulates several aspects of brain function. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the expression and function of BDNF in neurons, its expression in microglia remains controversial. Using a combination of genetic tools and fluorescence imaging, we analyzed BDNF expression pattern and interrogated the effect of microglial BDNF deletion on neuronal activity, early-stage spine formation, and microglia-neuron interactions in the motor cortex. Our results suggest that microglia do not express BDNF in sufficient amounts to modulate neuronal function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">QuNex -- An Integrative Platform forReproducible Neuroimaging Analytics</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging technology has experienced explosive growth and has transformed the study of neural mechanisms across health and disease. However, given the diversity of sophisticated tools for handling neuroimaging data, the field faces challenges around method integration (1-3). Specifically, researchers often have to rely on siloed approaches which limit reproducibility, with idiosyncratic data organization and limited software interoperability. To address these challenges, we developed Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & Toolbox (QuNex), a platform for consistent end-to-end processing and analytics. QuNex is engineered for reproducible deployment of custom workflows, from onboarding raw data to generating analytic features, in a single "turnkey" command. The platform enables inter-operable integration of multi-modal, community-developed neuroimaging software through an extension framework with a software development kit for seamless integration of community tools. Critically, it supports high-throughput, parallel processing in high-performance compute environments, either locally or in the cloud. Notably, QuNex has successfully processed over 10,000 scans across neuroimaging consortia (4), including multiple clinical datasets. Moreover, QuNex enables integration of non-human primate, rodent, and human workflows via a cohesive translational platform. Collectively, this effort stands to significantly impact neuroimaging method integration across acquisition approaches, pipelines, datasets, computational environments, and species. Building on this platform will enable more rapid, scalable, and reproducible impact of neuroimaging technology across health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bumetanide increases microglia-interneuron contact following traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) inhibitor bumetanide has prominent positive effects on the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders. Here we studied whether bumetanide could influence post-traumatic cognitive decline and inflammatory processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation. Method: Controlled cortical impacted (CCI) animals were treated with bumetanide during the first post-CCI week. Immunochemistry, flow cytometry, immunoassay, and in vivo imaging were used to study astrocytic and microglial morphology and phenotype as well as adult neurogenesis. Telemetric electroencephalograms and cognitive behavioral test were performed at one-month post CCI. Results: Bumetanide prevented CCI-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and parvalbumin positive interneuron loss. Deletion of NKCC1 in astrocytes neither rescued interneurons nor promote neurogenesis. Interestingly, bumetanide had a strong effect on microglial activation by inducing polarization towards the M1-like phenotype 3 days post-CCI and the M2-like phenotype 7 days post-CCI. Bumetanide increased microglial Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and interaction with parvalbumin interneurons. The early treatment with bumetanide resulted in improvements in working and episodic memory, one-month post-CCI, as well as the normalization of theta band oscillations. Interpretation: Here, we disclose a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective action of bumetanide mediated by an acceleration of microglial activation dynamics that leads to an increase of parvalbumin interneuron survival following CCI, possibly resulting from increased microglial BDNF expression and contact with interneurons. Salvage of interneurons may normalize ambient gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulting in the preservation of adult neurogenesis processes as well as contributing to bumetanide-mediated improvement of cognitive performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population geometry enables fast sampling in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                For animals to navigate an uncertain world, their brains need to estimate uncertainty at the timescales of sensations and actions. Sampling-based algorithms afford a theoretically-grounded framework for probabilistic inference in neural circuits, but it remains unknown how one can implement fast sampling algorithms in biologically-plausible spiking networks. Here, we propose to leverage the population geometry, controlled by the neural code and the neural dynamics, to implement fast samplers in spiking neural networks. We first show that that two classes of spiking samplers--efficient balanced spiking networks that simulate Langevin sampling, and networks with probabilistic spike rules that implement Metropolis-Hastings sampling--can be unified within a common framework. We then show that careful choice of population geometry enables rapid inference of parameters drawn from strongly-correlated high-dimensional distributions in both networks. Our results suggest design principles for algorithms for sampling-based probabilistic inference in spiking neural networks, yielding potential inspiration for neuromorphic computing and testable predictions for neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Operative dimensions in unconstrained connectivity of recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are commonly used models to study neural computation. However, a comprehensive understanding of how dynamics in RNN emerge from the underlying connectivity is largely lacking. Previous work derived such an understanding for RNN fulfilling very specific constraints on their connectivity, but it is unclear whether the resulting insights apply more generally. Here we study how network dynamics are related to network connectivity in RNN trained without any specific constraints on several tasks previously employed in neuroscience. Despite the apparent high-dimensional connectivity of these RNN, we show that a low-dimensional, functionally relevant subspace of the weight matrix can be found through the identification of operative dimensions, which we define as components of the connectivity whose removal has a large influence on local RNN dynamics. We find that a weight matrix built from only a few operative dimensions is sufficient for the RNN to operate with the original performance, implying that much of the high-dimensional structure of the trained connectivity is functionally irrelevant. The existence of a low-dimensional, operative subspace in the weight matrix simplifies the challenge of linking connectivity to network dynamics and suggests that independent network functions may be placed in specific, separate subspaces of the weight matrix to avoid catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.

	<p>Background: Motor inhibition is a complex cognitive function regulated by specific brain regions and influenced by the activity of the Central Autonomic Network. We investigate the two-way Brain&amp;amp;ndash;Heart interaction during a Go/NoGo task. Spectral EEG &amp;amp;thetasym;, &amp;amp;alpha; powerbands, and HRV parameters (Complexity Index (CI), Low Frequency (LF) and High Frequency (HF) powers) were recorded. Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers were enrolled. We used a modified version of the classical Go/NoGo task, based on Rule Shift Cards, characterized by a baseline and two different tasks of different complexity. The participants were divided into subjects with Good (GP) and Poor (PP) performances. Results: In the baseline, CI was negatively correlated with &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. In task 1, the CI was negatively correlated with the errors and &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;, while the errors were positively correlated with &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. In task 2, CI was negatively correlated with the Reaction Time and positively with &amp;amp;alpha;, and the errors were negatively correlated with the Reaction Time and positively correlated with &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. The GP group showed, at baseline, a negative correlation between CI and &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;thetasym;. Conclusions: We provide a new combined Brain&amp;amp;ndash;Heart model underlying inhibitory control abilities. The results are consistent with the complementary role of &amp;amp;alpha; and &amp;amp;thetasym; oscillations in cognitive control.</p>

	<p>The meningeal lymphatic, or glymphatic, system is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community. Recent work includes noninvasive techniques to demonstrate relationships between blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) activity and the glymphatic system in the human central nervous system. One potential technique is the use of music/sound to enhance BBB permeability regarding the movement of small molecules in and out of the brain. However, there is minimal knowledge regarding the methodical investigation(s) of the uses of music/sound on BBB permeability and glymphatic clearance and the outcomes of these investigation(s). This review contains evidence discussing relationships between music/sound, BBB permeability, and meningeal lymphatic clearance. An overview of the anatomy and physiology of the system is presented. We discuss the uses of music/sound to modulate brain and body functions, highlighting music&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on mood and autonomic, cognitive, and neuronal function. We also propose implications for follow-up work. The results showed that music and sound interventions do, in fact, contribute to the opening of the BBB and subsequently increase the function of the meningeal lymphatic system. Evidence also suggests that music/sound has the ability to reduce the collateral effects of brain injuries. Unfortunately, music/sound is rarely used in the clinical setting as a medical intervention. Still, recent research shows the potential positive impacts that music/sound could have on various organ systems.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to capture subjective daily functional cognitive decline among patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Participants (40&amp;amp;ndash;79 y; 78 with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and 41 healthy matched controls) completed the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Cognitive Functional Rating Scale (CFRS), Daily Living Questionnaire (DLQ), and Time Organisation and Participation Scale (TOPS) questionnaires. Patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease were divided into groups with or without suspected mild cognitive decline according to their scores on the Cognitive Functional (CF) feature, which is based on certain items of the MDS-UPDRS. Significant between-group differences were found in the DLQ and TOPS scores. Significant correlations were found among the questionnaire results, with specific DLQ and TOPS items accounting for 35% of the variance in the CF feature, which correlated with daily cognitive functional states. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results are relevant for detecting subtle deficits in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease patients suspected of mild cognitive decline, which can affect health and quality of life and relates to risk for later dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal recruitment of inhibition and excitation in the mammalian cortex during electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation has emerged as a powerful and precise treatment in which to modulate aberrant neural activity patterns common in neural dysfunction and disease; however, the physiological process involved in microstimulation is poorly understood, particularly regarding the contributions of inhibitory neurons to shaping stimulation-evoked activity. To address this issue, we used 2-photon imaging of transgenic mice to measure the widespread responses of inhibitory and excitatory neurons to electrical stimulation through a chronically-implanted cortical microelectrode. We found that increasing stimulation amplitude both raised the fraction of neurons that responded to a stimulus and increased the distance at which inhibitory and excitatory neurons were significantly modulated by stimulation; however, the lateral spread of inhibitory activity preceded that of excitatory activity. By 50 micro-Amps, a significantly larger fraction of inhibitory neurons vs. excitatory neurons were modulated by stimulation. Increasing amplitude also shifted the temporal response properties of the population --- towards longer-latency excitation close to the electrode tip and strong inhibition of more distant neurons. Animal behavior, specifically their locomotion patterns, strongly correlated with trial-to-trial variability in stimulation evoked responses. We conclude that changing electrical stimulation amplitude can shift the balance of excitation to inhibition in the brain in a manner that interact with ongoing animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical closed-loop voltage clamp for precise control of muscles and neurons in live animals</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetics are used to stimulate or inhibit neurons. Because optogenetic stimulation is typically static, neurons and circuits can quickly adapt, allowing perturbation, but not true control. To overcome this, we established an optogenetic voltage-clamp (OVC). The genetically encoded voltage-indicator QuasAr2 provides information for fast, closed-loop optical feedback to the bidirectional optogenetic actuator BiPOLES. Voltage-dependent fluorescence is held within tight margins, thus clamping the cell at a distinct potential. We established the OVC in muscles and neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans, and transferred it to hippocampal neurons in rat brain slices. We calibrated fluorescence signals to electrically measured membrane potentials, showed that the OVC reports on homeostatically altered cellular physiology in mutants affecting neurotransmission, and that it can dynamically clamp spiking. The OVC combines non-invasive imaging with the control capabilities of electrophysiology. Its applicability to individual cells facilitates high-throughput contact-less electrophysiology and paves the way for true optogenetic control in behaving animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in Auditory, Static, and Dynamic Imbalance Behaviors: Implications for Vestibular Migraine</a></h4>

              
                About 42% of people with migraine have a vestibular component causing balance problems and dizziness. In fact, VM is a major cause of vertigo in dizziness clinics and is estimated to affect 1% of the overall population. As migraine increases light, and sound sensitivities, it also increases sensitivities to movement or perceived movement in VM. Patients with migraine, and especially VM, exhibit a heightened sense of sound, or phonophobia. Phonophobia is also related to hyperacusis (extreme sensitivity to sound). Behavioral evidence of hyperacusis and phonophobia in mice can be inferred using the acoustic startle reflex (ASR). The most common symptoms of VM were unsteadiness, balance disturbances, and light headedness. When balance disturbances were quantified, VM patients swayed more than migraine-only or healthy controls, when challenged with competing stimulus. In addition to static imbalance, VM patients also showed dynamic imbalances such as gait disturbances. In this study, we tested wildtype C57B6/J mice to determine if mice exhibited increased sound (measured by acoustic startle), static imbalance (measured by postural sway), and dynamic imbalance (measured by rotarod), when challenged with systemic CGRP (IP) 0.1 mg/kg. We found both sexes of mice were affected by systemic CGRP in sound and dynamic imbalance testing, yet only female mice showed increased postural sway after systemic CGRP, recapitulating the higher incidence of VM in females. These non-invasive assays of VM pave the way to further explore mechanisms of CGRP signaling in VM, and test effectiveness of migraine therapeutics in VM.

                Migraine and vestibular migraine (VM) are associated with enhanced motion sensitivity, and VM is the most common cause of spontaneous vertigo but remains poorly understood. It is now accepted that migraine involves the neuropeptide Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP); yet it is not clear if CGRP signaling or its antagonism is involved in motion sensitivity of VM symptoms. Recent murine models of migraine used injections of CGRP or other migraine triggers (sodium nitroprusside SNP) to induce migraine sensitivities, yet it is not known if these triggers can induce VM sensitivities. Moreover, it is not known if migraine blockers used in preclinical migraine models, can also block the motion-sensitivity of VM. To better understand CGRP signallingin VM motion sensitivity, we investigated two measures of motion sickness assessment (MSI scoring and motion-induced thermoregulation) after systemic injections of either CGRP or SNP in the wildtype C57B6/J mice, and found that MSI measures were confounded by CGRPs effect on based on gastric distress, yet assessing motion sensitivity using thermoregulation was robust for both migraine triggers, and CGRP receptor antagonism by olcegepant, but not triptan treatments, rescued CGRPs effect on increased motion sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of non-human primate dura in health and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Brain meninges and associated vasculature participate in brain clearance and are implicated in many neurological conditions such as Alzheimers disease, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. However, most of our knowledge concerning brain clearance via meninges is based on rodent data, and relevance to human disease remains unclear. One of the technical barriers in studies of meningeal physiology in health and disease is that existing imaging modalities are suboptimal for large and optically non-transparent meningeal tissue of humans and non-human primate (NHP) animal models. To address this barrier, we performed first characterization of NHP dura by high resolution confocal microscopy of clarified tissue. We investigated vascular structures and resident cells in normal monkeys and primate models of tauopathy and synucleinopathy. We demonstrated the presence of an extensive meningeal vascular network covering the entire tissue surface with resolution to the smallest capillaries. This is also the first work to map lymphatic vessels in the dura of non-human primate (NHP). Overall, the NHP lymphatic meningeal system resembles the anatomy found in rat dura, but it is more complex. Analysis of dura from NPH models of tauopathy and synucleinopathy revealed an association with disease-specific biomarkers (amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein) with both the blood and lymphatic vasculature. This work has broad relevance to many brain diseases where solute accumulation and abnormal macromolecular clearance is a part of the pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the role of Ca2+ fluxes in defining fast and slow components of spontaneous Ca2+ local transients in OPCs using computational modeling</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous Ca2+ local transients (SCaLTs) in isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are largely regulated by the following fluxes: store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX), Ca2+ pumping through Ca2+-ATPases, and Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release through Ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol-triphosphate receptors (IP3R). However, the relative contributions of these fluxes in mediating fast spiking and slow baseline oscillations seen in SCaLTs remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed a stochastic spatiotemporal computational model to simulate SCaLTs in a homogeneous medium with ion flow between the extracellular, cytoplasmic and endoplasmicreticulum compartments. By simulating the model and plotting both the histograms of SCaLTs obtained experimentally and from the model as well as the standard deviation of interspike intervals (ISI) against ISI averages of multiple model and experimental realizations we revealed that: SCaLTs exhibit very similar characteristics between the two datasets, they are mostly random, they encode information in their frequency, and the slow baseline oscillations could be due to the stochastic slow clustering of IP3R (modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process). Bifurcation analysis of a deterministic temporal version of the model shows that the contribution of fluxes to SCaLTs depends on the parameter regime and that the combination of excitability, stochasticity, and mixedmode oscillations are responsible for irregular spiking and doublets in SCaLTs. Additionally, our results demonstrate that blocking each flux reduces SCaLTs frequency and that the reverse (forward) mode of NCX decreases (increases) SCaLTs. Taken together, these results provide a quantitative framework for SCaLT formation in OPCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of a Translational Murine Model of Closed-head Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) from closed-head trauma is a leading cause of disability with limited efficacious treatments. Modeling closed-head TBI remains challenging due to applying forces through the intact skull. We systematically investigated sources of variability in a murine model of closed-head TBI and developed a framework to reduce variability across severity and sex. We manipulated gas pressure, dwell time, and displacement to determine effects on vestibulomotor performance, spatial learning, and neuronal damage in 10-week-old male and female mice. Increasing gas pressure beyond 70psi had a ceiling effect on cellular and behavioral outcomes, while manipulating dwell time only affected behavioral performance. Increasing displacement precisely graded injury severity in both sexes across all outcomes. Physical signs of trauma occurred more frequently at higher displacements. Females performed worse than males when injured at 2.7mm displacement and had greater mortality at higher displacements. Stratifying severity based on day-1 rotarod performance retained cellular injury relationships and separated both sexes into cohorts with distinct behavioral recovery. Within-group rotarod variability over 6 days post-injury was reduced by approximately 50%. These results have important implications for translational research in TBI and provide a framework for using this clinically relevant translational injury model in both male and female mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lysosomal dysfunction in Down Syndrome and Alzheimer mouse models is caused by selective v-ATPase inhibition by Tyr682 phosphorylated APP βCTF</a></h4>

              
                Lysosomal dysfunction arises early and propels Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Herein, we show that amyloid precursor protein (APP), linked to early-onset AD in Down Syndrome (DS), acts directly via its {beta}-C-terminal fragment ({beta}CTF) to disrupt lysosomal v-ATPase and acidification. In human DS fibroblasts or brains of DS model mice, the phosphorylated 682YENPTY internalization motif of APP-{beta}CTF binds selectively within a pocket of the v-ATPase V0a1 submit cytoplasmic domain and competitively inhibits its association with the V1 subcomplex of v-ATPase. Inhibiting FYN, a mediator of APP Tyr682 phosphorylation which is over-active in AD and DS, restores normal v-ATPase and lysosome function in DS fibroblasts and DS model mice. Notably, lowering APP-{beta}CTF or APP Tyr682 phosphorylation below normal baseline levels boosts v-ATPase assembly and acidification, suggesting that v-ATPase may also be modulated tonically by phospho-APP-{beta}CTF. These findings offer insight into pathogenic mechanisms also relevant to late onset AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An integrated approach to evaluate the functional effects of disease-associated NMDA receptor variants</a></h4>

              
                The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a ubiquitously expressed glutamate-gated ion channel that plays key roles in brain development and function. Not surprisingly, a variety of disease-associated variants have been identified in genes encoding NMDAR subunits. A critical first step to assess whether these variants contribute to their associated disorder is to characterize their effect on receptor function. However, the complexity of NMDAR function makes this challenging, with most variants typically altering multiple functional properties. At synapses, NMDARs encode presynaptic activity to carry a charge transfer that alters membrane excitability and a Ca2+ influx that has both short- and long-term signaling actions. Here, we characterized epilepsy-associated variants in GluN1 and GluN2A subunits with various phenotypic severity. To capture the dynamics of NMDAR encoding, we applied 10 glutamate pulses at 10 Hz to derive a charge integral. This encoding assay is advantageous since it incorporates multiple gating parameters, activation, deactivation, and desensitization, into a single value. We then integrated this encoding with Mg2+ block and Ca2+ influx using fractional Ca2+ currents to generate indices of charge transfer and Ca2+ transfer over wide voltage ranges. This approach yields consolidated parameters that can be used as a reference to normalize allosteric modulation and has the potential to speed up future bench to bedside methods of investigating variants to determine patient treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Over-expression of thyroid hormone receptor β2 in zebrafish changes the distribution of cone spectral signals</a></h4>

              
                Thyroid hormone receptor {beta}2 (tr{beta}2), a splice variant of thyroxin receptor {beta}, is a transcription factor/nuclear receptor selectively expressed in vertebrate long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS/red) retinal cones and essential for LWS cone development. Using two gain-of-function zebrafish transgenics, we examine the physiological and morphological impact of excess tr{beta}2 in zebrafish cone specification. The crx:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2 transgenic expresses tr{beta}2 early, in retinal progenitors, while gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2;mpv17-/- expresses tr{beta}2 later, in differentiated cone cells. Here electroretinographic signals are isolated from cones by synaptic blockade and the cone spectral composition analyzed. In 5-day crx:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2 embryos, UV- and blue-cone signals are attenuated while LWS2 (larval red-cone opsin) amplitudes increase. 5-day gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2;mpv17-/- spectra are indistinguishable from controls but LWS2 signals surpass controls during later embryonic and juvenile stages. By adulthood, both transgenics become entirely, or almost entirely, red cone dichromats, with LWS1 (adult red-cone opsin) amplitudes becoming super-normal, exceeding adult LWS2 signals, which are unchanged. Adult control LWS1 and LWS2 signal amplitudes are about equal. There are mixed opsin cones in both transgenic larvae. In gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr{beta}2;mpv17-/-, mixed UV- red- opsin immunoreactive cones, a reporter for the UV opsin gene is suppressed, suggesting a UV-to-red cone transformation process. Larval cones with gain-of-function transgenes are morphologically distinct from red, blue or UV cones, with wider inner segments and shorter axons than red cones, suggesting both cone spectral specification and shape are influenced by tr{beta}2.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-invasive auditory brainstem responses to FM sweeps in awake big brown bats</a></h4>

              
                We introduce two EEG techniques, one based on conventional monopolar electrodes and one based on a novel tripolar electrode, to record for the first time auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from the scalp of unanesthetized, unrestrained big brown bats. Stimuli were frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps varying in sweep direction, sweep duration, and harmonic structure. As expected from previous invasive ABR recordings, upward-sweeping FM signals evoked larger amplitude responses (peak-to-trough amplitude in the latency range of 3-5 ms post-stimulus onset) than downward-sweeping FM signals. Scalp-recorded responses displayed amplitude-latency trading effects as expected from invasive recordings. These two findings validate the reliability of our noninvasive recording techniques. The feasibility of recording noninvasively in unanesthetized, unrestrained bats will energize future research uncovering electrophysological signatures of perceptual and cognitive processing of biosonar signals in these animals, and allows for better comparison with ABR data from echolocating cetaceans, where invasive experiments are heavily restricted. Because experiments can be repeated in the same animal over time without confounds of stress or anesthesia, our technique requires fewer captures of wild bats, thus helping to preserve natural populations and addressing the goal of reducing animal numbers used for research purposes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extrinsic control of the early postnatal CA1 hippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                The adult CA1 region of the hippocampus produces coordinated neuronal dynamics with minimal reliance on its extrinsic inputs. In contrast, the neonatal CA1 is tightly linked to externally-generated sensorimotor activity but the circuit mechanisms underlying early synchronous activity in CA1 remain unclear. Here, using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo circuit mapping, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings in mouse pups, we show that early dynamics in the ventro-intermediate CA1 are under the mixed influence of entorhinal (EC) and thalamic (VMT) inputs. Both VMT and EC can drive internally-generated synchronous events ex vivo. However, movement-related population bursts detected in vivo are exclusively driven by the EC. These differential effects on synchrony reflect the different intrahippocampal targets of these inputs. Hence, cortical and subcortical pathways act differently on the neonatal CA1, implying distinct contributions to the development of the hippocampal microcircuit and related cognitive maps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of structural features of selected flavonoids responsible for neuroprotection using a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Nature-derived bioactive compounds have emerged as promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of diverse chronic illnesses, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying their neuroprotective effects remain unclear. Most studies focus solely on the antioxidant activities of natural products which translate to poor outcome in clinical trials. Current therapies against neurodegeneration only provide symptomatic relief thereby underscoring the need for novel strategies to combat disease onset and progression. We have employed an environmental toxin-induced Drosophila Parkinson's disease (PD) model as an inexpensive in vivo screening platform to explore neuroprotective potential of selected dietary flavonoids. We have identified a specific group of flavonoids known as flavones displaying protection against paraquat (PQ)-induced neurodegenerative phenotypes, involving reduced survival, mobility defects and enhanced oxidative stress. Interestingly, the other groups of investigated flavonoids, namely, the flavonones and flavonols failed to provide protection indicating a requirement of specific structural features that confer protection against PQ-mediated neurotoxicity in Drosophila. Based on our screen, the neuroprotective flavones lack a functional group substitution at the C3 and contain ,{beta}-unsaturated carbonyl group. Furthermore, flavones-mediated neuroprotection is not solely dependent on antioxidant properties but also involves regulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Our data identify specific structural features of selected flavonoids that provide neuroprotection against environmental toxin-induced PD pathogenesis that can be explored for novel therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feasibility of 3T layer-dependent fMRI with GE-BOLD using NORDIC and phase regression</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Functional MRI with spatial resolution in the submillimeter domain enables measurements of activation across cortical layers in humans. This is valuable as different types of cortical computations, e.g., feedforward versus feedback related activity, take place in different cortical layers. Layer-dependent fMRI (L-fMRI) studies have almost exclusively employed 7T scanners to overcome the reduced signal stability associated with small voxels. However, such systems are relatively rare and only a subset of those are clinically approved. In the present study, we examined the feasibility of L-fMRI at 3T using NORDIC denoising. Methods: 5 healthy subjects were scanned on a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner. To assess across-session reliability, each subject was scanned in 3-8 sessions on 3-4 consecutive days. A 3D gradient echo EPI (GE-EPI) sequence was used for BOLD acquisitions (voxel size 0.82 mm isotopic, TR = 2.2 s) using a block designed finger tapping paradigm. NORDIC denoising was applied to the magnitude and phase time series to overcome limitations in tSNR and the denoised phase time series were subsequently used to correct for large vein contamination through phase regression. Results and conclusion: NORDIC denoising resulted in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) values comparable to or higher than commonly observed at 7T. Layer-dependent activation profiles could thus be extracted robustly, within and across sessions, from regions of interest located in the hand knob of the primary motor cortex (M1). Phase regression led to substantially reduced superficial bias in obtained layer profiles, although residual macrovascular contribution remained. We believe the present results support the feasibility of L-fMRI at 3T, which might help make L-fMRI available to a much wider community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neuroeconomics of individual differences in saccadic decisions</a></h4>

              
                Active exploration of the visual environment requires choosing the next gaze target, which has been characterized as depending on attentional biases and on oculomotor biases. However, disentangling these two factors has provided contradictory results. Here, we conceptualize active gaze selection as a decision-making process in the context of neuroeconomics, allowing us to employ a new saccadic preference elicitation experiment and to quantify behavioral biases with a random utility model. Subjects showed similar preferences for shorter amplitude saccades in line with previous research and shared a preference for saccades back towards the previous gaze location, contrary to numerous reports on spatial "inhibition of return". Surprisingly, the experiment revealed marked individual differences in the preferences for global gaze directions, which were stable across most participants after one week. Thus, this study provides the first measurement of intrinsic saccadic utilities independently of spatial image properties and quantitatively dissociates stable individual differences in global gaze selection.

	<p>Most research analyzed gut-microbiota alterations in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) through cross-sectional studies, as single snapshots, without considering the time factor to either confirm methods and findings or observe longitudinal variations. In this study, we introduce the time factor by comparing gut-microbiota composition in 18 PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC) at baseline and at least 1 year later, also considering PD clinical features. PD patients and HC underwent a fecal sampling at baseline and at a follow-up appointment. Fecal samples underwent sequencing and 16S rRNA amplicons analysis. Patients&amp;amp;rsquo;clinical features were valued through Hoehn&amp;amp;amp;Yahr (H&amp;amp;amp;Y) staging-scale and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part-III. Results demonstrated stability in microbiota findings in both PD patients and HC over a period of 14 months: both alfa and beta diversity were maintained in PD patients and HC over the observation period. In addition, differences in microbiota composition between PD patients and HC remained stable over the time period. Moreover, during the same period, patients did not experience any worsening of either staging or motor impairment. Our findings, highlighting the stability and reproducibility of the method, correlate clinical and microbiota stability over time and open the scenario to more extensive longitudinal evaluations.</p>

	<p>To further understand how consciousness emerges, certain paradigms inducing distractor-induced perceptual impairments are promising. Neuro-computational models explain the inhibition of conscious perception of targets with suppression of distractor information when the target and distractor share the same features. Because these gating mechanisms are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, transcranial direct current stimulation of this specific region is expected to alter distractor-induced effects depending on the presence and number of distractors. To this end, participants were asked to perform an auditory variant of the distractor-induced blindness paradigm under frontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Results show the expected distractor-induced deafness effects in a reduction of target detection depending on the number of distractors. While tDCS had no significant effects on target detection per se, error rates due to missed cues are increased under stimulation. Thus, while our variant led to successful replication of behavioral deafness effects, the results under tDCS stimulation indicate that the chosen paradigm may have difficulty too low to respond to stimulation. That the error rates nevertheless led to a tDCS effect may be due to the divided attention between the visual cue and the auditory target.</p>

	<p>Objective: In this study, we assessed the correlation between the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to phosphate ratio and the prognosis of microsurgical clippings for ruptured intracranial aneurysm (rIA) to test the hypothesis that the serum LDH to phosphate ratio could be a predictor of the outcome of microsurgical clipping for rIA. Methods: Records of rIA patients between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively collected. Age, sex, Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher grade, medical history, aneurysm location, hydrocephalus, laboratory data including serum LDH, phosphate, and LDH to phosphate ratio, related complications, and the outcomes in 3 months were recorded. Results: A total of 1608 rIA patients in our institution were collected, and 856 patients treated by microsurgical clipping were enrolled. On admission, a significantly higher LDH-phosphate ratio was observed in patients with poor outcomes at 3 months (median &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 200.175 &amp;amp;plusmn; 107.290 for mRS 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 vs. 323.826 &amp;amp;plusmn; 219.075 for mRS score 3&amp;amp;ndash;6; p = 0.000). An LDH to phosphate ratio of 226.25 in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was the optimal cutoff value to discriminate between good and poor outcomes at 3 months. The LDH to phosphate ratio &amp;amp;ge; 226.25 on admission was independently correlated with poor outcomes in rIA patients. In addition, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, pneumonia, and DIND were also independently correlated with poor outcomes. After removing the bias in essential clinical variables between patients with LDH to phosphate, ratio &amp;amp;ge; 226.25 versus &amp;amp;lt;226.25 by PSM, the number of patients with poor outcomes at 3 months increased in patients with an LDH to phosphate ratio of &amp;amp;ge;226.25 (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The LDH to phosphate ratio was a potential biomarker and could predict the unfavorable outcome of microsurgical clipping for rIA in 3 months, related to neuronal damage, cerebral hypoxia, and early brain injury after aneurysm ruptures.</p>

     alt="From retina to motoneurons: A substrate for visuomotor transformation in salamanders"/>
<p>We provide anatomical and physiological evidence of a retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway in salamanders. This pathway provides a substrate for the transformation of visual information into a motor command and is well positioned to control orienting behaviors when approaching a prey for instance.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing, we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labeled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labeled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Strain design optimization using reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maryam Sabzevari, Sandor Szedmak, Merja Penttilä, Paula Jouhten, Juho Rousu</p>

Engineered microbial cells present a sustainable alternative to fossil-based synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Cellular synthesis routes are readily assembled and introduced into microbial strains using state-of-the-art synthetic biology tools. However, the optimization of the strains required to reach industrially feasible production levels is far less efficient. It typically relies on trial-and-error leading into high uncertainty in total duration and cost. New techniques that can cope with the complexity and limited mechanistic knowledge of the cellular regulation are called for guiding the strain optimization.
In this paper, we put forward a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns from experiments to tune the metabolic enzyme levels so that the production is improved. Our method is model-free and does not assume prior knowledge of the microbe’s metabolic network or its regulation. The multi-agent approach is well-suited to make use of parallel experiments such as multi-well plates commonly used for screening microbial strains.
We demonstrate the method’s capabilities using the genome-scale kinetic model of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, k-ecoli457, as a surrogate for an <i>in vivo</i> cell behaviour in cultivation experiments. We investigate the method’s performance relevant for practical applicability in strain engineering i.e. the speed of convergence towards the optimum response, noise tolerance, and the statistical stability of the solutions found. We further evaluate the proposed MARL approach in improving L-tryptophan production by yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, using publicly available experimental data on the performance of a combinatorial strain library.
Overall, our results show that multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising approach for guiding the strain optimization beyond mechanistic knowledge, with the goal of faster and more reliably obtaining industrially attractive production levels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From affinity selection to kinetic selection in Germinal Centre modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Danial Lashgari, Elena Merino Tejero, Michael Meyer-Hermann, Mathieu A. F. Claireaux, Marit J. van Gils, Huub C. J. Hoefsloot, Antoine H. C. van Kampen</p>

Affinity maturation is an evolutionary process by which the affinity of antibodies (Abs) against specific antigens (Ags) increases through rounds of B-cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and positive selection in germinal centres (GC). The positive selection of B cells depends on affinity, but the underlying mechanisms of affinity discrimination and affinity-based selection are not well understood. It has been suggested that selection in GC depends on both rapid binding of B-cell receptors (BcRs) to Ags which is kinetically favourable and tight binding of BcRs to Ags, which is thermodynamically favourable; however, it has not been shown whether a selection bias for kinetic properties is present in the GC. To investigate the GC selection bias towards rapid and tight binding, we developed an agent-based model of GC and compared the evolution of founder B cells with initially identical low affinities but with different association/dissociation rates for Ag presented by follicular dendritic cells in three Ag collection mechanisms. We compared an Ag collection mechanism based on association/dissociation rates of B-cell interaction with presented Ag, which includes a probabilistic rupture of bonds between the B-cell and Ag (Scenario-1) with a reference scenario based on an affinity-based Ag collection mechanism (Scenario-0). Simulations showed that the mechanism of Ag collection affects the GC dynamics and the GC outputs concerning fast/slow (un)binding of B cells to FDC-presented Ags. In particular, clones with lower dissociation rates outcompete clones with higher association rates in Scenario-1, while remaining B cells from clones with higher association rates reach higher affinities. Accordingly, plasma cell and memory B cell populations were biased towards B-cell clones with lower dissociation rates. Without such probabilistic ruptures during the Ag extraction process (Scenario-2), the selective advantage for clones with very low dissociation rates diminished, and the affinity maturation level of all clones decreased to the reference level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CellDynaMo–stochastic reaction-diffusion-dynamics model: Application to search-and-capture process of mitotic spindle assembly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evgenii Kliuchnikov, Artem Zhmurov, Kenneth A. Marx, Alex Mogilner, Valeri Barsegov</p>

We introduce a Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion-Dynamics Model (SRDDM) for simulations of cellular mechanochemical processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The SRDDM model is mapped into the CellDynaMo package, which couples the spatially inhomogeneous reaction-diffusion master equation to account for biochemical reactions and molecular transport within the Langevin Dynamics (LD) framework to describe dynamic mechanical processes. This computational infrastructure allows the simulation of hours of molecular machine dynamics in reasonable wall-clock time. We apply the model to test performance of the Search-and-Capture model of mitotic spindle assembly by simulating, in three spatial dimensions, dynamic instability of elastic microtubules anchored in two centrosomes, movement and deformations of geometrically realistic centromeres with flexible kinetochores and chromosome arms. Furthermore, the SRDDM model describes the mechanics and kinetics of Ndc80 linkers mediating transient attachments of microtubules to the chromosomal kinetochores. The rates of these attachments and detachments depend upon phosphorylation states of the Ndc80 linkers, which are regulated in the model by explicitly accounting for the reactions of Aurora A and B kinase enzymes, which undergo restricted diffusion. We find that there is an optimal rate of microtubule-kinetochore detachments which maximizes the accuracy of the chromosome connections, that adding chromosome arms to kinetochores improve the accuracy by slowing down chromosome movements, that Aurora A and kinetochore deformations have a small positive effect on the attachment accuracy, and that thermal fluctuations of the microtubules increase the rates of kinetochore capture and also improve the accuracy of spindle assembly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Induced fit with replica exchange improves protein complex structure prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ameya Harmalkar, Sai Pooja Mahajan, Jeffrey J. Gray</p>

Despite the progress in prediction of protein complexes over the last decade, recent blind protein complex structure prediction challenges revealed limited success rates (less than 20% models with DockQ score > 0.4) on targets that exhibit significant conformational change upon binding. To overcome limitations in capturing backbone motions, we developed a new, aggressive sampling method that incorporates temperature replica exchange Monte Carlo (T-REMC) and conformational sampling techniques within docking protocols in Rosetta. Our method, ReplicaDock 2.0, mimics induced-fit mechanism of protein binding to sample backbone motions across putative interface residues on-the-fly, thereby recapitulating binding-partner induced conformational changes. Furthermore, ReplicaDock 2.0 clocks in at 150-500 CPU hours per target (protein-size dependent); a runtime that is significantly faster than Molecular Dynamics based approaches. For a benchmark set of 88 proteins with moderate to high flexibility (unbound-to-bound iRMSD over 1.2 Å), ReplicaDock 2.0 successfully docks 61% of moderately flexible complexes and 35% of highly flexible complexes. Additionally, we demonstrate that by biasing backbone sampling particularly towards residues comprising flexible loops or hinge domains, highly flexible targets can be predicted to under 2 Å accuracy. This indicates that additional gains are possible when mobile protein segments are known.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Addressing delayed case reporting in infectious disease forecast modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lauren J. Beesley, Dave Osthus, Sara Y. Del Valle</p>

Infectious disease forecasting is of great interest to the public health community and policymakers, since forecasts can provide insight into disease dynamics in the near future and inform interventions. Due to delays in case reporting, however, forecasting models may often <i>underestimate</i> the current and future disease burden.
In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing reporting delay in disease forecasting efforts with the goal of improving forecasts. We propose strategies for leveraging either historical data on case reporting or external internet-based data to estimate the amount of reporting error. We then describe several approaches for adapting general forecasting pipelines to account for under- or over-reporting of cases. We apply these methods to address reporting delay in data on dengue fever cases in Puerto Rico from 1990 to 2009 and to reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States between 2010 and 2019. Through a simulation study, we compare method performance and evaluate robustness to assumption violations. Our results show that forecasting accuracy and prediction coverage almost always increase when correction methods are implemented to address reporting delay. Some of these methods required knowledge about the reporting error or high quality external data, which may not always be available. Provided alternatives include excluding recently-reported data and performing sensitivity analysis. This work provides intuition and guidance for handling delay in disease case reporting and may serve as a useful resource to inform practical infectious disease forecasting efforts.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique to decipher tissue composition at the single-cell level and to inform on disease mechanisms, tumor heterogeneity, and the state of the immune microenvironment. Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and pathway alterations, and <i>in silico</i> identification of personalized candidate drug treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A musculoskeletal finite element model of rat knee joint for evaluating cartilage biomechanics during gait</a></h4>

Abnormal loading of the knee due to injuries or obesity is thought to contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Small animal models have been used for studying OA progression mechanisms. However, numerical models to study cartilage responses under dynamic loading in preclinical animal models have not been developed. Here we present a musculoskeletal finite element model of a rat knee joint to evaluate cartilage biomechanical responses during a gait cycle. The rat knee joint geometries were obtained from a 3-D MRI dataset and the boundary conditions regarding loading in the joint were extracted from a musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb. The fibril-reinforced poroelastic (FRPE) properties of the rat cartilage were derived from data of mechanical indentation tests. Our numerical results showed the relevance of simulating anatomical and locomotion characteristics in the rat knee joint for estimating tissue responses such as contact pressures, stresses, strains, and fluid pressures. We found that the contact pressure and maximum principal strain were virtually constant in the medial compartment whereas they showed the highest values at the beginning of the gait cycle in the lateral compartment. Furthermore, we found that the maximum principal stress increased during the stance phase of gait, with the greatest values at midstance. We anticipate that our approach serves as a first step towards investigating the effects of gait abnormalities on the adaptation and degeneration of rat knee joint tissues and could be used to evaluate biomechanically-driven mechanisms of the progression of OA as a consequence of joint injury or obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying the impact of ecological memory on the dynamics of interacting communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moein Khalighi, Guilhem Sommeria-Klein, Didier Gonze, Karoline Faust, Leo Lahti</p>

Ecological memory refers to the influence of past events on the response of an ecosystem to exogenous or endogenous changes. Memory has been widely recognized as a key contributor to the dynamics of ecosystems and other complex systems, yet quantitative community models often ignore memory and its implications.
Recent modeling studies have shown how interactions between community members can lead to the emergence of resilience and multistability under environmental perturbations. We demonstrate how memory can be introduced in such models using the framework of fractional calculus. We study how the outcomes of a well-characterized interaction model are affected by gradual increases in ecological memory under varying initial conditions, perturbations, and stochasticity.
Our results highlight the implications of memory on several key aspects of community dynamics. In general, memory introduces inertia into the dynamics. This favors species coexistence under perturbation, enhances system resistance to state shifts, mitigates hysteresis, and can affect system resilience both ways depending on the time scale considered. Memory also promotes long transient dynamics, such as long-standing oscillations and delayed regime shifts, and contributes to the emergence and persistence of alternative stable states. Our study highlights the fundamental role of memory on ecological communities, and provides quantitative tools to introduce it in ecological models and analyse its impact under varying conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alix is required for activity-dependent bulk endocytosis at brain synapses</a></h4>

Caudal, Na Zhao, Yvonne Schwarz, Marta Rolland, José Martinez-Hernandez, Magalie Martineau, Christine Chatellard, Eric Denarier, Vincent Mercier, Florent Lemaître, Béatrice Blot, Eve Moutaux, Maxime Cazorla, David Perrais, Fabien Lanté, Dieter Bruns, Sandrine Fraboulet, Fiona J. Hemming, Frank Kirchhoff, Rémy Sadoul</p>

In chemical synapses undergoing high frequency stimulation, vesicle components can be retrieved from the plasma membrane via a clathrin-independent process called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X/PDCD6IP) is an adaptor protein binding to ESCRT and endophilin-A proteins which is required for clathrin-independent endocytosis in fibroblasts. Alix is expressed in neurons and concentrates at synapses during epileptic seizures. Here, we used cultured neurons to show that Alix is recruited to presynapses where it interacts with and concentrates endophilin-A during conditions triggering ADBE. Using Alix knockout (ko) neurons, we showed that this recruitment, which requires interaction with the calcium-binding protein ALG-2, is necessary for ADBE. We also found that presynaptic compartments of Alix ko hippocampi display subtle morphological defects compatible with flawed synaptic activity and plasticity detected electrophysiologically. Furthermore, mice lacking Alix in the forebrain undergo less seizures during kainate-induced status epilepticus and reduced propagation of the epileptiform activity. These results thus show that impairment of ADBE due to the lack of neuronal Alix leads to abnormal synaptic recovery during physiological or pathological repeated stimulations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pleiotropic constraints promote the evolution of cooperation in cellular groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael A. Bentley, Christian A. Yates, Jotun Hein, Gail M. Preston, Kevin R. Foster</p>

The evolution of cooperation in cellular groups is threatened by lineages of cheaters that proliferate at the expense of the group. These cell lineages occur within microbial communities, and multicellular organisms in the form of tumours and cancer. In contrast to an earlier study, here we show how the evolution of pleiotropic genetic architectures—which link the expression of cooperative and private traits—can protect against cheater lineages and allow cooperation to evolve. We develop an age-structured model of cellular groups and show that cooperation breaks down more slowly within groups that tie expression to a private trait than in groups that do not. We then show that this results in group selection for pleiotropy, which strongly promotes cooperation by limiting the emergence of cheater lineages. These results predict that pleiotropy will rapidly evolve, so long as groups persist long enough for cheater lineages to threaten cooperation. Our results hold when pleiotropic links can be undermined by mutations, when pleiotropy is itself costly, and in mixed-genotype groups such as those that occur in microbes. Finally, we consider features of multicellular organisms—a germ line and delayed reproductive maturity—and show that pleiotropy is again predicted to be important for maintaining cooperation. The study of cancer in multicellular organisms provides the best evidence for pleiotropic constraints, where abberant cell proliferation is linked to apoptosis, senescence, and terminal differentiation. Alongside development from a single cell, we propose that the evolution of pleiotropic constraints has been critical for cooperation in many cellular groups.
