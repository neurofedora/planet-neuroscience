Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

The development of new concepts, such as ultrafast ultrasound, has enhanced Doppler sensitivity by orders of magnitude and has paved the way for ultrasonic functional neuroimaging. In this review, we position ultrasound in the field of neuroimaging and discuss how it complements current tools available to neurobiologists and clinicians. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to âlook and behaveâ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Christian R   Burgess, Yoav   Livneh, Rohan N   Ramesh, Mark L   Andermann<br /> Physiological need states and associated motivational drives can bias visual processing of cues that help meet these needs. Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, MickaÃ«l   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Steffen BE   Wolff, Bence P   Ãlveczky<br /> The development of increasingly sophisticated methods for recording and manipulating neural activity is revolutionizing neuroscience. By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Andy   Zhou, Benjamin C   Johnson, Rikky   Muller<br /> Closed-loop and responsive neuromodulation systems improve open-loop neurostimulation by responding directly to measured neural activity and providing adaptive, on-demand therapy. To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Gilles C   .Vanwalleghem, Misha B   Ahrens, Ethan K   Scott<br /> Due to their small size and transparency, zebrafish larvae are amenable to a range of fluorescence microscopy techniques. With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulusâresponse relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. <br /><br />

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide â¼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang<br /> Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type accessâprerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Johannes   Kohl, Catherine   Dulac<br /> Parenting is a multicomponent social behavior that is essential for the survival of offspring in many species. Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   LÃ¼ningschrÃ¶r, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Remco   Bredewold, Alexa H   Veenema<br /> To understand how the brain regulates behavior, many variables must be taken into account, with sex as a prominent variable. In this review, we will discuss recent human and rodent studies showing the sex-specific involvement of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in social and anxiety-related behaviors. We discuss that sex differences can be evident at pre-pubertal ages as seen in the sex-specific regulation of social recognition, social play, and anxiety by the vasopressin system in juvenile rats. We further discuss that the oxytocin system in humans and rodents alters brain activation, anxiety, and sociosexual motivation in sex-specific ways. Finally, we propose that knowledge of vasopressin and oxytocin mediated sex-specific brain mechanisms can provide essential insights into how these neuropeptide systems contribute to sex-specific vulnerability as well as resilience to perturbations, with subsequent relevance to social and emotional disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

<p>Beings, animate or inanimate, are dynamical systems which continuously
interact with the (external and /or internal) environment through the physical
or physiologic interfaces of their Kantian (representational) realities. And
the nature of their interactions is determined by the inner workings of their
systems. It is from this perspective that this work attempts to address some of
the long-held philosophical questions, major one among them consciousness-- in
the context of the physicality of the dynamic systems.

<p>The human brain network is modular--comprised of communities of tightly
interconnected nodes. This network contains local hubs, which have many
connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have
connections diversely distributed across communities. A mechanistic
understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been
demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and
cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the
cognitive performance of 476 individuals in four distinct tasks. Moreover,
there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive
performance--individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular
brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task.
Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which
connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbors to be more modular
while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities,
which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.

<p>by Hyun Jung Park, Soyeon Kim, Wei Li</p>

Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) has emerged as an important post-transcriptional mechanism that simultaneously alters expressions of thousands genes in cancers. However, only a few ceRNA genes have been studied for their functions to date. To understand the major biological functions of thousands ceRNA genes as a whole, we designed Model-based Analysis of Competing-endogenous Pathways (MACPath) to infer pathways co-regulated through ceRNA mechanism (cePathways). Our analysis on breast tumors suggested that NGF (nerve growth factor)-induced tumor cell proliferation might be associated with tumor-related growth factor pathways through ceRNA. MACPath also identified indirect cePathways, whose ceRNA relationship is mediated by mediating ceRNAs. Finally, MACPath identified mediating ceRNAs that connect the indirect cePathways based on efficient <i>integer linear programming</i> technique. Mediating ceRNAs are unexpectedly enriched in tumor suppressor genes, whose down-regulation is suspected to disrupt indirect cePathways, such as between DNA replication and WNT signaling pathways. Altogether, MACPath is the first computational method to comprehensively understand functions of thousands ceRNA genes, both direct and indirect, at the pathway level.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8vndNEzF5NY" width="1" />

<p>by Sabine Hummert, Susanne Thon, Thomas Eick, Ralf Schmauder, Eckhard Schulz, Klaus Benndorf</p>

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels control electrical rhythmicity in specialized brain and heart cells. We quantitatively analysed voltage-dependent activation of homotetrameric HCN2 channels and its modulation by the second messenger cAMP using global fits of hidden Markovian models to complex experimental data. We show that voltage-dependent activation is essentially governed by two separable voltage-dependent steps followed by voltage-independent opening of the pore. According to this model analysis, the binding of cAMP to the channels exerts multiple effects on the voltage-dependent gating: It stabilizes the open pore, reduces the total gating charge from ~8 to ~5, makes an additional closed state outside the activation pathway accessible and strongly accelerates the ON-gating but not the OFF-gating. Furthermore, the open channel has a much slower computed OFF-gating current than the closed channel, in both the absence and presence of cAMP. Together, these results provide detailed new insight into the voltage- and cAMP-induced activation gating of HCN channels.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/syBDlU90QXo" width="1" />

<p>by Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache</p>

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM" width="1" />

<p>by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet</p>

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partnerâs motion [1â4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partnerâs muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled oneâs lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8" width="1" />

<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich ELISA, this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 Â± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (<i>N</i> = 226, 32.97 Â± 8.36 ng/ml SD, <i>p</i> = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. While no association was observed with gender, a weak, positive correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.</p>

Abstract<p>Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² both activate the common type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1Î±, IL-Î², and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1Î± or IL-1Î² ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally-occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1Î± or IL-1Î² signaling.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability. Secondary signaling cascades, including neuroinflammation, trigger progressive neuronal injury following TBI. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major driver of the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury, but the impact of individual IL-1Î± or IL-1Î² blockade on TBI outcome had not been evaluated. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we dissected the contributions of IL-1Î±, IL-Î², and IL-1RI to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI. We show that genetic ablation of IL-1RI conferred the greatest benefit after TBI. Moreover, the beneficial effects were recapitulated by treatment with an IL-1RI antagonist. Given the need for the development of effective therapies that mitigate neurodegeneration after TBI, this is a timely, relevant area of study.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-17.2018v1?rss=1">Sensorimotor Representation of Speech Perception - Cross-Decoding of Place of Articulation Features during Selective Attention to Syllables in 7T fMRI</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI BOLD responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Speech is supported by sensorimotor integration, a bidirectional translation of its auditory and motoric signals. Whether our brain represents speech as articulatory features during selective attention has not yet been well specified. We focused on the representation of articulatory information of speech during attentive speech perception. For the first time, we applied generalization in classification analysis to counteract the differences in acoustic properties that accompany articulatory information. Participants attended to either the vowels or consonants of syllables, while undergoing fMRI. Our results show that articulatory information is represented in widespread cortical areas during selective attention to the different syllable components, supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception.</p>

<p>Selfridge, along with Sutherland and Marr provided some of the earliest
proposals for how to program computers to recognize shapes. Their emphasis on
filtering for contour features, especially the orientation of boundary
segments, was reinforced by the Nobel Prize winning work of Hubel &amp; Wiesel who
discovered that neurons in primary visual cortex selectively respond as a
function of contour orientation. Countless investigators and theorists have
continued to build on this approach. These models are often described as
neuromorphic, which implies that the computational methods are based on
biologically plausible principles. Recent work from the present lab has
challenged the emphasis on orientation selectivity and the use of neural
network principles. The goal of the present report is not to relitigate those
issues, but to provide an alternative concept for encoding of shape information
that may be useful to neuromorphic modelers.

<p>Intrinsic stochasticity can induce highly non-trivial effects on dynamical
systems, including stochastic and coherence resonance, noise induced
bistability, noise-induced oscillations, to name but a few. In this paper we
revisit a mechanism first investigated in the context of neuroscience by which
relatively small demographic (intrinsic) fluctuations can lead to the emergence
of avalanching behavior in systems that are deterministically characterized by
a single stable fixed point (up state). The anomalously large response of such
systems to stochasticity stems (or is strongly associated with) the existence
of a "non-normal" stability matrix at the deterministic fixed point, which may
induce the system to be "reactive". Here, we further investigate this mechanism
by exploring the interplay between non-normality and intrinsic (demographic)
stochasticity, by employing a number of analytical and computational
approaches. We establish, in particular, that the resulting dynamics in this
type of systems cannot be simply derived from a scalar potential but,
additionally, one needs to consider a curl flux which describes the essential
non-equilibrium nature of this type of noisy non-normal systems. Moreover, we
shed further light on the origin of the phenomenon, introduce the novel concept
of "non-linear reactivity", and rationalize of the observed the value of the
emerging avalanche exponents.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07770">Emergence of grid-like representations by training recurrent neural networks to perform spatial localization. (arXiv:1803.07770v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have
revealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex
(EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates,
including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However,
the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations
remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural
representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform
navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find
that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with
units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and
band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been
observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border
cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies.
Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as
observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently
given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.

How do we represent information that has no sensory features? How are abstract concepts like "freedom", devoid of external perceptible referents, represented in the brain? To address the role of sensory information in the neural representation of concepts, we investigated how people born blind process concepts whose referents are imperceptible to them because of their visual nature (e.g. "rainbow", or "red"). We find that the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (ATL) shows preference both to typical abstract concepts ("freedom") and to concepts whose referents are not sensorially-available to the blind ("rainbow"), as compared to partially sensorially-perceptible referents (e.g. "rain"). Activation pattern similarity in dorsal ATL is related to the sensorial-accessibility ratings of the concepts in the blind. Parts of inferior-lateral aspects of ATL and the temporal pole responded preferentially to abstract concepts devoid of any external referents ("freedom") relative to imperceptible objects, in effect distinguishing between object and non-object concepts. The medial ATL showed a preference for concrete concepts ("cup"), along with a preference for partly perceptible items to the blind ("rain", as compared with "rainbow"), indicating this region's role in representing concepts with sensory referents beyond vision. The findings point to a new division of labor among medial, dorsal and lateral aspects of ATL in representing different properties of object and non-object concepts.

In animals, commensal microbes modulate various physiological functions, including behavior. While microbiota exposure is required for normal behavior in mammals, it is not known how widely this dependency is present in other animal species. We proposed the hypothesis that the microbiome has a major influence on the behavior of the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster), a major invertebrate model organism. Several assays were used to test the contribution of the microbiome on some well-characterized behaviors: defensive behavior, sleep, locomotion, and courtship in microbe-bearing, control flies and two generations of germ-free animals. None of the behaviors were largely influenced by the absence of a microbiome, and the small or moderate effects were not generalizable between replicates and/or generations. These results refute the hypothesis, indicating that the Drosophila microbiome does not have a major influence over several behaviors fundamental to the animal's survival and reproduction. The impact of commensal microbes on animal behaviour may not be broadly conserved.

Misfolding and aggregation of tau protein are closely associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). By interrogating IgG+ memory B cells from asymptomatic donors with tau peptides, we have identified two somatically mutated VH5-51/VL4-1 antibodies. One of these, CBTAU-27.1, binds to the aggregation motif in the R3 repeat domain and blocks the aggregation of tau into paired helical filaments (PHFs) by sequestering monomeric tau. The other, CBTAU-28.1, binds to the N-terminal insert region and inhibits the spreading of tau seeds and mediates the uptake of tau aggregates into microglia by binding PHFs. Crystal structures revealed that the combination of VH5-51 and VL4-1 recognizes a common Pro-Xn-Lys motif driven by germline-encoded hotspot interactions while the specificity and thereby functionality of the antibodies are defined by the CDR3 regions. Affinity improvement led to improvement in functionality, identifying their epitopes as new targets for therapy and prevention of AD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286880v1?rss=1">Disrupted neural adaptation in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

There has been long-standing speculation that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves an increase in excitation relative to inhibition. However, there is little direct evidence of increased neural excitation in humans with ASD. Here we provide a potential explanation for this discrepancy: we show that increased neural excitation emerges only after repeated stimulation, manifesting as a deficit in neural adaptation. We measured fMRI responses induced by repeated audio-visual stimulation and button presses in early sensory-motor cortical areas. Across all cortical areas we show reduced adaptation in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical individuals. The degree of adaptation is correlated between cortical areas and with button-press reaction times across subjects. These findings suggest that increased neural excitation in ASD, manifesting as dysregulated neural adaptation, is domain-general and behaviorally-relevant.

This protocol describes a fluorescence birthdating technique to label, track and isolate isochronic cohorts of newborn cells in the central nervous system in vivo. Injection of carboxyfluorescein esters into the cerebral ventricle allows pulse-labeling of M-phase progenitors in touch with the ventricle and their progeny across the central nervous system, a procedure we termed FlashTag. Labeled cells can be imaged ex vivo or in fixed tissue, targeted for electrophysiological experiments, or isolated using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) for cell culture or (single-cell) RNA-sequencing. The dye is retained for several weeks, allowing labeled cells to be identified postnatally. This protocol describes the labeling procedure using in utero injection, the isolation of live cells using FACS, as well as the processing of labeled tissue using immunohistochemistry.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286773v1?rss=1">The Claustrum Coordinates Cortical Slow-Wave Activity</a></h4>

During sleep and awake rest, the neocortex generates large-scale slow-wave activity. Here we report that the claustrum, a poorly understood subcortical neural structure, coordinates neocortical slow-wave generation. We established a transgenic mouse line allowing genetic and electrophysiological interrogation of a subpopulation of claustral glutamatergic neurons. These claustral excitatory neurons received inputs from glutamatergic neurons in a large neocortical network. Optogenetic activation of claustral neurons in vitro induced excitatory post-synaptic responses in most neocortical neurons, but elicited action potentials primarily in inhibitory interneurons. Optogenetic activation of claustral neurons in vivo induced a Down-state featuring a prolonged silencing of neural acticity in all layers of many cortical areas, followed by a globally synchronized Down-to-Up state transition. These results demonstrate a crucial role of the claustrum in synchronizing inhibitory interneurons across the neocortex for spatiotemporal coordination of brain state. Thus, the claustrum is a major subcortical hub for the synchronization of neocortical slow-wave activity.

The constructive nature of vision is perhaps most evident during hallucinations, mental imagery, synesthesia, perceptual filling-in, and many illusions in which conscious visual experience does not overtly correspond to retinal stimulation: phantom vision. However, the relationship between voluntary and involuntary phantom vision remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated two forms of visual phantom color, neon phantom color spreading and voluntary color mental imagery and their effect on subsequent binocular rivalry perception. Passively viewing neon phantom color induced time sensitive, suppressive effects on spatially non-overlapping subsequent binocular rivalry. These effects could be attenuated by rotating the color-inducers, or like color imagery, by concurrent uniform luminance stimulation. The degree of neon color induced rivalry suppression predicted the degree of voluntary color imagery facilitation, both on subsequent rivalry perception. Further, these suppressive and facilitative effects were additive when experienced successively. Our results suggest potential sensory mechanistic commonalities between voluntary and involuntary phantom vision.

Brain coding strategies are enabled by the balance of synaptic inputs that individual neurons receive as determined by the networks in which they reside. Inhibitory cell types contribute to brain function in distinct ways but recording from specific, inhibitory cell types during behaviour to determine their contributions is difficult. In particular, the in vivo activities of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneuron specific 3 (IS3) cells in the hippocampus that only target other inhibitory cells are unknown at present. We perform a massive, computational exploration of possible synaptic inputs to IS3 cells using multi-compartment models and optimized synaptic parameters. We find that asynchronous in vivo-like states that are sensitive to additional theta-timed inputs exist when excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances are equally balanced and there are low amounts of correlated inputs. Thus, using a generally applicable computational approach we predict the existence of balanced states in hippocampal circuits during rhythmic activities.

Mammals use distances and directions from local objects to calculate trajectories during navigation but how such vectorial operations are implemented in neural representations of space has not been determined. Here we show in freely moving mice that a population of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) responds specifically when the animal is at a given distance and direction from a spatially confined object. These "object-vector cells" are tuned similarly to a spectrum of discrete objects, irrespective of their location in the test arena. The vector relationships are expressed from the outset in novel environments with novel objects. Object-vector cells are distinct from grid cells, which use a distal reference frame, but the cells exhibit some mixed selectivity with head-direction and border cells. Collectively, these observations show that object locations are integrated in metric representations of self-location, with specific subsets of MEC neurons encoding vector relationships to individual objects.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285973v1?rss=1">Individual differences in response precision correlate with adaptation bias</a></h4>

The internal representation of stimuli is imperfect and subject to bias. Noise introduced at initial encoding and during maintenance degrades the precision of representation. Stimulus estimation is also biased away from recently encountered stimuli, a phenomenon known as adaptation. Within a Bayesian framework, greater biases are predicted to result from poor precision. We tested for this effect in individual difference measures. 202 subjects contributed data through an on-line experiment (https://cfn.upenn.edu/iadapt). During separate face and color blocks, subjects performed three different tasks: an immediate stimulus-match (15 trials), a 5 seconds delayed match (30 trials), and 5 seconds of adaptation followed by a delayed match (30 trials). The stimulus spaces were circular and subjects entered their responses using a color/face wheel. Bias and precision of responses were extracted by fitting a mixture of von Mises distributions to account for random guesses. Two blocks of each measure were obtained, allowing for tests of measure reliability. We found that reliable differences between individuals in precision were as great as those between tasks or materials. The adaptation manipulation induced the expected bias in responses (colors: 7.8{degrees} faces: 5.0{degrees}), and the magnitude of this bias reliably and substantially varied between subjects. Across subjects, there was a negative correlation between mean precision and bias (color: {rho} = -0.26; faces: {rho} = -0.13). This relationship was replicated in a new experiment with 192 subjects (color: {rho} = -0.22; faces: {rho} = -0.19). This result is consistent with a Bayesian observer model, in which individual differences in the precision of perceptual representation influences the magnitude of adaptation bias.

Young adult APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers show increased activity in posterior regions of the default mode network (pDMN), but how this is related to structural connectivity is unknown. Thirty young adults (half APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers, the other half APOE-{varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}2{varepsilon}3; mean age 20 years) were scanned using both diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tractography was used to quantify the microstructure (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA) of the parahippocampal cingulum bundle (PHCB), which links pDMN and the medial temporal lobe. APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers had lower MD and higher FA relative to non-carriers in PHCB. Further, PHCB microstructure was selectively associated with pDMN activity during a scene discrimination task known to be sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings are consistent with a lifespan view of AD risk, where early-life structural and functional brain changes in specific, vulnerable networks leads to increased neural activity that may ultimately trigger amyloid-{beta} deposition.

Genetic differences contribute to variations in the immune response mounted by different individuals to a pathogen. Such differential response can influence the spread of infectious disease, indicating why such diseases impact some populations more than others. Here, we study the impact of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. For a population with known HLA class-I allele frequency and for a given H1N1 viral strain, we classify individuals into sub-populations according to their level of susceptibility to infection. Our core hypothesis is that the susceptibility of a given individual to a disease such as H1N1 influenza is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity viral epitopes the individual can present. This number can be extracted from the HLA genetic profile of the individual. We use ethnicity-specific HLA class-I allele frequency data, together with genome sequences of various H1N1 viral strains, to obtain susceptibility sub-populations for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, as well as 85 strains isolated in other years. We incorporate these data into a multi-compartment SIR model to analyse the epidemic dynamics for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that HLA allele profiles which lead to a large spread in individual susceptibility values can act as a protective barrier against the spread of influenza. We predict that populations skewed such that a small number of highly susceptible individuals coexist with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but distributed more uniformly across individuals. Our model tracks some well-known qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, suggesting that HLA genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the spreading potential of different influenza viral strains across populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x5hYH_0EN7g" width="1" />

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) consist of a population of self-renewing cells displaying extensive phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Research towards the understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity among ESCs is still in its initial stage. Key issues, such as how to identify cell-subset specifically methylated loci and how to interpret the biological meanings of methylation variations remain largely unexplored. To fill in the research gap, we implemented a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell methylome and to perform an integrative analysis with single-cell transcriptome data. According to the origins of variation in DNA methylation, we determined the genomic loci associated with allelic-specific methylation or asymmetric DNA methylation, and explored a beta mixture model to infer the genomic loci exhibiting cell-subset specific methylation (CSM). We observed that the putative CSM loci in ESCs are significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shelves and regions with histone marks for promoter and enhancer, and the genes hosting putative CSM loci show wide-ranging expression among ESCs. More interestingly, the putative CSM loci may be clustered into co-methylated modules enriching the binding motifs of distinct sets of transcription factors. Taken together, our study provided a novel tool to explore single-cell methylome and transcriptome to reveal the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks associated with epigenetic heterogeneity of ESCs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7Po2bpx1o8" width="1" />

<p>Hippocampal ripples are involved in memory consolidation, but the mechanisms underlying their generation remain unclear. Models relying on interneuron networks in the CA1 region disagree on the predominant source of excitation to interneurons: either "direct," via the Schaffer collaterals that provide feedforward input from CA3 to CA1, or "indirect," via the local pyramidal cells in CA1, which are embedded in a recurrent excitatory-inhibitory network. Here, we used physiologically constrained computational models of basket-cell networks to investigate how they respond to different conditions of transient, noisy excitation. We found that direct excitation of interneurons could evoke ripples (140â220 Hz) that exhibited intraripple frequency accommodation and were frequency-insensitive to GABA modulators, as previously shown in <i>in vitro</i> experiments. In addition, the indirect excitation of the basket-cell network enabled the expression of intraripple frequency accommodation in the fast-gamma range (90â140 Hz), as <i>in vivo</i>. In our model, intraripple frequency accommodation results from a hysteresis phenomenon in which the frequency responds differentially to the rising and descending phases of the transient excitation. Such a phenomenon predicts a maximum oscillation frequency occurring several milliseconds before the peak of excitation. We confirmed this prediction for ripples in brain slices from male mice. These results suggest that ripple and fast-gamma episodes are produced by the same interneuron network that is recruited via different excitatory input pathways, which could be supported by the previously reported intralaminar connectivity bias between basket cells and functionally distinct subpopulations of pyramidal cells in CA1. Together, our findings unify competing inhibition-first models of rhythm generation in the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hippocampus is a part of the brain of humans and other mammals that is critical for the acquisition and consolidation of memories. During deep sleep and resting periods, the hippocampus generates high-frequency (~200 Hz) oscillations called ripples, which are important for memory consolidation. The mechanisms underlying ripple generation are not well understood. A prominent hypothesis holds that the ripples are generated by local recurrent networks of inhibitory neurons. Using computational models and experiments in brain slices from rodents, we show that the dynamics of interneuron networks clarify several previously unexplained characteristics of ripple oscillations, which advances our understanding of hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/3116?rss=1">Visual Working Memory Is Independent of the Cortical Spacing Between Memoranda</a></h4>

<p>The sensory recruitment hypothesis states that visual short-term memory is maintained in the same visual cortical areas that initially encode a stimulus' features. Although it is well established that the distance between features in visual cortex determines their visibility, a limitation known as crowding, it is unknown whether short-term memory is similarly constrained by the cortical spacing of memory items. Here, we investigated whether the cortical spacing between sequentially presented memoranda affects the fidelity of memory in humans (of both sexes). In a first experiment, we varied cortical spacing by taking advantage of the log-scaling of visual cortex with eccentricity, presenting memoranda in peripheral vision sequentially along either the radial or tangential visual axis with respect to the fovea. In a second experiment, we presented memoranda sequentially either within or beyond the critical spacing of visual crowding, a distance within which visual features cannot be perceptually distinguished due to their nearby cortical representations. In both experiments and across multiple measures, we found strong evidence that the ability to maintain visual features in memory is unaffected by cortical spacing. These results indicate that the neural architecture underpinning working memory has properties inconsistent with the known behavior of sensory neurons in visual cortex. Instead, the dissociation between perceptual and memory representations supports a role of higher cortical areas such as posterior parietal or prefrontal regions or may involve an as yet unspecified mechanism in visual cortex in which stimulus features are bound to their temporal order.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although much is known about the resolution with which we can remember visual objects, the cortical representation of items held in short-term memory remains contentious. A popular hypothesis suggests that memory of visual features is maintained via the recruitment of the same neural architecture in sensory cortex that encodes stimuli. We investigated this claim by manipulating the spacing in visual cortex between sequentially presented memoranda such that some items shared cortical representations more than others while preventing perceptual interference between stimuli. We found clear evidence that short-term memory is independent of the intracortical spacing of memoranda, revealing a dissociation between perceptual and memory representations. Our data indicate that working memory relies on different neural mechanisms from sensory perception.</p>

<p>Pain associates both sensory and emotional aversive components, and often leads to anxiety and depression when it becomes chronic. Here, we characterized, in a mouse model, the long-term development of these sensory and aversive components as well as anxiodepressive-like consequences of neuropathic pain and determined their electrophysiological impact on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, cortical areas 24a/24b). We show that these symptoms of neuropathic pain evolve and recover in different time courses following nerve injury in male mice. <i>In vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings evidence an increased firing rate and bursting activity within the ACC when anxiodepressive-like consequences developed, and this hyperactivity persists beyond the period of mechanical hypersensitivity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings also support ACC hyperactivity, as shown by increased excitatory postsynaptic transmission and contribution of NMDA receptors. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC hyperactivity was sufficient to alleviate the aversive and anxiodepressive-like consequences of neuropathic pain, indicating that these consequences are underpinned by ACC hyperactivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression. It has been shown that it is possible to model this comorbidity in animal models by taking into consideration the time factor. In this study, we aimed at determining the dynamic of different components and consequences of chronic pain, and correlated them with electrophysiological alterations. By combining electrophysiological, optogenetic, and behavioral analyses in a mouse model of neuropathic pain, we show that the mechanical hypersensitivity, ongoing pain, anxiodepressive consequences, and their recoveries do not necessarily exhibit temporal synchrony during chronic pain processing, and that the hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex is essential for driving the emotional impact of neuropathic pain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/3092?rss=1">Detecting Unattended Stimuli Depends on the Phase of Prestimulus Neural Oscillations</a></h4>

<p>Neural oscillations appear important for perception and attention processes because stimulus detection is dependent upon the phase of 7â11 Hz oscillations before stimulus onset. Previous work has examined stimulus detection at attended locations, but it is unknown whether unattended locations are also subject to phasic modulation by ongoing oscillatory activity, as would be predicted by theories proposing a role for neural oscillations in organizing general neural processing. Here, we recorded brain activity with EEG while human participants of both sexes detected brief visual targets preceded by a spatial cue and determined whether performance for cued (attended) and uncued (unattended) targets was influenced by oscillatory phase across a range of frequencies. Detection of both attended and unattended targets depended upon an ~5 Hz theta rhythm and an ~11â15 Hz alpha rhythm. Critically, detection of unattended stimuli was more strongly modulated by the phase of theta oscillations than was detection of attended stimuli, suggesting that attentional allocation involves a disengagement from ongoing theta sampling. There was no attention-related difference in the strength of alpha phase dependence, consistent with a perceptual rather than attentional role of oscillatory phase in this frequency range. These results demonstrate the importance of neural oscillations in modulating visual processing at both attended and unattended locations and clarify one way in which attention may produce its effects: through disengagement from low-frequency sampling at attended locations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Past work on the interaction between oscillatory phase and neural processing has shown the involvement of posterior ~7â11 Hz oscillations in visual processing. Most studies, however, have presented stimuli at attended locations, making it difficult to disentangle frequencies related to attention from those related to perception. Here, we compared the oscillatory frequencies involved in the detection of attended and unattended stimuli and found that ~11â15 Hz oscillations were related to perception independently of attention, whereas ~5 Hz oscillations were more prominent for the detection of unattended stimuli. This work demonstrates the importance of neural oscillations for mediating stimulus processing at both attended and unattended locations and clarifies the different oscillatory frequencies involved in attention and perception.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/3081?rss=1">Ultrasound Elicits Behavioral Responses through Mechanical Effects on Neurons and Ion Channels in a Simple Nervous System</a></h4>

<p>Focused ultrasound has been shown to stimulate excitable cells, but the biophysical mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain poorly understood. To provide additional insight, we devised a behavioral-genetic assay applied to the well-characterized nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes. We found that pulsed ultrasound elicits robust reversal behavior in wild-type animals in a pressure-, duration-, and pulse protocol-dependent manner. Responses were preserved in mutants unable to sense thermal fluctuations and absent in mutants lacking neurons required for mechanosensation. Additionally, we found that the worm's response to ultrasound pulses rests on the expression of MEC-4, a DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel required for touch sensation. Consistent with prior studies of MEC-4-dependent currents <i>in vivo</i>, the worm's response was optimal for pulses repeated 300â1000 times per second. Based on these findings, we conclude that mechanical, rather than thermal, stimulation accounts for behavioral responses. Further, we propose that acoustic radiation force governs the response to ultrasound in a manner that depends on the touch receptor neurons and MEC-4-dependent ion channels. Our findings illuminate a complete pathway of ultrasound action, from the forces generated by propagating ultrasound to an activation of a specific ion channel. The findings further highlight the importance of optimizing ultrasound pulsing protocols when stimulating neurons via ion channels with mechanosensitive properties.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How ultrasound influences neurons and other excitable cells has remained a mystery for decades. Although it is widely understood that ultrasound can heat tissues and induce mechanical strain, whether or not neuronal activation depends on heat, mechanical force, or both physical factors is not known. We harnessed <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes and their extraordinary sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli to address this question. Whereas thermosensory mutants respond to ultrasound similar to wild-type animals, mechanosensory mutants were insensitive to ultrasound stimulation. Additionally, stimulus parameters that accentuate mechanical effects were more effective than those producing more heat. These findings highlight a mechanical nature of the effect of ultrasound on neurons and suggest specific ways to optimize stimulation protocols in specific tissues.</p>

<p>Acute influenza infection has been reported to be associated with neurological symptoms. However, the long-term consequences of an infection with neurotropic and non-neurotropic influenza A virus (IAV) variants for the CNS remain elusive. We can show that spine loss in the hippocampus after infection with neurotropic H7N7 (rSC35M) and non-neurotropic H3N2 (maHK68) in female C57BL/6 mice persists well beyond the acute phase of the disease. Although spine number was significantly reduced at 30 d postinfection (dpi) with H7N7 or H3N2, full recovery could only be observed much later at 120 dpi. Infection with H1N1 virus, which was shown previously to affect spine number and hippocampus-dependent learning acutely, had no significant long-term effects. Spine loss was associated with an increase in the number of activated microglia, reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, and impairment in spatial memory formation, indicating that IAV-associated inflammation induced functional and structural alterations in hippocampal networks. Transcriptome analyses revealed regulation of many inflammatory and neuron- and glia-specific genes in H3N2- and H7N7-infected mice at day 18 and in H7N7-infected mice at day 30 pi that related to the structural and functional alterations. Our data provide evidence that neuroinflammation induced by neurotropic H7N7 and infection of the lung with a non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV result in long-term impairments in the CNS. IAV infection in humans may therefore not only lead to short-term responses in infected organs, but may also trigger neuroinflammation and associated chronic alterations in the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the acute phase of influenza infection, neuroinflammation can lead to alterations in hippocampal neuronal morphology and cognitive deficits. The results of this study now also provide evidence that neuroinflammation induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection can induce longer-lasting, virus-specific alterations in neuronal connectivity that are still detectable 1 month after infection and are associated with impairments in spatial memory formation. IAV infection in humans may therefore not only lead to short-term responses in infected organs, but may also trigger neuroinflammation and associated chronic alterations in the CNS.</p>

<p>Most of our knowledge about vision comes from experiments in which stimuli are presented to immobile human subjects or animals. In the case of human subjects, movement during psychophysical, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging experiments is considered to be a source of noise to be eliminated. Animals used in visual neuroscience experiments are typically restrained and, in many cases, anesthetized. In reality, however, vision is often used to guide the motion of awake, ambulating organisms. Recent work in mice has shown that locomotion elevates visual neuronal response amplitudes (Niell and Stryker, 2010; Erisken et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Mineault et al., 2016) and reduces long-range gain control (Ayaz et al., 2013). Here, we used both psychophysics and steady-state electrophysiology to investigate whether similar effects of locomotion on early visual processing can be measured in humans. Our psychophysical results show that brisk walking has little effect on subjects' ability to detect briefly presented contrast changes and that co-oriented flankers are, if anything, more effective masks when subjects are walking. Our electrophysiological data were consistent with the psychophysics indicating no increase in stimulus-driven neuronal responses while walking and no reduction in surround suppression. In summary, we have found evidence that early contrast processing is altered by locomotion in humans but in a manner that differs from that reported in mice. The effects of locomotion on very low-level visual processing may differ on a species-by-species basis and may reflect important differences in the levels of arousal associated with locomotion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mice are the current model of choice for studying low-level visual processing. Recent studies have shown that mouse visual cortex is modulated by behavioral state: primary visual cortex neurons in locomoting mice tend to be more sensitive and less influenced by long-range gain control. Here, we tested these effects in humans by measuring psychophysical detection thresholds and electroencephalography (EEG) responses while subjects walked on a treadmill. We found no evidence of increased contrast sensitivity or reduced surround suppression in walking humans. Our data show that fundamental measurements of early visual processing differ between humans and mice and this has important implications for recent work on the links among arousal, behavior, and vision in these two species.</p>

<p>The brainstem preBoÌtzinger complex (preBoÌtC) generates the inspiratory rhythm for breathing. The onset of neural activity that precipitates the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle may depend on the activity of type-1 preBoÌtC neurons, which exhibit a transient outward K<sup>+</sup> current, <i>I</i><sub>A</sub>. Inspiratory rhythm generation can be studied <i>ex vivo</i> because the preBoÌtC remains rhythmically active <i>in vitro</i>, both in acute brainstem slices and organotypic cultures. Advantageous optical conditions in organotypic slice cultures from newborn mice of either sex allowed us to investigate how <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> impacts Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurring in the dendrites of rhythmically active type-1 preBoÌtC neurons. The amplitude of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients evoked via voltage increases originating from the soma significantly increased after an <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> antagonist, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), was applied to the perfusion bath or to local dendritic regions. Similarly, glutamate-evoked postsynaptic depolarizations recorded at the soma increased in amplitude when 4-AP was coapplied with glutamate at distal dendritic locations. We conclude that I<sub>A</sub> is expressed on type-1 preBoÌtC neuron dendrites. We propose that <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> filters synaptic input, shunting sparse excitation, while enabling temporally summated events to pass more readily as a result of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> inactivation. Dendritic <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> in rhythmically active preBoÌtC neurons could thus ensure that inspiratory motor activity does not occur until excitatory synaptic drive is synchronized and well coordinated among cellular constituents of the preBoÌtC during inspiratory rhythmogenesis. The biophysical properties of dendritic <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> might thus promote robustness and regularity of breathing rhythms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brainstem neurons in the preBoÌtC generate the oscillatory activity that underlies breathing. PreBoÌtC neurons express voltage-dependent currents that can influence inspiratory activity, among which is a transient potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>A</sub>) previously identified in a rhythmogenic excitatory subset of type-1 preBoÌtC neurons. We sought to determine whether <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> is expressed in the dendrites of preBoÌtC. We found that dendrites of type-1 preBoÌtC neurons indeed express <i>I</i><sub>A</sub>, which may aid in shunting sparse non-summating synaptic inputs, while enabling strong summating excitatory inputs to readily pass and thus influence somatic membrane potential trajectory. The subcellular distribution of <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> in rhythmically active neurons of the preBoÌtC may thus be critical for producing well coordinated ensemble activity during inspiratory burst formation.</p>

<p>Gamma oscillations are involved in long-range coupling of distant regions that support various cognitive operations. Here we show in adult male rats that synchronized bursts of gamma oscillations bind the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during slow oscillations and slow-wave sleep, a brain state that is central for consolidation of memory traces. These gamma bursts entrained the firing of the local HPC and mPFC neuronal populations. Neurons of the nucleus reuniens (NR), which is a structural and functional hub between HPC and mPFC, demonstrated a specific increase in their firing before gamma burst onset, suggesting their involvement in HPCâmPFC binding. Chemical inactivation of NR disrupted the temporal pattern of gamma bursts and their synchronization, as well as mPFC neuronal firing. We propose that the NR drives long-range hippocampoâprefrontal coupling via gamma bursts providing temporal windows for information exchange between the HPC and mPFC during slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-range coupling between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is believed to support numerous cognitive functions, including memory consolidation occurring during sleep. Gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process in many neuronal operations and is instrumental in long-range coupling. Recent evidence highlights the role of nucleus reuniens (NR) in consolidation; however, how it influences hippocampoâprefrontal coupling is unknown. In this study, we show that HPC and mPFC are synchronized by gamma bursts during slow oscillations in anesthesia and natural sleep. By manipulating and recording the NRâHPCâmPFC network, we provide evidence that the NR actively promotes this long-range gamma coupling. This coupling provides the hippocampoâprefrontal circuit with a novel mechanism to exchange information during slow-wave sleep.</p>

<p>Sleep spindles are a cardinal feature in human NREM sleep and may be important for memory consolidation. We studied the intracortical organization of spindles in men and women by recording spontaneous sleep spindles from different cortical layers using linear microelectrode arrays. Two patterns of spindle generation were identified using visual inspection, and confirmed with factor analysis. Spindles (10â16 Hz) were largest and most common in upper and middle channels, with limited involvement of deep channels. Many spindles were observed in only upper or only middle channels, but approximately half occurred in both. In spindles involving both middle and upper channels, the spindle envelope onset in middle channels led upper by ~25â50 ms on average. The phase relationship between spindle waves in upper and middle channels varied dynamically within spindle epochs, and across individuals. Current source density analysis demonstrated that upper and middle channel spindles were both generated by an excitatory supragranular current sink while an additional deep source was present for middle channel spindles only. Only middle channel spindles were accompanied by deep low (25â50 Hz) and high (70â170 Hz) gamma activity. These results suggest that upper channel spindles are generated by supragranular pyramids, and middle channel by infragranular. Possibly, middle channel spindles are generated by core thalamocortical afferents, and upper channel by matrix. The concurrence of these patterns could reflect engagement of cortical circuits in the integration of more focal (core) and distributed (matrix) aspects of memory. These results demonstrate that at least two distinct intracortical systems generate human sleep spindles.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bursts of ~14 Hz oscillations, lasting ~1 s, have been recognized for over 80 years as cardinal features of mammalian sleep. Recent findings suggest that they play a key role in organizing cortical activity during memory consolidation. We used linear microelectrode arrays to study their intracortical organization in humans. We found that spindles could be divided into two types. One mainly engages upper layers of the cortex, which are considered to be specialized for associative activity. The other engages both upper and middle layers, including those devoted to sensory input. The interaction of these two spindle types may help organize the interaction of sensory and associative aspects of memory consolidation.</p>

<p>BLA neurons serve a well-accepted role in fear conditioning and fear extinction. However, the specific learning processes related to their activity at different times during learning remain poorly understood. We addressed this using behavioral tasks isolating distinct aspects of fear learning in male rats. We show that brief optogenetic inhibition of BLA neurons around moments of aversive reinforcement or nonreinforcement causes reductions in the salience of conditioned stimuli, rendering these stimuli less able to be learned about and less able to control fear or safety behaviors. This salience reduction was stimulus-specific, long-lasting, and specific to learning about, or responding to, the same aversive outcome, precisely the goals of therapeutic interventions in human anxiety disorders. Our findings identify a core learning process disrupted by brief BLA optogenetic inhibition. They show that a primary function of the unconditioned stimulus-evoked activity of BLA neurons is to maintain the salience of conditioned stimuli that precede it. This maintenance of salience is a necessary precursor for these stimuli to gain and maintain control over fear and safety behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The amygdala is essential for learning to fear and learning to reduce fear. However, the specific roles served by activity of different amygdala neurons at different times during learning is poorly understood. We used behavioral tasks isolating distinct aspects of learning in rats to show that brief optogenetic inhibition of BLA neurons around moments of reinforcement or nonreinforcement disrupts maintenance of conditioned stimulus salience. This causes a stimulus-specific and long-lasting deficit in the ability of the conditioned stimulus to be learned about or control fear responses. These consequences are the precisely goals of therapeutic interventions in human anxiety disorders. Our findings identify a core learning process disrupted by brief BLA optogenetic inhibition.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/2990?rss=1">GUCY2D Cone-Rod Dystrophy-6 Is a "Phototransduction Disease" Triggered by Abnormal Calcium Feedback on Retinal Membrane Guanylyl Cyclase 1</a></h4>

<p>The Arg838Ser mutation in retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase 1 (RetGC1) has been linked to autosomal dominant coneârod dystrophy type 6 (CORD6). It is believed that photoreceptor degeneration is caused by the altered sensitivity of RetGC1 to calcium regulation via guanylyl cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs). To determine the mechanism by which this mutation leads to degeneration, we investigated the structure and function of rod photoreceptors in two transgenic mouse lines, 362 and 379, expressing R838S RetGC1. In both lines, rod outer segments became shorter than in their nontransgenic siblings by 3â4 weeks of age, before the eventual photoreceptor degeneration. Despite the shortening of their outer segments, the dark current of transgenic rods was 1.5â2.2-fold higher than in nontransgenic controls. Similarly, the dim flash response amplitude in <i>R838S</i><sup>+</sup> rods was larger, time to peak was delayed, and flash sensitivity was increased, all suggesting elevated dark-adapted free cGMP in transgenic rods. In rods expressing R838S RetGC1, dark-current noise increased and the exchange current, detected after a saturating flash, became more pronounced. These results suggest disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> phototransduction feedback and abnormally high free-Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the outer segments. Notably, photoreceptor degeneration, which typically occurred after 3 months of age in R838S RetGC1 transgenic mice in <i>GCAP1,2</i><sup>+/+</sup> or <i>GCAP1,2</i><sup>+/â</sup> backgrounds, was prevented in <i>GCAP1,2</i><sup>â/â</sup> mice lacking Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback to guanylyl cyclase. In summary, the dysregulation of guanylyl cyclase in RetGC1-linked CORD6 is a "phototransduction disease," which means it is associated with increased free-cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in photoreceptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In a mouse model expressing human membrane guanylyl cyclase 1 (RetGC1, <i>GUCY2D</i>), a mutation associated with early progressing congenital blindness, coneârod dystrophy type 6 (CORD6), deregulates calcium-sensitive feedback of phototransduction to the cyclase mediated by guanylyl cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs), which are calcium-sensor proteins. The abnormal calcium sensitivity of the cyclase increases cGMP-gated dark current in the rod outer segments, reshapes rod photoresponses, and triggers photoreceptor death. This work is the first to demonstrate a direct physiological effect of <i>GUCY2D</i> CORD6-linked mutation on photoreceptor physiology <i>in vivo</i>. It also identifies the abnormal regulation of the cyclase by calcium-sensor proteins as the main trigger for the photoreceptor death.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/2981?rss=1">Individual Differences in Reading Skill Are Related to Trial-by-Trial Neural Activation Variability in the Reading Network</a></h4>

<p>Recent work has suggested that variability in levels of neural activation may be related to behavioral and cognitive performance across a number of domains and may offer information that is not captured by more traditional measures that use the average level of brain activation. We examined the relationship between reading skill in school-aged children and neural activation variability during a functional MRI reading task after taking into account average levels of activity. The reading task involved matching printed and spoken words to pictures of items. Single trial activation estimates were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of children's responses to print and speech stimuli; multiple regression analyses evaluated the relationship between reading skill and trial-by-trial activation variability. The reliability of observed findings from the discovery sample (<i>n</i> = 44; ages 8â11; 18 female) was then confirmed in an independent sample of children (<i>n</i> = 32; ages 8â11; 14 female). Across the two samples, reading skill was positively related to trial-by-trial variability in the activation response to print in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. This relationship held even when accounting for mean levels of activation. This finding suggests that intrasubject variability in trial-by-trial fMRI activation responses to printed words accounts for individual differences in human reading ability that are not fully captured by traditional mean levels of brain activity. Furthermore, this positive relationship between trial-by-trial activation variability and reading skill may provide evidence that neural variability plays a beneficial role during early reading development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent work has suggested that neural activation variability, or moment-to-moment changes in the engagement of brain regions, is related to individual differences in behavioral and cognitive performance across multiple domains. However, differences in neural activation variability have not yet been evaluated in relation to reading skill. In the current study, we analyzed data from two independent groups of children who performed an fMRI task involving reading and listening to words. Across both samples, reading skill was positively related to trial-by-trial variability in activation to print stimuli in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis, even when accounting for the more conventional measure of mean levels of brain activity. This finding suggests that neural variability could be beneficial in developing readers.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/2967?rss=1">Auditory Input Shapes Tonotopic Differentiation of Kv1.1 Expression in Avian Cochlear Nucleus during Late Development</a></h4>

<p>Tonotopic differentiation is fundamental for signal processing in the auditory system. However, when and how this differentiation arises remain elusive. We addressed this issue using electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry in nucleus magnocellularis of chickens of both sexes, which is known to differ in the expression of Kv1.1 channels depending on characteristic frequency (CF). Just after hearing onset (embryonic day 12â14), Kv1 current gradually increased to a slightly larger extent in neurons with higher CF, causing a tonotopic difference of Kv1 current before hatch. However, after hatch, a much larger increase of Kv1 current occurred, particularly in higher-CF neurons, due to an augmentation of Kv1.1 expression at the plasma membrane. This later change in expression led to the large tonotopic difference of Kv1 current characteristic of mature animals. Attenuation of auditory input by inducing conductive or sensorineural hearing loss around hatch suppressed the differentiation in a level-dependent manner. Moreover, elevation of auditory input during embryonic periods could not reproduce the differentiation, suggesting that the capacity of neurons to drive Kv1.1 expression via auditory input develops in a cell-specific manner, thus underlying the frequency-specific expression of the channel within the nucleus. The results indicated that the tonotopic differentiation of Kv1.1 in nucleus magnocellularis is partially determined before hatch, but largely driven by afferent input after hatch. Our results highlight the importance of neuronal capacity for sound to drive ion channel expression as well as the level of auditory experience in the frequency tuning of brainstem auditory circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tuning-frequency-specific expression of ion channels is a prerequisite for auditory system function, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we revealed in avian cochlear nucleus that the expression of Kv1.1 became more dependent on auditory input at a late period of maturation in neurons tuned to higher-frequency sound, leading to frequency-specific Kv1.1 expression. Attenuation of auditory input during this period suppressed the differentiation in a level-dependent manner, whereas elevation of input in earlier periods could not reproduce the differentiation. Thus, the capacity of neurons to drive Kv1.1 expression via auditory input develops in a cell-specific manner and directs differentiation, highlighting the importance of neuronal character as well as the level of input in the frequency tuning of auditory circuits.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/2955?rss=1">Human Sensorimotor Cortex Control of Directly Measured Vocal Tract Movements during Vowel Production</a></h4>

<p>During speech production, we make vocal tract movements with remarkable precision and speed. Our understanding of how the human brain achieves such proficient control is limited, in part due to the challenge of simultaneously acquiring high-resolution neural recordings and detailed vocal tract measurements. To overcome this challenge, we combined ultrasound and video monitoring of the supralaryngeal articulators (lips, jaw, and tongue) with electrocorticographic recordings from the cortical surface of 4 subjects (3 female, 1 male) to investigate how neural activity in the ventral sensory-motor cortex (vSMC) relates to measured articulator movement kinematics (position, speed, velocity, acceleration) during the production of English vowels. We found that high-gamma activity at many individual vSMC electrodes strongly encoded the kinematics of one or more articulators, but less so for vowel formants and vowel identity. Neural population decoding methods further revealed the structure of kinematic features that distinguish vowels. Encoding of articulator kinematics was sparsely distributed across time and primarily occurred during the time of vowel onset and offset. In contrast, encoding was low during the steady-state portion of the vowel, despite sustained neural activity at some electrodes. Significant representations were found for all kinematic parameters, but speed was the most robust. These findings enabled by direct vocal tract monitoring demonstrate novel insights into the representation of articulatory kinematic parameters encoded in the vSMC during speech production.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speaking requires precise control and coordination of the vocal tract articulators (lips, jaw, and tongue). Despite the impressive proficiency with which humans move these articulators during speech production, our understanding of how the brain achieves such control is rudimentary, in part because the movements themselves are difficult to observe. By simultaneously measuring speech movements and the neural activity that gives rise to them, we demonstrate how neural activity in sensorimotor cortex produces complex, coordinated movements of the vocal tract.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/12/2944?rss=1">Neurobiological Mechanisms of Responding to Injustice</a></h4>

<p>People are particularly sensitive to injustice. Accordingly, deeper knowledge regarding the processes that underlie the perception of injustice, and the subsequent decisions to either punish transgressors or compensate victims, is of important social value. By combining a novel decision-making paradigm with functional neuroimaging, we identified specific brain networks that are involved with both the perception of, and response to, social injustice, with reward-related regions preferentially involved in punishment compared with compensation. Developing a computational model of punishment allowed for disentangling the neural mechanisms and psychological motives underlying decisions of whether to punish and, subsequently, of how severely to punish. Results show that the neural mechanisms underlying punishment differ depending on whether one is directly affected by the injustice, or whether one is a third-party observer of a violation occurring to another. Specifically, the anterior insula was involved in decisions to punish following harm, whereas, in third-party scenarios, we found amygdala activity associated with punishment severity. Additionally, we used a pharmacological intervention using oxytocin, and found that oxytocin influenced participants' fairness expectations, and in particular enhanced the frequency of low punishments. Together, these results not only provide more insight into the fundamental brain mechanisms underlying punishment and compensation, but also illustrate the importance of taking an explorative, multimethod approach when unraveling the complex components of everyday decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The perception of injustice is a fundamental precursor to many disagreements, from small struggles at the dinner table to wasteful conflict between cultures and countries. Despite its clear importance, relatively little is known about how the brain processes these violations. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, we combine methods from neuroscience, psychology, and economics to explore the neurobiological mechanisms involved in both the perception of injustice as well as the punishment and compensation decisions that follow. Using a novel behavioral paradigm, we identified specific brain networks, developed a computational model of punishment, and found that administrating the neuropeptide oxytocin increases the administration of low punishments of norm violations in particular. Results provide valuable insights into the fundamental neurobiological mechanisms underlying social injustice.</p>

<p>Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTC or palucorcel) are currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of geographic atrophy, a late stage of macular degeneration, but how hUTC transplantation mediates vision recovery is not fully elucidated. Subretinal administration of hUTC preserves visual function in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat, a genetic model of retinal degeneration caused by <i>Mertk</i> loss of function. hUTC secrete synaptogenic and neurotrophic factors that improve the health and connectivity of the neural retina. Therefore, we investigated the progression of synapse and photoreceptor loss and whether hUTC treatment preserves photoreceptors and synaptic connectivity in the RCS rats of both sexes. We found that RCS retinas display significant deficits in synaptic development already by postnatal day 21 (P21), before the onset of photoreceptor degeneration. Subretinal transplantation of hUTC at P21 is necessary to rescue visual function in RCS rats, and the therapeutic effect is enhanced with repeated injections. Synaptic development defects occurred concurrently with morphological changes in MuÌller glia, the major perisynaptic glia in the retina. hUTC transplantation strongly diminished MuÌller glia reactivity and specifically protected the Î±2-1-containing retinal synapses, which are responsive to thrombospondin family synaptogenic proteins secreted by MuÌller glia. MuÌller glial reactivity and reduced synaptogenesis observed in RCS retinas could be recapitulated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-<i>Mertk</i> in MuÌller glia in wild-type rats. Together, our results show that hUTC transplantation supports the health of retina at least in part by preserving the functions of MuÌller glial cells, revealing a previously unknown aspect of hUTC transplantation-based therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the promising effects observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies, how subretinal human umbilical tissue-derived cell (hUTC) transplantation mediates vision improvements is not fully known. Using a rat model of retinal degeneration, the RCS rat (lacking <i>Mertk</i>), here we provide evidence that hUTC transplantation protects visual function and health by protecting photoreceptors and preserving retinal synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, we find that loss of <i>Mertk</i> function only in MuÌller glia is sufficient to impair synaptic development and cause activation of MuÌller glia. hUTC transplantation strongly attenuates the reactivity of MuÌller glia in RCS rats. These findings highlight novel cellular and molecular mechanisms within the neural retina, which underlie disease mechanisms and pinpoint MuÌller glia as a novel cellular target for hUTC transplantation.</p>

<p>Top-down and bottom-up, as well as low-level and high-level factors influence
where we fixate when viewing natural scenes. However, the importance of each of
these factors and how they interact remains a matter of debate. Here, we
disentangle these factors by analysing their influence over time. For this
purpose we develop a simple saliency model, which uses the internal
representation of a recent early spatial vision model as input and thus
measures the influence of the low-level bottom-up factor. To measure the
influence of high-level bottom-up features, we use DeepGaze II, a recent
DNN-based saliency model. To vary top-down influences, we evaluate the models
on a large Corpus dataset with a memorization task and on a large visual search
dataset. We can separate the exploration of a natural scene into three phases:
The first saccade, which follows a different narrower distribution, an initial
guided exploration characterized by a gradual broadening of the fixation
density and an equilibrium state which is reached after roughly 10 fixations.
The initial exploration and the equilibrium state target similar areas which
are determined largely top-down in the search dataset and are better predicted
on the Corpus dataset when including high-level features. In contrast, the
first fixation targets a different fixation density and contains a strong
central fixation bias, but also the strongest guidance by the image.
Nonetheless, the first fixations are better predicted by including high-level
information as early as 200ms after image onset. We conclude that any low-level
bottom-up factors are restricted to the first saccade, possibly caused by the
image onset. Later eye movements are better explained by including high-level
features, but this high-level bottom-up control can be overruled by top-down
influences.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07256">Burst Synchronization in A Scale-Free Neuronal Network with Inhibitory Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. (arXiv:1803.07256v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>We consider the Barab\'{a}si-Albert scale-free network (SFN) composed of
inhibitory bursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. This inhibitory neuronal population
has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the inhibitory
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). In previous works without iSTDP,
burst synchronization (BS) was found to appear in a range of noise intensities
for fixed synaptic inhibition strengths. Here, we investigate the effect of
iSTDP on BS by varying the noise intensity. We employ an anti-Hebbian time
window for the iSTDP update rule, in contrast to the Hebbian time window for
the excitatory STDP. A Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is thus
found to occur; good BS (with higher bursting measure) gets better via
long-term depression (LTD), while bad BS (with lower bursting measure) gets
worse via long-term potentiation (LTP). This kind of Matthew effect is in
contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). Furthermore, emergences of
LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-
and the post-synaptic burst onset times. Finally, in the presence of iSTDP we
investigate the effects of network architecture on BS by varying the symmetric
attachment degree $l^*$ and the asymmetry parameter $\Delta l$ in the SFN, and
Matthew effects in inhibitory synaptic plasticity are also found to occur by
varying $l^*$ and $\Delta l$.

<p>Idiosyncratic tendency to choose one alternative over others in the absence
of an identified reason, is a common observation in two-alternative
forced-choice experiments. It is tempting to account for it as resulting from
the (unknown) participant-specific history and thus treat it as a measurement
noise. Indeed, idiosyncratic choice biases are typically considered as
nuisance. Care is taken to account for them by adding an ad-hoc bias parameter
or by counterbalancing the choices to average them out. Here we quantify
idiosyncratic choice biases in a perceptual discrimination task and a motor
task. We report substantial and significant biases in both cases. Then, we
present theoretical evidence that even in idealized experiments, in which the
settings are symmetric, idiosyncratic choice bias is expected to emerge from
the dynamics of competing neuronal networks. We thus argue that idiosyncratic
choice bias reflects the microscopic dynamics of choice and therefore is
virtually inevitable in any comparison or decision task.

<p>Science is a crowning glory of the human spirit and its applications remain
our best hope for social progress. But there are limitations to current science
and perhaps to any science. The general mind-body problem is known to be
intractable and currently mysterious. This is one of many deep problems that
are universally agreed to be beyond the current purview of Science, including
quantum phenomena, etc. But all of these famous unsolved problems are either
remote from everyday experience (entanglement, dark matter) or are hard to even
define sharply (phenomenology, consciousness, etc.).
</p>
<p>In this note, we will consider some obvious computational problems in vision
that arise every time that we open our eyes and yet are demonstrably
incompatible with current theories of neural computation. The focus will be on
two related phenomena, known as the neural binding problem and the illusion of
a detailed stable visual world.

Thirty years ago, Neuron was launched as the first sister journal of Cell, when it became clear that neurobiology was a burgeoning field and needed a dedicated journal. Since then, Neuron has grown tremendously, both in content and scope. We are marking this anniversary with a collection of special features, including reviews and interviews, that will be rolled out throughout the year, reflecting on how far the field has come and the excitement for the future. We want to celebrate the breadth of topics covered by the journal and to honor the diversity of scientists that make up the broad neuroscience community.

Two theories continuously clash: does sleep downscale or potentiate synapses? A study in Neuron by GonzÃ¡lez-Rueda etÂ al. (2018) demonstrates overall synaptic depression during anesthesia-induced slow-wave activity. Because anesthesia is typically associated with amnesia, the question of whether slow-wave sleep potentiates or depresses cortical synapses remains open.

Social environment influences drug consumption, its persistence and evolution. Little is known regarding the influence of the presence of a peer during drug consumption and especially how the relationship between peers (familiarity and dominance) can influence drug consumption. We used here a translational and transdisciplinary approach to explore the influence of peer presence and peer familiarity in rats and humans that self-administer stimulants. In rats, cocaine intake was compared when rats were alone with intake when peers with different characteristics (familiar or not, cocaine naive or not, dominant or subordinate) were present. In humans, 77 cocaine and/or methylphenidate users were asked to detail their most recent drug use episodes and their relationship with peers present at consumption. The results show that in both humans and rats, the risk of cocaine/stimulant consumption was significantly reduced by 37% and 32%, respectively, when a peer was present. Moreover, the lowest risk of consumption was consistently observed when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar) with a further 38% and 17% risk reduction, respectively. In rats, a decreased risk of consumption was greater when the peer was cocaine naive (vs non-cocaine naive). The presence of a non-familiar and possibly drug-naive peer is the most efficient condition to diminish stimulant intake. Our results indirectly support the use of harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.

The nature of cortical plasticity in the course of learning is one of the most intriguing questions of the modern cognitive neuroscience. Aversive conditioning is a type of associative learning produced by continuous pairing of neutral and aversive stimuli. Aversive conditioning and electroencephalography together provide a good framework for expanding our knowledge about fast learning-related cortical changes. In our experiment we tested a novel paradigm to study associative learning where aversive conditioning was combined with passive oddball. We employed conditioned auditory neutral stimuli and unconditioned aversive electrical shocks and used time-frequency, connectivity and event-related potentials (ERP) analyses to explore their interaction. First, we observed changes in the cortical activity in the form of conditioning-induced multisensory integration. The integration manifested itself in (1) desynchronization of lower beta activity in the contralateral to expected electrical shocks hemisphere and (2) enhanced functional connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex in the gamma frequency band. Second, we found a larger amplitude of P3a and the late posterior positivity (LPP) components of ERP to conditioned stimuli, which may be related to increased attentional and emotional significance of these stimuli. Our results reproduced and extended previous findings about multisensory integration in classical conditioning and demonstrated the improved discriminability of ERP responses through incorporation of the oddball paradigm in associative learning.

A fundamental question in systems neuroscience is how spontaneous activity at rest is reorganized during task performance. Recent studies suggest a strong relationship between resting and task FC. Furthermore, the relationship between resting and task FC has been shown to reflect individual differences. Particularly, various studies have demonstrated that the FC has higher reliability and provides enhanced detection of individual differences while viewing natural scenes. Although the large-scale organization of FC during rest and movie-viewing conditions have been well studied in relation to individual variations, the re-organization of FC during viewing natural scenes have not been studied in depth. In this study, we used principal component analysis on FC during rest and movie-viewing condition to characterize the dimensionality of FC patterns across conditions and subjects. We found that the variations in FC patterns related to viewing natural scenes can be explained by a single component, which enables identification of the task over subjects with 100% accuracy. We showed that the FC mode associated to viewing natural scenes better reflects individual variations. Furthermore, we investigated the signatures of movie-viewing-specific functional modes in dynamic FC based on phase-locking values between brain regions. We found that the movie-specific functional mode is persistent across time; suggesting the emergence of a stable processing mode. To explain the reorganization of whole-brain FC through the changes in local dynamics, we appeal to a large-scale computational model. This modelling suggested that the reorganization of whole-brain FC is associated to the interaction between frontal-parietal and frontal-temporal activation patterns.

Astrocytes, upon activation in response to brain injury, play a critical role in protecting neurons by limiting inflammation through the excessive secretion of many soluble factors, such as, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Unfortunately, excessive CSPGs paradoxically prohibit neuronal recovery and growth, and eventually constitute a scar tissue. Many studies have attempted to overcome this barrier through various molecular approaches including the removal of inhibitory CSPGs by applying chondroitinase enzymes. In this study, we examined whether click-xylosides, which serve as primers of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis, can compete with endogenous inhibitory CSPGs for GAG assembly by serving as decoy molecules and thereby potentially reverse reactive astrocyte mediated neuronal growth inhibition. We investigated the axonal growth of hippocampal neurons in the presence of xyloside treated and untreated reactive astrocyte-conditioned media as a model recapitulating brain injury. Click-xylosides were found to interfere with the GAG biosynthetic machinery in astrocytes and reduced the amount of secreted inhibitory CSPGs by competing with endogenous assembly sites. The extent of underglycosylation was directly related to the outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. Overall, this study suggests that click-xylosides are promising therapeutic agents to treat CNS injuries and warrants further in vivo investigations.

Chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (Dup15q) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by duplications of the maternal copy of this region. In addition to hypotonia, motor deficits, and language impairments, Dup15q patients commonly meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and have a high prevalence of seizures. Here, we explored mechanisms of hyperexcitability in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from Dup15q patients. Maturation of resting membrane potential in Dup15q-derived neurons was similar to neurons from unaffected control subjects, but Dup15q neurons had delayed action potential maturation and increased synaptic event frequency and amplitude. Dup15q neurons also showed impairments in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling. Finally, Dup15q neurons showed an increased frequency of spontaneous action potential firing compared to control neurons, in part due to disruption of KCNQ2 channels. Together these data point to multiple mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability that may provide new targets for the treatment of seizures and other phenotypes associated with Dup15q.

In the developing visual system, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons project from the retina to several distal retinorecipient regions in the brain. Several molecules have been implicated in guiding RGC axons in vivo, but the role of extracellular matrix molecules in this process remains poorly understood. Dystroglycan is a laminin-binding transmembrane protein important for formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and has previously been implicated in axon guidance in the developing spinal cord. Using two genetic models of functional dystroglycan loss, we show that dystroglycan is necessary for correct sorting of contralateral and ipsilateral RGC axons at the optic chiasm. Missorted axons still target retinorecipient brain regions and persist in adult mice, even after axon pruning is complete. Our results highlight the importance of the extracellular matrix for axon sorting at an intermediate choice point in the developing visual circuit.

Diverse psychophysical and neurophysiological results show that oculomotor networks are continuously active, such that plans for making the next eye movement are always ongoing. So, when new visual information arrives unexpectedly, how are those plans affected? At what point can the new information start guiding an eye movement, and how? Here, based on modeling and simulation results, we make two observations that are relevant to these questions. First, we note that many experiments, including those investigating the phenomenon known as "saccadic inhibition," are consistent with the idea that sudden-onset stimuli briefly interrupt the gradual rise in neural activity associated with the preparation of an impending saccade. And second, we show that this stimulus-driven interruption is functionally adaptive, but only if perception is fast. In that case, putting on hold an ongoing saccade plan toward location A allows the oculomotor system to initiate a concurrent, alternative plan toward location B (where a stimulus just appeared), deliberate (briefly) on the priority of each target, and determine which plan should continue. Based on physiological data, we estimate that the actual advantage of this strategy, relative to one in which any plan once initiated must be completed, is of several tens of milliseconds.

People fluidly segment a flow of events to establish a cognitive map of the ongoing environment, a process referred to as event-segmentation. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex encode cognitive maps, in which events in temporal or spatial proximity are more similarly represented than distant events. Hippocampal and prefrontal activity is also increased with detection of a deviant event. It is unclear whether the increased activity during event-segmentation is a deviant-detection response or also represents saliency magnitude, and how these contribute to constructing cognitive maps. We studied the regional response to a naturalistic fellow of events with varying saliency magnitudes. Using intracranial electroencephalography from ten patients, we observed that high-frequency activity (HFA; 50-150 Hz) in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex tracked event saliency magnitudes. We propose that event saliency magnitude determines the contextual update for generating the cognitive map of events so that a sequence of less salient events is embedded in the context of more salient events. This dynamic contextual update can be used to generate a hierarchical map of the environment reflecting event contextual closeness.

Much of our understanding about how acetylcholine modulates prefrontal cortical (PFC) networks comes from behavioral experiments that examine cortical dynamics during highly attentive states. However, much less is known about how PFC is recruited during passive sensory processing and how acetylcholine may regulate connectivity between cortical areas outside of task performance. To investigate the involvement of PFC and cholinergic neuromodulation in passive auditory processing, we performed simultaneous recordings in the auditory cortex (AC) and PFC in awake head fixed mice presented with a white noise auditory stimulus in the presence or absence of local cholinergic antagonists in AC. We found that a subset of PFC neurons were strongly driven by auditory stimuli even when the stimulus had no associative meaning, suggesting PFC monitors stimuli under passive conditions. We also found that cholinergic signaling in AC shapes the strength of auditory driven response in PFC, by modulating the intra-cortical sensory response through muscarinic interactions in AC. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence that cholinergic mechanisms have a continuous role in cortical gating through muscarinic receptors during passive processing and expand traditional views of prefrontal cortical function and the contributions of cholinergic modulation in sensory gating.

Abstract
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains dark agouti (DA) to piebald viral glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>â</sup>), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>â</sup>), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese O<sub>2</sub><sup>â</sup> dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), decreased oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 24 h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2 h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. ONOO<sup>â</sup> was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.</p>

Rotavirus is considered a directly transmitted disease due to its high infectivity. Environmental pathways have, therefore, largely been ignored.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are important regulators of gene expression programs, especially during gametogenesis.

<p>Spiking activity of neurons engaged in learning and performing a task show
complex spatiotemporal dynamics. While the output of recurrent network models
can learn to perform various tasks, the possible range of recurrent dynamics
that emerge after learning remains unknown. Here we show that modifying the
recurrent connectivity with a recursive least squares algorithm provides
sufficient flexibility for synaptic and spiking rate dynamics of spiking
networks to produce a wide range of spatiotemporal activity. We apply the
training method to learn arbitrary firing patterns, stabilize irregular spiking
activity of a balanced network, and reproduce the heterogeneous spiking rate
patterns of cortical neurons engaged in motor planning and movement. We
identify sufficient conditions for successful learning, characterize two types
of learning errors, and assess the network capacity. Our findings show that
synaptically-coupled recurrent spiking networks possess a vast computational
capability that can support the diverse activity patterns in the brain.

A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C39wpIQO--A" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory subjective value, only a higher-order visual area represented visual subjective value. These findings expand our understanding of the Common Currency Network of the brain, and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Whether auditory information has the same impact on the value system as visual information is unknown. This is striking, given that we live in a multimodal world, and decision-making relies on evidence from all of our senses. It is well-known that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value in an abstract and common manner, which allows comparison between different options. We examined whether this representation is sensitive to the sensory modality in which options are presented. Using fMRI and a risk-evaluating task, we show that whereas sensory cortices represent value of options in a modality-specific way, the vmPFC represents value irrespective of sensory modality. This brings our understanding of the neural value system closer to choices in the real world.</p>

<p>Working memory is a cognitive process that is responsible for temporarily
holding and manipulating information. Most of the empirical neuroscience
research on working memory has focused on measuring sustained activity in
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and/or parietal cortex during simple delayed-response
tasks, and most of the models of working memory have been based on neural
integrators. But working memory means much more than just holding a piece of
information online. We describe a new theory of working memory, based on a
recurrent neural circuit that we call ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted
Neural Integrator Circuits). ORGaNICs are a variety of Long Short Term Memory
units (LSTMs), imported from machine learning and artificial intelligence.
ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of delay-period activity
in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task. The theory is
analytically tractable so that we can characterize the dynamics, and the theory
provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying
responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. ORGaNICs can
be implemented with a biophysical (electrical circuit) model of pyramidal
cells, combined with shunting inhibition via a thalamocortical loop. Although
introduced as a computational theory of working memory, ORGaNICs are also
applicable to models of sensory processing, motor preparation and motor
control. ORGaNICs offer computational advantages compared to other varieties of
LSTMs that are commonly used in AI applications. Consequently, ORGaNICs are a
framework for canonical computation in brains and machines.

<p>Our mysterious brain is believed to operate near a non-equilibrium point and
generate critical self-organized avalanches in neuronal activity. Recent
experimental evidence has revealed significant heterogeneity in both synaptic
input and output connectivity, but whether the structural heterogeneity
participates in the regulation of neuronal avalanches remains poorly
understood. By computational modelling, we predict that different types of
structural heterogeneity contribute distinct effects on avalanche
neurodynamics. In particular, neuronal avalanches can be triggered at an
intermediate level of input heterogeneity, but heterogeneous output
connectivity cannot evoke avalanche dynamics. In the criticality region, the
co-emergence of multi-scale cortical activities is observed, and both the
avalanche dynamics and neuronal oscillations are modulated by the input
heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show similar results can be reproduced in
networks with various types of in- and out-degree distributions. Overall, these
findings not only provide details on the underlying circuitry mechanisms of
nonrandom synaptic connectivity in the regulation of neuronal avalanches, but
also inspire testable hypotheses for future experimental studies.

<p>Reliable diagnosis of depressive disorder is essential for both optimal
treatment and prevention of fatal outcomes. In this study, we aimed to
elucidate the effectiveness of two non-linear measures, Higuchi Fractal
Dimension (HFD) and Sample Entropy (SampEn), in detecting depressive disorders
when applied on EEG. HFD and SampEn of EEG signals were used as features for
seven machine learning algorithms including Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines with the linear and polynomial kernel,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifier, discriminating EEG
between healthy control subjects and patients diagnosed with depression. We
confirmed earlier observations that both non-linear measures can discriminate
EEG signals of patients from healthy control subjects. The results suggest that
good classification is possible even with a small number of principal
components. Average accuracy among classifiers ranged from 90.24% to 97.56%.
Among the two measures, SampEn had better performance. Using HFD and SampEn and
a variety of machine learning techniques we can accurately discriminate
patients diagnosed with depression vs controls which can serve as a highly
sensitive, clinically relevant marker for the diagnosis of depressive
disorders.

<p>A novel approach is presented for group statistical analysis of diffusion
weighted MRI datasets through voxelwise Orientation Distribution Functions
(ODF). Recent advances in MRI acquisition make it possible to use high quality
diffusion weighted protocols (multi-shell, large number of gradient directions)
for routine in vivo study of white matter architecture. The dimensionality of
these data sets is however often reduced to simplify statistical analysis.
While these approaches may detect large group differences, they do not fully
capitalize on all acquired image volumes. Incorporation of all available
diffusion information in the analysis however risks biasing the outcome by
outliers. Here we propose a statistical analysis method operating on the ODF,
either the diffusion ODF or fiber ODF. To avoid outlier bias and reliably
detect voxelwise group differences and correlations with demographic or
behavioral variables, we apply the Low-Rank plus Sparse (L + S) matrix
decomposition on the voxelwise ODFs which separates the sparse individual
variability in the sparse matrix S whilst recovering the essential ODF features
in the low-rank matrix L. We demonstrate the performance of this ODF L + S
approach by replicating the established negative association between global
white matter integrity and physical obesity in the Human Connectome dataset.
The volume of positive findings agrees with and expands on the volume found by
TBSS, Connectivity based fixel enhancement and Connectometry. In the same
dataset we further localize the correlations of brain structure with
neurocognitive measures such as fluid intelligence and episodic memory. The
presented ODF L + S approach will aid in the full utilization of all acquired
diffusion weightings leading to the detection of smaller group differences in
clinically relevant settings as well as in neuroscience applications.

The folding of proteins with a complex knot is still an unresolved question. Based on representative members of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) that contain the 5<sub>2</sub> knot in the native state, we explain how UCHs are able to unfold and refold <i>in vitro</i> reversibly within the structure-based model. In particular, we identify two, topologically different folding/unfolding pathways and corroborate our results with experiment, recreating the chevron plot. We show that confinement effect of chaperonin or weak crowding greatly facilitates folding, simultaneously slowing down the unfolding process of UCHs, compared with bulk conditions. Finally, we analyze the existence of knots in the denaturated state of UCHs. The results of the work show that the crowded environment of the cell should have a positive effect on the kinetics of complex knotted proteins, especially when proteins with deeper knots are found in this family.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQnzANgGzpM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision-making. Human healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 21) and pathological gamblers (<i>n</i> = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counter-balanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Dopamine has been implicated in risky decision-making and gambling addiction, but the exact mechanisms underlying this influence remain partly elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine modulates subjective probability weighting, by examining the effect of a dopaminergic drug on risk-taking behavior, both in healthy individuals and pathologic gamblers. We found that selectively blocking dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptors diminished the typically observed distortion of winning probabilities, characterized by an overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities. This made participants more linear in their subjective estimation of probabilities and thus more rational in their decision-making behavior. Healthy participants and pathologic gamblers did not differ in their risk-taking behavior, except in the placebo condition in which gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0080-18.2018v1?rss=1">Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the excitatory phases of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are innervated by enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses in GI muscles. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from Ca<sup>2+</sup> intracellular stores, mediate electrophysiological events in ICC by activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. Neural responses in ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine (ICC-DMP) were studied by confocal imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in these cells. Excitatory neural input was due to cholinergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and neurokinins), as excitatory effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were blocked by atropine and neurokinin receptor antagonists. Neurokinins are the dominant excitatory regulators of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-DMP. ICC-DMP are innervated by enteric motor neurons and mediate significant excitatory responses in intestinal muscles.</p>

<p>Biological and artificial neural systems are composed of many local
processors, and their capabilities depend upon the transfer function that
relates each local processor's outputs to its inputs. This paper uses a recent
advance in the foundations of information theory to study the properties of
local processors that use contextual input to amplify or attenuate transmission
of information about their driving inputs. This advance enables the information
transmitted by processors with two distinct inputs to be decomposed into those
components unique to each input, that shared between the two inputs, and that
which depends on both though it is in neither, i.e. synergy. The decompositions
that we report here show that contextual modulation has information processing
properties that contrast with those of all four simple arithmetic operators,
that it can take various forms, and that the form used in our previous studies
of artificial neural nets composed of local processors with both driving and
contextual inputs is particularly well-suited to provide the distinctive
capabilities of contextual modulation under a wide range of conditions. We
argue that the decompositions reported here could be compared with those
obtained from empirical neurobiological and psychophysical data under
conditions thought to reflect contextual modulation. That would then shed new
light on the underlying processes involved. Finally, we suggest that such
decompositions could aid the design of context-sensitive machine learning
algorithms.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05840">Effective Connectivity from Single Trial fMRI Data by Sampling Biologically Plausible Models. (arXiv:1803.05840v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The estimation of causal network architectures in the brain is fundamental
for understanding cognitive information processes. However, access to the
dynamic processes underlying cognition is limited to indirect measurements of
the hidden neuronal activity, for instance through fMRI data. Thus, estimating
the network structure of the underlying process is challenging. In this
article, we embed an adaptive importance sampler called Adaptive Path Integral
Smoother (APIS) into the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain point
estimates of causal connectivity. We demonstrate on synthetic data that this
procedure finds not only the correct network structure but also the direction
of effective connections from random initializations of the connectivity
matrix. In addition--motivated by contradictory claims in the literature--we
examine the effect of the neuronal timescale on the sensitivity of the BOLD
signal to changes in the connectivity and on the maximum likelihood solutions
of the connectivity. We conclude with two warnings: First, the connectivity
estimates under the assumption of slow dynamics can be extremely biased if the
data was generated by fast neuronal processes. Second, the faster the time
scale, the less sensitive the BOLD signal is to changes in the incoming
connections to a node. Hence, connectivity estimation using realistic neural
dynamics timescale requires extremely high-quality data and seems infeasible in
many practical data sets.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05783">Receptive profiles induce functional architecture of V1. (arXiv:1803.05783v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>In this work we show how to construct connectivity kernels induced by the
receptive profiles of simple cells of the primary visual cortex (V1). These
kernels are directly defined by the shape of such profiles: this provides a
metric model for the functional architecture of V1, whose global geometry is
determined by the reciprocal interactions between local elements. Our
construction adapts to any bank of filters chosen to represent the set of
receptive profiles of simple cells, since it does not require any structure on
the parameterization on the family. The connectivity kernel that we define
carries a geometrical structure consistent with the well-known properties of
long-range horizontal connections in V1, and it is compatible with the
perceptual rules synthesized by the concept of association field. These
characteristics are still present when the kernel is constructed from a bank of
filters arising from an unsupervised learning algorithm.

A predominant view of perirhinal cortex (PRC) and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex (POR/PHC) function contends that these structures are tuned to represent objects and spatial information, respectively. However, known anatomical connectivity, together with recent electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion data, indicate that both brain areas participate in spatial and nonspatial processing. Instead of content-based organization, the PRC and PHC/POR may participate in two computationally distinct corticalâhippocampal networks: one network that is tuned to process coarse information quickly, forming gist-like representations of scenes/environments, and a second network tuned to process information about the specific sensory details that are necessary for discrimination across sensory modalities.

<p>by NÃºria Folguera-Blasco, Elisabet CuyÃ s, Javier A. MenÃ©ndez, TomÃ¡s AlarcÃ³n</p>

Understanding the control of epigenetic regulation is key to explain and modify the aging process. Because histone-modifying enzymes are sensitive to shifts in availability of cofactors (e.g. metabolites), cellular epigenetic states may be tied to changing conditions associated with cofactor variability. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationships between cofactor fluctuations, epigenetic landscapes, and cell state transitions. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we generate an ensemble of epigenetic regulation (ER) systems whose heterogeneity reflects variability in cofactor pools used by histone modifiers. The heterogeneity of epigenetic metabolites, which operates as regulator of the kinetic parameters promoting/preventing histone modifications, stochastically drives phenotypic variability. The ensemble of ER configurations reveals the occurrence of distinct epi-states within the ensemble. Whereas resilient states maintain large epigenetic barriers refractory to reprogramming cellular identity, plastic states lower these barriers, and increase the sensitivity to reprogramming. Moreover, fine-tuning of cofactor levels redirects plastic epigenetic states to re-enter epigenetic resilience, and vice versa. Our ensemble model agrees with a model of metabolism-responsive loss of epigenetic resilience as a cellular aging mechanism. Our findings support the notion that cellular aging, and its reversal, might result from stochastic translation of metabolic inputs into resilient/plastic cell states via ER systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O1S3sVW-8ko" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher Ebsch, Robert Rosenbaum</p>

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuitsâ connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FNF84rL9qos" width="1" />

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4â5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes "coopetition," as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with masterâs students in bioinformatics and modeling, with proteinâprotein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities. All the information and data are available at www.meet-u.org.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uLDwRntm3uo" width="1" />

<p>by Manuel Corpas, Nadezda V. Kovalevskaya, Amanda McMurray, Fiona G. G. Nielsen</p>

It is generally acknowledged that, for reproducibility and progress of human genomic research, data sharing is critical. For every sharing transaction, a successful data exchange is produced between a data consumer and a data provider. Providers of human genomic data (e.g., publicly or privately funded repositories and data archives) fulfil their social contract with data donors when their shareable data conforms to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. Based on our experiences via Repositive (https://repositive.io), a leading discovery platform cataloguing all shared human genomic datasets, we propose guidelines for data providers wishing to maximise their shared dataâs FAIRness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmCLx4LfFZo" width="1" />

<p>Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) affects the efficiency of synaptic
transmission for persistent presynaptic activities. We consider attractor
neural networks, for which the attractors are given, in the absence of STSP, by
cell assemblies of excitatory cliques. We show that STSP may transform these
attracting states into attractor relics, inducing ongoing transient-state
dynamics in terms of sequences of transiently activated cell assemblies, the
former attractors. Subsequent cell assemblies may be both disjoint or partially
overlapping. It may hence be possible to use the resulting dynamics for the
generation of motor control sequences.

<p>Modern deep learning enabled artificial neural networks, such as Deep Neural
Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have achieved a series of
breaking records on a broad spectrum of recognition applications. However, the
enormous computation and storage requirements associated with such deep and
complex neural network models greatly challenge their implementations on
resource-limited platforms. Time-based spiking neural network has recently
emerged as a promising solution in Neuromorphic Computing System designs for
achieving remarkable computing and power efficiency within a single chip.
However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly concentrated on
the biological plausibility and theoretical learning approaches, causing
inefficient neural processing and impracticable multilayer extension thus
significantly limitations on speed and accuracy when handling the realistic
cognitive tasks. In this work, a practical multilayer time-based spiking
neuromorphic architecture, namely "MT-Spike", is developed to fill this gap.
With the proposed practical time-coding scheme, average delay response model,
temporal error backpropagation algorithm, and heuristic loss function,
"MT-Spike" achieves more efficient neural processing through flexible neural
model size reduction while offering very competitive classification accuracy
for realistic recognition tasks. Simulation results well validated that the
algorithmic power of deep multi-layer learning can be seamlessly merged with
the efficiency of time-based spiking neuromorphic architecture, demonstrating
great potentials of "MT-Spike" in resource and power constrained embedded
platforms.

<p>One of the most exciting advancements in AI over the last decade is the wide
adoption of ANNs, such as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications.
However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement
greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like the
drone, mobile phone, and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural
network model--Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism
and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for
achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted
devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been
narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for
fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy
efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can
be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic
applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In
this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture,
namely "PT-Spike", is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent
hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding,
efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are
proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing
capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size
when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that "PT-Spike"
demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency
and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation when
compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network
configuration.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multifloor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here, we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multilevel gallery building and then used behavioral tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multicompartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioral priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalized representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioral and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multicompartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.</span>

Neuroscience and psychology concern memory maintenance and forgetting. Zhang etÂ al. demonstrate that learning-activated Raf/MAPK pathway actively protects labile memory for hours. This active protection, combined with suppression of Rac1-dependent active forgetting, fully blocks labile memory forgetting.

V1 layer 6 neurons receive a widespread head-motion signal that is integrated with visual input during visual-motion processing. These V1 head-motion inputs project from the retrosplenial cortex, a multisensory area involved in spatial navigation and contextual processing.

<p>by Jun Ding, James S. Hagood, Namasivayam Ambalavanan, Naftali Kaminski, Ziv Bar-Joseph</p>

The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software reconstructs dynamic regulatory networks by integrating static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data. In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been profiled when studying biological processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. Combining all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal. To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and combines them with existing interaction data to reconstruct networks that can lead to novel hypotheses on the function and timing of regulators. Users can interactively visualize and query the resulting model. We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to microglia developmental data from multiple labs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/73xX3n_LGQE" width="1" />

Measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), recorded using electroencephalography during different phases of movement, have been fundamental in understanding the neurophysiological changes related to motor control. SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings, including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes, has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing.

Two recent studies by Meltzer et al. and Ziegler et al. use Drosophila larvae to demonstrate that cell-autonomous regulation of lipid biosynthesis defines the complexity and function of highly branched nociceptive neurons. Their findings show that lipid biosynthesis in the neuron is fine-tuned for optimal dendrite morphology and sensitivity.

Current antiaging strategies focusing on druggable targets have met with relatively limited success to date. Replacement of cells, tissues, and organs could provide an alternative means for targeting age-induced damage and potentially eliminating some of it. However, before this is a viable option, numerous challenges need to be addressed. Most notably, whether the brain, which defines our self-identity, is amenable to replacement therapies is unclear. Here, we consider whether progressive cell replacement is a potential approach to reverse brain aging without grossly altering function.

<p>by Stefan Gahbauer, Kristyna Pluhackova, Rainer A. BÃ¶ckmann</p>

Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), play essential roles in the human immune system, they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in HIV-infection. A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 modulate receptor function. In addition, membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. Here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hs4EV4VzCNk" width="1" />

<p>by Jinbo Chen, Uwe Scholz, Ruonan Zhou, Matthias Lange</p>

In order to access and filter content of life-science databases, full text search is a widely applied query interface. But its high flexibility and intuitiveness is paid for with potentially imprecise and incomplete query results. To reduce this drawback, query assistance systems suggest those combinations of keywords with the highest potential to match most of the relevant data records. Widespread approaches are syntactic query corrections that avoid misspelling and support expansion of words by suffixes and prefixes. Synonym expansion approaches apply thesauri, ontologies, and query logs. All need laborious curation and maintenance. Furthermore, access to query logs is in general restricted. Approaches that infer related queries by their query profile like research field, geographic location, co-authorship, affiliation etc. require userâs registration and its public accessibility that contradict privacy concerns. To overcome these drawbacks, we implemented LAILAPS-QSM, a machine learning approach that reconstruct possible linguistic contexts of a given keyword query. The context is referred from the text records that are stored in the databases that are going to be queried or extracted for a general purpose query suggestion from PubMed abstracts and UniProt data. The supplied tool suite enables the pre-processing of these text records and the further computation of customized distributed word vectors. The latter are used to suggest alternative keyword queries. An evaluated of the query suggestion quality was done for plant science use cases. Locally present experts enable a cost-efficient quality assessment in the categories trait, biological entity, taxonomy, affiliation, and metabolic function which has been performed using ontology term similarities. LAILAPS-QSM mean information content similarity for 15 representative queries is 0.70, whereas 34% have a score above 0.80. In comparison, the information content similarity for human expert made query suggestions is 0.90. The software is either available as tool set to build and train dedicated query suggestion services or as already trained general purpose RESTful web service. The service uses open interfaces to be seamless embeddable into database frontends. The JAVA implementation uses highly optimized data structures and streamlined code to provide fast and scalable response for web service calls.

<p>by Hao Ge, Pingping Wu, Hong Qian, Xiaoliang Sunney Xie</p>

Within an isogenic population, even in the same extracellular environment, individual cells can exhibit various phenotypic states. The exact role of stochastic gene-state switching regulating the transition among these phenotypic states in a single cell is not fully understood, especially in the presence of positive feedback. Recent high-precision single-cell measurements showed that, at least in bacteria, switching in gene states is slow relative to the typical rates of active transcription and translation. Hence using the <i>lac</i> operon as an archetype, in such a region of operon-state switching, we present a fluctuating-rate model for this classical gene regulation module, incorporating the more realistic operon-state switching mechanism that was recently elucidated. We found that the positive feedback mechanism induces bistability (referred to as deterministic bistability), and that the parameter range for its occurrence is significantly broadened by stochastic operon-state switching. We further show that in the absence of positive feedback, operon-state switching must be extremely slow to trigger bistability by itself. However, in the presence of positive feedback, which stabilizes the induced state, the relatively slow operon-state switching kinetics within the physiological region are sufficient to stabilize the uninduced state, together generating a broadened parameter region of bistability (referred to as stochastic bistability). We illustrate the opposite phenotype-transition rate dependence upon the operon-state switching rates in the two types of bistability, with the aid of a recently proposed rate formula for fluctuating-rate models. The rate formula also predicts a maximal transition rate in the intermediate region of operon-state switching, which is validated by numerical simulations in our model. Overall, our findings suggest a biological function of transcriptional âvariationsâ among genetically identical cells, for the emergence of bistability and transition between phenotypic states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYGTBzywAD4" width="1" />

<p>by Guillaume Pernelle, Wilten Nicola, Claudia Clopath</p>

Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap junction coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network based on recent experimental findings. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fShLgpxE30I" width="1" />

<p>by Michael Pablo, Samuel A. Ramirez, Timothy C. Elston</p>

Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ccfBadz21A" width="1" />

<p>by James Elber Duverger, Vincent Jacquemet, Alain Vinet, Philippe Comtois</p>

The biological pacemaker approach is an alternative to cardiac electronic pacemakers. Its main objective is to create pacemaking activity from added or modified distribution of spontaneous cells in the myocardium. This paper aims to assess how automaticity strength of pacemaker cells (i.e. their ability to maintain robust spontaneous activity with fast rate and to drive neighboring quiescent cells) and structural linear anisotropy, combined with density and spatial distribution of pacemaker cells, may affect the macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker. A stochastic algorithm was used to randomly distribute pacemaker cells, with various densities and spatial distributions, in a semi-continuous mathematical model. Simulations of the model showed that stronger automaticity allows onset of spontaneous activity for lower densities and more homogeneous spatial distributions, displayed more central foci, less variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for similar spatial patterns, but more variability in those same variables for dissimilar spatial patterns. Compared their isotropic counterparts, <i>in silico</i> anisotropic monolayers had less central foci and displayed more variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for both similar and dissimilar spatial patterns. The present study established a link between microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker, and may provide crucial information for optimized biological pacemaker therapies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LN7ks_yuF74" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex, the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> A primary function of the brain is to predict future events. Brain regions regulating anticipation of drugs have received little analysis. We studied methamphetamine anticipation in mice living in their home cage and having access to nebulized methamphetamine for 1hr daily via a tunnel to a nebulizing chamber. Mice spontaneously awakened from sleep ~2hr before methamphetamine availability and voluntarily entered the chamber when accessible. This protocol avoided the potential CNS effects associated with handling, injections and surgery. c-FOS expression before methamphetamine availability was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that anticipation of regularly scheduled methamphetamine is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.</p>

Abstract
<p>Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. In mammals, FF and FB are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. FB is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics in multiple mammalian species. This suggests FB serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of FB in these brains is not established. Here, we studied FB in the fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. We analyzed the data using Granger causality (GC), the first application of this analysis technique to recordings from the insect brain. Our analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1â5 Hz) mediated FB from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10â45 Hz) mediated FF in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced FB. Our results imply that the spectral characteristics of FF and FB may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains that is conserved from insects to mammals. We speculate that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness across species by targeting the mechanisms that support FB.</p>

Abstract<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 Â± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (N = 226, 32.97 Â± 8.36 ng/ml SD, p = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. Whilst no association was observed with gender, a weak, <i>positive</i> correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The presence of BDNF in human blood has generated considerable interest as illustrated by the very large number of publications associating BDNF levels with various conditions affecting brain function, including depression and neurodegeneration. Yet a range of technical issues, together with a lack of plausible mechanisms explaining this association, raise questions as to the meaning and value of such measurements. This contribution deals with the feasibility of reliably measuring BDNF levels in human serum and gives indications of the size of cohorts to be recruited for meaningful differences to be observed between populations of interest.</p>

Abstract<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains Dark Agouti (DA) to Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5, decreased oxidative stress markers 3-Nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase release after 24h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. Peroxynitrite was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. iNOS was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurotrauma leads to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. The outcome differs between individuals and it is largely unknown what causes this diversity. It is possible that the brain phenotype is linked to oxidative stress levels, and that some individuals acquire less oxidative stress than others. We therefore tested the oxidative stress reaction patterns in rat neurons from two strains with different susceptibility to inflammation. We found that the phenotypes have different regulation of antioxidative enzymes and oxidative stress. While further studies are needed to corroborate the findings <i>in vivo</i>, it is a proof of concept of genetic regulation of direct oxidative stress, which may impact outcome after TBI and interact with future antioxidative treatment trials.</p>

Neurons are dynamic cells that respond and adapt to stimuli throughout their long postmitotic lives. The structural and functional plasticity of neurons requires the regulated transcription of new gene products, and dysregulation of transcription in either the developing or adult brain impairs cognition. We discuss how mechanisms of chromatin regulation help to orchestrate the transcriptional programs that underlie the maturation of developing neurons and the plasticity of adult neurons. We review how chromatin regulation acts locally to modulate the expression of specific genes and more broadly to coordinate gene expression programs during transitions between cellular states.

Post-translational modification of substrate proteins by SUMO conjugation regulates a diverse array of cellular processes. While predominantly a nuclear protein modification, there is a growing appreciation that SUMOylation of proteins outside the nucleus plays direct roles in controlling synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and adaptive responses to cell stress. Furthermore, alterations in protein SUMOylation are observed in a wide range of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and several extranuclear disease-associated proteins have been shown to be directly SUMOylated.

<p>To understand the hippocampus, it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies (MBs) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP). These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to RSP. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular RSP (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral MBs. Within the granular RSP, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep Layer II and Layer III. This retrosplenial termination site colocalized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the RSP and the MBs present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the MBs and RSP are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.</p>

<p>Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces participantsâ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On "social" trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0315-17.2018?rss=1">Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Attention</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>Behaviorally, it is well established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate functional MRI (fMRI) decoding, and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observersâ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participantsâ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting neurometric functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a regionâs preferred auditory (or visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participantsâ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).</p>

Abstract
<p>Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool, namely, D2 autoreceptors, we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, <i>n</i> = 19 and controls, <i>n</i> = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0197-17.2018?rss=1">Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations, or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the "common variantâsmall effect" model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns, respectively, explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.</p>

Abstract
<p>Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given one week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock; IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 h after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a PL to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS one week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long-term effects associated with ketamine.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Î²-Catenin has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with synaptic plasticity and dendritic arborization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs containing about 22 nucleotides and involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological process, but their roles in MDD remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of miRNAs in the mouse model of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The regulation of Î²-catenin by selected miRNA was validated by silico prediction, target gene luciferase reporter assay, and transfection experiment in neurons. We demonstrated that the levels of miR-214-3p, which targets Î²-catenin transcripts were significantly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of CSDS mice. Antagomir-214-3p, a neutralizing inhibitor of miR-214-3p, increased the levels of Î²-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behavior in CSDS mice. Meanwhile, antagomir-214-3p increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and the number of dendritic spines in mPFC of CSDS mice, which may be related to the elevated expression of <span style="font-style: italic;">cldn1</span>. Furthermore, intranasal administered antagomir-214-3p also significantly increased the level of Î²-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behaviors in CSDS mice. These results may represent a new therapeutic target for MDD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major functional magnetic resonance imaging method to study network organization of human brains. There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (âdynamic FCâ) because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional âstaticâ FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21 in humans. NCAM2 accumulates in synapses, but its role in regulation of synapse formation remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that an increase in NCAM2 levels results in increased instability of dendritic protrusions and reduced conversion of protrusions to dendritic spines in mouse cortical neurons. NCAM2 overexpression induces an increase in the frequency of submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes localized in individual dendritic protrusions and promotes propagation of submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes over segments of dendrites or the whole dendritic tree. NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent, and their propagation but not initiation depends on the c-Src protein tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of initiation or propagation of NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes reduces the NCAM2-dependent instability of dendritic protrusions. Synaptic boutons formed on dendrites of neurons with elevated NCAM2 expression are enriched in the protein marker of immature synapses GAP43, and the number of boutons with mature activity-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling is reduced. Our results indicate that synapse maturation is inhibited in NCAM2-overexpressing neurons and suggest that changes in NCAM2 levels and altered submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics can cause defects in synapse maturation in Down syndrome and other brain disorders associated with abnormal NCAM2 expression.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Buffer versus embedded processes accounts of short-term memory (STM) for phonological information were addressed by testing subjectsâ perception and memory for speech and non-speech auditory stimuli. Univariate and multivariate (MVPA) approaches were used to assess whether brain regions recruited in recognizing speech were involved in maintaining speech representations over a delay. As expected, a left superior temporal region was found to support speech perception. However, contrary to the embedded processes approach, this region failed to show a load effect, or any sustained activation, during a maintenance delay. Moreover, MVPA decoding during the maintenance stage was unsuccessful in this region by a perception classifier or an encoding classifier. In contrast, the left supramarginal gyrus showed both sustained activation and a load effect. Using MVPA, stimulus decoding was successful during the delay period. In addition, a functional connectivity analysis showed that, as memory load increased, the left temporal lobe involved in perception became more strongly connected with the parietal region involved in maintenance. Taken together, the findings provide greater support for a buffer than embedded processes account of phonological STM.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While graph theoretical modeling has dramatically advanced our understanding of complex brain systems, the feasibility of aggregating connectomic data in large imaging consortia remains unclear. Here, using a battery of cognitive, emotional and resting fMRI paradigms, we investigated the generalizability of functional connectomic measures across sites and sessions. Our results revealed overall fair to excellent reliability for a majority of measures during both rest and tasks, in particular for those quantifying connectivity strength, network segregation and network integration. Processing schemes such as node definition and global signal regression (GSR) significantly affected resulting reliability, with higher reliability detected for the Power atlas (vs. AAL atlas) and data without GSR. While network diagnostics for default-mode and sensori-motor systems were consistently reliable independently of paradigm, those for higher-order cognitive systems were reliable predominantly when challenged by task. In addition, based on our present sample and after accounting for observed reliability, satisfactory statistical power can be achieved in multisite research with sample size of approximately 250 when the effect size is moderate or larger. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of brain functional graphs in large consortia, and encourage the aggregation of connectomic measures using multisite and multisession data.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0412-17.2018v1?rss=1">Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, but Not Human Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (<i>Grm2</i>), mGluR3 (<i>Grm3</i>), and TRPV1 (<i>Trpv1</i>). The majority of <i>Trpv1</i>+ mouse and human sensory neurons expressed <i>Grm2</i> and/or <i>Grm3</i>, and in both mouse and human, <i>Grm2</i> was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than <i>Grm3</i>. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE<sub>2</sub>. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.</p>
