              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep promoting neurons remodel their response properties to calibrate sleep drive with environmental demands.</a></h4>

              
                Falling asleep at the wrong time can place an individual at risk of immediate physical harm. However, not sleeping degrades cognition and adaptive behavior. To understand how animals match sleep need with environmental demands, we used live-brain imaging to examine the physiological response properties of the Drosophila sleep homeostat (dFB) following interventions that modify sleep (sleep deprivation, starvation, time-restricted feeding, memory consolidation). We report that dFB neurons can distinguish between different types of waking and can change their physiological response-properties accordingly. That is, dFB neurons are not simply passive components of a hard-wired circuit. Rather, the dFB neurons themselves can determine their response to the activity from upstream circuits. Finally, we show that the dFB appears to contain a memory trace of prior exposure to metabolic challenges induced by starvation or time-restricted feeding. Together these data highlight that the sleep homeostat is plastic and suggests an underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An extended amygdala-midbrain circuit controlling cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety and reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                While midbrain dopamine (DA) neuronal circuits are central to motivated behaviors, much remains unknown about our knowledge of how these circuits are modified over time by experience to facilitate selective aspects of experience-dependent plasticity. Most studies of the DA system in drug addiction focus on the role of the mesolimbic DA pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in facilitating drug-associated reward. In contrast, less is known about how midbrain DA cells and associated circuits contribute to negative affective states including anxiety that emerge during protracted withdrawal from drug administration. Here, we demonstrate the selective role of a midbrain DA projection to the amygdala (VTADA-Amygdala) for anxiety that develops during protracted withdrawal from cocaine administration but does not participate in cocaine reward or sensitization. Our rabies virus-mediated circuit mapping approach revealed a persistent elevation in spontaneous and task-related activity of GABAergic cells from the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) and downstream VTADA-Amygdala cells that could be detected even after a single cocaine exposure. Activity in BNSTGABA cells was related to cocaine-induced anxiety but not reward or sensitization, and silencing the projection from these cells to the midbrain was sufficient to prevent the development of anxiety during protracted withdrawal following cocaine administration. We observed that VTADA-Amygdala cells, but not other midbrain DA cells, were strongly activated after a challenge exposure to cocaine, and found that activity in these cells was necessary for the expression of reinstatement of cocaine place preference. Lastly, the importance of activity in VTADA-Amygdala cells extends beyond cocaine, as these cells mediate the development of anxiety states triggered by morphine and a predator odor. Our results provide an exemplar for how to identify key circuit substrates that contribute to behavioral adaptations and reveal a critical role for BNSTGABA-VTADA-Amygdala pathway in anxiety states induced by drugs of abuse or natural experiences as well as cocaine-primed reinstatement of conditioned place preference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine neuron morphology and output are differentially controlled by mTORC1 and mTORC2</a></h4>

              
                The mTOR pathway is an essential regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties and whether they act together or independently is unknown. Here we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. As mTOR is involved in several brain disorders caused by dopaminergic dysregulation including Parkinson's disease and addiction, our results have implications for understanding the pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategies for these diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NMDA receptor-targeted enrichment of CaMKIIα improves fear memory</a></h4>

              
                Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII) is an essential player in long-term potentiation and memory formation. However, the establishment of effective molecular interventions with CaMKII to improve memory remains a long-standing challenge. Here we report a novel intrabody targeting GluN1, a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We identify this anti-GluN1 intrabody (termed VHH Anti-GluN1; VHHAN1) by a synthetic phage display library selection and yeast-two-hybrid screenings. We validate specific targeting of VHHAN1 to GluN1 in heterologous cells and the mouse hippocampus. We further show that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of CaMKII fused with VHHAN1 is locally enriched at excitatory postsynaptic regions of the mouse hippocampus. We also find that the AAV- and VHHAN1-mediated postsynaptic enrichment of CaMKII in the hippocampus improves contextual fear memory in mice. This novel approach opens a new avenue to enhance memory ability in health and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gabra5LHA Mediate Astrocytic GABA-induced Obesity via Decreasing Energy Expenditure</a></h4>

              
                The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Although LHA neurons innervate adipose tissues, the identity of neurons that regulate fat is undefined. Here we identify that Gabra5-positive neurons in LHA (Gabra5LHA) polysynaptically project to brown and white adipose tissues in the periphery. Gabra5LHA are a distinct subpopulation of GABAergic neurons and show decreased pacemaker firing in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Gene silencing of Gabra5 in LHA decreases weight gain, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of LHA suppresses energy expenditure and increases weight gain. In DIO mouse model, Gabra5LHA are tonically inhibited by nearby reactive astrocytes releasing GABA, which is synthesized by MAOB. Administration of a MAOB inhibitor, KDS2010 reduces weight gain significantly without affecting food intake, which is recapitulated by gene-silencing of astrocytic MAOB in LHA. We propose that firing of Gabra5LHA facilitates energy expenditure and selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA is a molecular target for treating obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Determinants of functional synaptic connectivity among amygdala-projecting prefrontal cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates a variety of complex cognitive functions via its vast and diverse connections with cortical and subcortical structures. Understanding the patterns of synaptic connectivity that comprise the mPFC local network is crucial for deciphering how this circuit processes information and relays it to downstream structures. To elucidate the synaptic organization of the mPFC, we developed a high-throughput optogenetic method for mapping large-scale functional synaptic connectivity. We show that mPFC neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala display unique spatial patterns of local-circuit synaptic connectivity within the mPFC, which distinguish them from the general mPFC cell population. Moreover, the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic mPFC cell and anatomical position of both cells jointly account for ~7.5% of the variation in probability of connection between mPFC neurons, with anatomical distance and laminar position explaining most of this fraction in variation. Our findings demonstrate a functional segregation of mPFC excitatory neuron subnetworks, and reveal the factors determining connectivity in the mPFC.

                Sleep need drives sleep and plays a key role in homeostatic regulation of sleep. So far sleep need can only be inferred by animal behaviors and indicated by electroencephalography (EEG). Here we report that threonine 221 (T221) of the salt inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) was important for the catalytic activity and stability of SIK3. T221 phosphorylation in the mouse brain indicates sleep need: more sleep resulting in less phosphorylation and less sleep more phosphorylation during daily sleep/wake cycle and after sleep deprivation (SD). Sleep need was reduced in SIK3 loss of function (LOF) mutants and by T221 mutation to alanine (T221A). Sleep rebound after SD was also decreased in SIK3 LOF and T221A mutant mice. Other kinases such as SIK1 and SIK2 or other sites in SIK3 do not fulfil criteria to be both an indicator and a controller of sleep need. Our results reveal SIK3 T221 phosphorylation as the first and only chemical modification which indicates and controls sleep need.

	<p>The thromboembolic ischemia model is one of the most applicable for studying ischemic stroke in humans. The aim of this study was to develop a novel thromboembolic stroke model, allowing, by affordable tools, to reproduce cerebral infarction in rats. In the experimental group, the left common carotid artery, external carotid artery, and pterygopalatine branch of maxillary artery were ligated. A blood clot that was previously formed (during a 20 min period, in a catheter and syringe, by mixing with a thromboplastin solution and CaCl2) was injected into the left internal carotid artery. After 10 min, the catheter was removed, and the incision was sutured. The neurological status of the animals was evaluated using a 20-point scale. Histological examination of brain tissue was performed 6, 24, 72 h, and 6 days post-stroke. All groups showed motor and behavioral disturbances 24 h after surgery, which persisted throughout the study period. A histological examination revealed necrotic foci of varying severity in the cortex and subcortical regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere, for all experimental groups. A decrease in the density of hippocampal pyramidal neurons was revealed. Compared with existing models, the proposed ischemic stroke model significantly reduces surgical time, does not require an expensive operating microscope, and consistently reproduces brain infarction in the area of the middle cerebral artery supply.</p>

	<p>Alcohol addiction is regarded as a series of dynamic changes to neural circuitries. A comparison of the global network during different stages of alcohol addiction could provide an efficient way to understand the neurobiological basis of addiction. Two animal models (P-rats screened from an alcohol preference family, and NP-rats screened from an alcohol non-preference family) were trained for alcohol preference with a two-bottle free choice method for 4 weeks. To examine the changes in the neural response to alcohol during the development of alcohol preference and acute stimulation, different trials were studied with resting-state fMRI methods during different periods of alcohol preference. The correlation coefficients of 28 regions in the whole brain were calculated, and the results were compared for alcohol preference related to the genetic background/training association. The variety of coherence patterns was highly related to the state and development of alcohol preference. We observed significant special brain connectivity changes during alcohol preference in P-rats. The comparison between the P- and NP-rats highlighted the role of genetic background in alcohol preference. The results of this study support the alterations of the neural network connection during the formation of alcohol preference and confirm that alcohol preference is highly related to the genetic background. This study could provide an effective approach for understanding the neurobiological basis of alcohol addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">miR‐146b protects the perinatal brain against microglia‐induced hypomyelination</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>In the premature newborn, perinatal inflammation mediated by microglia contributes significantly to neurodevelopmental injuries including white matter injury (WMI). Brain inflammation alters development through neuroinflammatory processes mediated by activation of homeostatic microglia toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype. Investigating immune regulators of microglial activation is crucial to find effective strategies to prevent and treat WMI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><i>Ex vivo</i> microglial cultures and a mouse model of WMI induced by perinatal inflammation (interleukin-1-beta, IL-1β; postnatal day 1–5) were used to uncover and elucidate the role of microRNA-146b-5p in microglial activation and WMI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A specific reduction <i>in vivo</i> in microglia of <i>Dicer</i>, a protein required for microRNAs maturation, reduces pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and prevents hypomyelination in our model of WMI. Microglial miRNome analysis in the WMI model identified miRNA-146b-5p as a candidate modulator of microglial activation. <i>Ex vivo</i> microglial cell culture treated with the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to overexpression of immunomodulatory miRNA-146b-5p but its drastic reduction in the microglial extracellular vesicles (EVs). To increase miR-146b-5p expression, we employed a 3DNA nanocarrier to deliver synthetic miR-146b-5p specifically to microglia. Enhancing microglial miR-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased LPS-induced activation, down-regulated IRAK1 and restored miRNA-146b-5p levels in EVs. In our WMI model, 3DNA miR-146b-5p treatment significantly prevented microglial activation, hypomyelination and cognitive defect induced by perinatal inflammation.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These findings support that miR-146b-5p is a major regulator of microglia phenotype and could be targeted to reduce the incidence and the severity of perinatal brain injuries and their long-term consequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Optimal surgical extent for memory and seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postoperative memory decline is an important consequence of anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the extent of resection may be a modifiable factor. This study aimed to define optimal resection margins for cognitive outcome while maintaining a high rate of postoperative seizure freedom.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study evaluated the resection extent on postoperative structural MRI using automated voxel-based methods and manual measurements in 142 consecutive patients with unilateral drug refractory TLE (74 left, 68 right TLE) who underwent standard ATLR.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxel-wise analyses revealed that postsurgical verbal memory decline correlated with resections of the posterior hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, whereas larger resections of the fusiform gyrus were associated with worsening of visual memory in left TLE. Limiting the posterior extent of left hippocampal resection to 55% reduced the odds of significant postoperative verbal memory decline by a factor of 8.1 (95% CI 1.5-44.4, p=0.02). Seizure freedom was not related to posterior resection extent, but to the piriform cortex removal after left ATLR. In right TLE, variability of the posterior extent of resection was not associated with verbal and visual memory decline or seizures after surgery.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The extent of surgical resection is an independent and modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and seizures after left ATLR. Adapting the posterior extent of left ATLR might optimize postoperative outcome, with reduced risk of memory impairment while maintaining comparable seizure-freedom rates. The current, more lenient, approach might be appropriate for right ATLR.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">MicroRNA regulation of critical retinal pigment epithelial functions</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs are short, evolutionarily conserved noncoding RNAs that are critical for the control of normal cellular physiology. In the retina, photoreceptors are highly specialized neurons that transduce light into electrical signals. Photoreceptors, however, are unable to process visual stimuli without the support of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE performs numerous functions to aid the retina, including the generation of visual chromophore and metabolic support. Recent work has underscored how microRNAs enable vision through their contributions to RPE functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association of cochlear outer hair cell - type II spiral ganglion afferents with protection from noise-induced hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent feedback circuit projecting to the cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) confers protection from noise-induced hearing loss and is generally thought to be driven by inner hair cell (IHC) - type I spiral ganglion afferent (SGN) input. Knockout of the Prph gene (PrphKO) encoding the peripherin type III intermediate filament disrupted the OHC - type II SGN innervation and virtually eliminated MOC - mediated contralateral suppression from noise delivered to the opposite ear, measured as a reduction in cubic distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Electrical stimulation of the MOC pathway elicited contralateral suppression indistinguishable between wildtype (WT) and PrphKO mice, indicating that the loss of contralateral suppression was not due to disruption of the efferent arm of the circuit; IHC - type I SGN input was also normal, based on auditory brainstem responses. High-intensity, broadband noise (108 dB SPL, 1 hour) produced permanent hearing loss in PrphKO mice, but not in WT littermates. These findings associate OHC-type II input with MOC efferent - based otoprotection at loud sound levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cytoskeletal assembly in axonal outgrowth and regeneration analyzed on the nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                The axonal cytoskeleton is organized in a highly periodic structure, the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), which is essential to maintain the structure and function of the axon. Here, we use stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) of primary rat cortical neurons in microfluidic chambers to analyze the temporal and spatial sequence of MPS formation at the distal end of growing axons and during regeneration after axotomy. We demonstrate that the MPS does not extend continuously into the growing axon but develops from patches of periodic {beta}-spectrin II arrangements that grow and coalesce into a continuous scaffold. We estimate that the underlying sequence of nucleation, elongation, and subsequent coalescence of periodic {beta}-spectrin II patches takes around 15 hours. Strikingly, we find that development of the MPS occurs faster in regenerating axons after axotomy and note marked differences in the morphology of the growth cone and adjacent axonal regions between regenerating and unlesioned axons. Moreover, we find that inhibition of the spectrin-cleaving enzyme calpain accelerates MPS formation in regenerating axons and increases the number of regenerating axons after axotomy. Taken together, we provide here a detailed nanoscale analysis of MPS development in growing axons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Octopamine drives honeybee thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                In times of environmental change species have two options to survive: they either relocate to a new habitat or they adapt to the altered environment. Adaptation requires physiological plasticity and provides a selection benefit. In this regard, the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) protrudes with its thermoregulatory capabilities, which enables a nearly worldwide distribution. Especially in the cold, shivering thermogenesis enables foraging as well as proper brood development and thus survival. In this study, we present octopamine signaling as a neurochemical prerequisite for honeybee thermogenesis: we were able to induce hypothermia by depleting octopamine in the flight muscles. Additionally, we could restore the ability to increase body temperature by administering octopamine. Thus we conclude, that octopamine is necessary and sufficient for thermogenesis. Moreover, we show that these effects are mediated by {beta} octopamine receptors. The significance of our results is highlighted by the fact the respective receptor genes underlie enormous selective pressure due to adaptation to cold climates. Finally, octopamine signaling in the service of thermogenesis might be a key strategy to survive in a changing environment.

	<p>Diagnostic and screening tests may have risks such as misdiagnosis, as well as the potential benefits of correct diagnosis. Effective communication of this risk to both clinicians and patients can be problematic. The purpose of this study was to develop a metric called the “efficiency index” (EI), defined as the ratio of test accuracy and inaccuracy, to evaluate screening tests for dementia. This measure was compared with a previously described “likelihood to be diagnosed or misdiagnosed” (LDM), also based on “numbers needed” metrics. Datasets from prospective pragmatic test accuracy studies examining four brief cognitive screening instruments (Mini-Mental State Examination; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Mini-Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (MACE); and Free-Cog) were analysed to calculate values for EI and LDM, and to examine their variation with test cut-off for MACE and dementia prevalence. EI values were also calculated using a modification of McGee’s heuristic for the simplification of likelihood ratios to estimate percentage change in diagnostic probability. The findings indicate that EI is easier to calculate than LDM and, unlike LDM, may be classified either qualitatively or quantitatively in a manner similar to likelihood ratios. EI shows the utility or inutility of diagnostic and screening tests, illustrating the inevitable trade-off between diagnosis and misdiagnosis. It may be a useful metric to communicate risk in a way that is easily intelligible for both clinicians and patients.</p>

	<p>Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) refers to a phenomenon whereby a classically conditioned stimulus (CS) impacts the motivational salience of instrumental behavior. We examined behavioral response patterns and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based effective connectivity during an avoidance-based PIT task. Eleven participants (8 females; Mage = 28.2, SD = 2.8, range = 25–32 years) completed the task. Effective connectivity between a priori brain regions engaged during the task was determined using hemodynamic response function group iterative multiple model estimation (HRF-GIMME). Participants exhibited behavior that was suggestive of specific PIT, a CS previously associated with a reinforcing outcome increased instrumental responding directed at the same outcome. We did not find evidence for general PIT; a CS did not significantly increase instrumental responding towards a different but related outcome. Using HRF-GIMME, we recovered effective connectivity maps among corticostriatal circuits engaged during the task. Group-level paths revealed directional effects from left putamen to right insula and from right putamen to right cingulate. Importantly, a direct effect of specific PIT stimuli on blood–oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the left putamen was found. Results provide initial evidence of effective connectivity in key brain regions in an avoidance-based PIT task network. This study adds to the literature studying PIT effects in humans and employing GIMME models to understand how psychological phenomena are supported in the brain.</p>

	<p>We investigated the role of the human medio-temporal complex (hMT+) in the memory encoding and storage of a sequence of four coherently moving random dot kinematograms (RDKs), by applying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during an early or late phase of the retention interval. Moreover, in a second experiment, we also tested whether disrupting the functional integrity of hMT+ during the early phase impaired the precision of the encoded motion directions. Overall, results showed that both recognition accuracy and precision were worse in middle serial positions, suggesting the occurrence of primacy and recency effects. We found that rTMS delivered during the early (but not the late) phase of the retention interval was able to impair not only recognition of RDKs, but also the precision of the retained motion direction. However, such impairment occurred only for RDKs presented in middle positions along the presented sequence, where performance was already closer to chance level. Altogether these findings suggest an involvement of hMT+ in the memory encoding of visual motion direction. Given that both position sequence and rTMS modulated not only recognition but also the precision of the stored information, these findings are in support of a model of visual short-term memory with a variable resolution of each stored item, consistent with the assigned amount of memory resources, and that such item-specific memory resolution is supported by the functional integrity of area hMT+.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease which gives a person a high risk of becoming care-dependent. During disease progression, the amount of care concerning activities of daily living can increase, possibly resulting in transition of the people with Parkinson’s disease (PwP) to a care facility. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the factors leading to institutionalization of PwP and the consequences for them and their informal caregivers. The aim of this cross-sectional retrospective study was to investigate reasons leading to the transition into an institutional care facility, the process of decision-making and its effects on PwP symptoms and caregiver burden. Participating PwP had to be institutionalized for at most one year after transition at study inclusion. Participants completed a range of semiquantitative questionnaires as well as the caregiving tasks questionnaire. Fourteen patient–caregiver pairs were included. PwP suffered from late-stage PD symptoms with high dependence on help, experiencing several hospitalizations before transition. Analyses revealed a significant decrease in caregiver burden and depressive symptoms of the caregivers after PwP institutionalization. Factors influencing the transition were, e.g., fear of PwP health issues and concerns about caregivers’ health. This study presents new insights into the process of institutionalization and its influence on caregiver burden, including aspects for discussions of physicians with PwP and their caregivers for counselling the decision to move to institutional care.</p>

	<p>Parinaud’s syndrome involves dysfunction of the structures of the dorsal midbrain. We investigated the pathophysiology related to the signs and symptoms to better understand the symptoms of Parinaud’s syndrome: diplopia, blurred vision, visual field defects, ptosis, squint, and ataxia, and Parinaud’s main signs of upward gaze paralysis, upper eyelid retraction, convergence retraction nystagmus (CRN), and pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils. In upward gaze palsy, three structures are disrupted: the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), interstitial nucleus of Cajal (iNC), and the posterior commissure. In CRN, there is a continuous discharge of the medial rectus muscle because of the lack of inhibition of supranuclear fibers. In Collier’s sign, the posterior commissure and the iNC are mainly involved. In the vicinity of the iNC, there are two essential groups of cells, the M-group cells and central caudal nuclear (CCN) group cells, which are important for vertical gaze, and eyelid control. Overstimulation of the M group of cells and increased firing rate of the CCN group causing eyelid retraction. External compression of the posterior commissure, and pretectal area causes pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils. Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils constrict to accommodation and have a slight response to light (miosis) as opposed to Argyll Robertson pupils were there is no response to a light stimulus. In Parinaud’s syndrome patients conserve a slight response to light because an additional pathway to a pupillary light response that involves attention to a conscious bright/dark stimulus. Diplopia is mainly due to involvement of the trochlear nerve (IVth cranial nerve. Blurry vision is related to accommodation problems, while the visual field defects are a consequence of chronic papilledema that causes optic neuropathy. Ptosis in Parinaud’s syndrome is caused by damage to the oculomotor nerve, mainly the levator palpebrae portion. We did not find a reasonable explanation for squint. Finally, ataxia is caused by compression of the superior cerebellar peduncle.</p>

                Background: Spirulina platensis contains several bioactive molecules such as phenol, flavonoid and phycocyanin pigments. This study unveils total phenol, flavonoid, antioxidant activity, phycocyanin content and evaluated encapsulation efficiency from Ocimum basilicum intervention on S. platensis. O. basilicum intervention aims to reduce unpleasant odors from S. platensis that will increase consumption and increase bioactive compounds.   Methods: The intervention was carried out by soaking a S. platensis control sample (SP) in O. basilicum with a ratio of 1:4 (w/v) and it was then dried (DSB) and microencapsulated by freeze drying methods (MSB) using a combination of maltodextrin and gelatin. Total flavonoid and phenolic analysis with curve fitting analysis used a linear regression approach. Antioxidant activity of samples was analysed with the 2,2’-azino-bis-3-3thylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) method. Data were analysed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Tukey test models using SPSS v.22.  Results: The result of this study indicated that O. basilicum intervention treatment (DSB) has the potential to increase bioactive compounds such as total phenol, antioxidant activity and phycocyanin, and flavonoid content. Intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis (DSB) significantly increases total phenol by 49.5% and phycocyanin by 40.7%. This is due to the phenol and azulene compounds in O. basilicum which have a synergistic effect on phenol and phycocyanin in S. platensis. Microencapsulation using a maltodexrin and gelatin coating is effective in phycocyanin protection and antioxidant activity with an encapsulation efficiency value of 71.58% and 80.5%.   Conclusion: The intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis improved the total phenol and phycocyanin content and there is potential for a pharmaceutical product for a functional food and pharmaceutical product.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Unsupervised Methods for Detection of Neural States: Case Study of Hippocampal-Amygdala Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The hippocampus and amygdala are functionally coupled brain regions that play a crucial role in processes involving memory and learning. Because interareal communication has been reported both during specific sleep stages and in awake, behaving animals, these brain regions can serve as an archetype to establish that measuring functional interactions is important for comprehending neural systems. To this end, we analyze here a public dataset of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in rats simultaneously from the hippocampus and amygdala during different behaviors. Employing a specific, time-lagged embedding technique, named topological causality (TC), we infer directed interactions between the LFP band powers of the two regions across six frequency bands in a time-resolved manner. The combined power and interaction signals are processed with our own unsupervised tools developed originally for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations to effectively visualize and identify putative, neural states that are visited by the animals repeatedly. Our proposed methodology minimizes impositions onto the data, such as isolating specific epochs, or averaging across externally annotated behavioral stages, and succeeds in separating internal states by external labels such as sleep or stimulus events. We show that this works better for two of the three rats we analyzed, and highlight the need to acknowledge individuality in analyses of this type. Importantly, we demonstrate that the quantification of functional interactions is a significant factor in discriminating these external labels, and we suggest our methodology as a general tool for large, multisite recordings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Imaging human engrams using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The investigation of the physical traces of memories (engrams) has made significant progress in the last decade due to optogenetics and fluorescent cell tagging applied in rodents. Engram cells were identified. The ablation of engram cells led to the loss of the associated memory, silent memories were reactivated, and artificial memories were implanted in the brain. Human engram research lags behind engram research in rodents due to methodological and ethical constraints. However, advances in multivariate analysis techniques of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and machine learning algorithms allowed the identification of stable engram patterns in humans. In addition, MRI scanners with an ultrahigh field strength of 7 Tesla (T) have left their prototype state and became more common around the world to assist human engram research. Although most engram research in humans is still being performed with a field strength of 3T, fMRI at 7T will push engram research. Here, we summarize the current state and findings of human engram research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying 7 versus 3T fMRI to image human memory traces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between media use and poor sleep quality among senior high school students: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Poor sleep quality (PSQ) is an increasing health problem among adolescents. Mobile phones and portable media devices have become a part of children’s lives and may affect their sleep duration and quality. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of PSQ and identify the association between media use and PSQ among adolescents studying in high school grades 10-12. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in central Thailand. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to enroll 777 adolescents from eight schools from August to October 2016. The research instruments comprised factors of demographics and consumption behaviors and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Prevalence of PSQ was 56.24%. The study subjects were mostly 16-17 years old (67.82%) and female (70.39%). Multivariable logistic regression, after controlling for possible confounders, revealed an increased odds of PSQ among those who used a social media device (OR=1.34, 95%CI=0.97-1.87), and showed a higher proportion of social media use in the PSQ group. Conclusion: A surveillance system to detect media use and PSQ should be conducted accompanied by knowledge sharing on media use among parents, teachers and adolescents. To determine causal relationships, further longitudinal studies will be required to test the association between media users and PSQ. This study may also provide some implications for health promotion on sleep quality of senior high school students.

                How does the metabolically expensive mammalian brain adapt to food scarcity? Padamsey et al. show that under food restriction, mouse visual cortical neurons save ATP by decreasing excitatory currents. Compensatory mechanisms preserve spike rate but decrease coding precision of visual information. Supplementation with the fat mass-regulated hormone leptin restores coding precision.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Behavioral control by depolarized and hyperpolarized states of an integrating neuron</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated transitions between mutually exclusive motor states are central to behavioral decisions. During locomotion, the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> spontaneously cycles between forward runs, reversals, and turns with complex but predictable dynamics. Here, we provide insight into these dynamics by demonstrating how RIM interneurons, which are active during reversals, act in two modes to stabilize both forward runs and reversals. By systematically quantifying the roles of RIM outputs during spontaneous behavior, we show that RIM lengthens reversals when depolarized through glutamate and tyramine neurotransmitters and lengthens forward runs when hyperpolarized through its gap junctions. RIM is not merely silent upon hyperpolarization: RIM gap junctions actively reinforce a hyperpolarized state of the reversal circuit. Additionally, the combined outputs of chemical synapses and gap junctions from RIM regulate forward-to-reversal transitions. Our results indicate that multiple classes of RIM synapses create behavioral inertia during spontaneous locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The hepatic AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis regulates glucose homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) is involved in multiple biological functions in cell development, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. <i>Tet1</i> deficient mice display the defects of murine glucose metabolism. However, the role of TET1 in metabolic homeostasis keeps unknown. Here, our finding demonstrates that hepatic TET1 physically interacts with SIRT1 <i>via</i> its C-terminal and activates its deacetylase activity, further regulating the acetylation-dependent cellular trans-localization of transcriptional factors PGC-1a and FOXO1, resulting in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression that includes <i>PPARGC1A</i>, <i>G6PC</i>, and <i>SLC2A4</i>. Importantly, the hepatic gluconeogenic gene activation program induced by fasting is inhibited in <i>Tet1</i> heterozygous mice livers. The AMPK activators metformin or AICAR-two compounds that mimic fasting-elevate hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression dependent on in turn activation of the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis. Collectively, our study identifies TET1 as a SIRT1 coactivator and demonstrates that the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis represents a potential mechanism or therapeutic target for glucose metabolism or metabolic diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aversive stimuli bias corticothalamic responses to motivationally significant cues</a></h4>

              
                Making predictions about future rewards or punishments is fundamental to adaptive behavior. These processes are influenced by prior experience. For example, prior exposure to aversive stimuli or stressors changes behavioral responses to negative- and positive-value predictive cues. Here, we demonstrate a role for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT; mPFC→PVT) in this process. We found that a history of aversive stimuli negatively biased behavioral responses to motivationally relevant cues in mice and that this negative bias was associated with hyperactivity in mPFC→PVT neurons during exposure to those cues. Furthermore, artificially mimicking this hyperactive response with selective optogenetic excitation of the same pathway recapitulated the negative behavioral bias induced by aversive stimuli, whereas optogenetic inactivation of mPFC→PVT neurons prevented the development of the negative bias. Together, our results highlight how information flow within the mPFC→PVT circuit is critical for making predictions about motivationally-relevant outcomes as a function of prior experience.

                Despite several advances in the field, pharmacodynamic outcome measures reflective of LRRK2 kinase activity in clinical biofluids remain urgently needed. A variety of targets and approaches have been utilized including assessments of LRRK2 itself (levels, phosphorylation), or its substrates (e.g. Rab10 or other Rab GTPases). We have previously shown that intrinsic kinase activity of LRRK2 isolated from PBMCs of G2019S carriers is elevated, irrespective of disease status. In the present study we find that phosphorylation of Rab10 is also elevated in G2019S carriers, but only those with PD. Additionally, phosphorylation of this substrate is also elevated in 2 separate idiopathic PD cohorts, but not in carriers of the A53T mutation in -synuclein. In contrast, Rab29 phosphorylation was specifically reduced in urinary exosomes from A53T and idiopathic PD patients. Taken together, our findings highlight the need for the assessment of multiple complimentary targets for a more comprehensive picture of the disease.

                The optic tectum (OT) is a multilaminated midbrain structure that acts as the primary retinorecipient in the zebrafish brain. Homologous to the mammalian superior colliculus, the OT is responsible for the reception and integration of stimuli, followed by elicitation of salient behavioral responses. While the OT has been the focus of functional experiments for decades, less is known concerning specific cell types, microcircuitry, and their individual functions within the OT. Recent efforts have contributed substantially to the knowledge of tectal cell types; however, a comprehensive cell catalog is incomplete. Here we contribute to this growing effort by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomic profiles of tectal cells labeled by the transgenic enhancer trap line y304Et(cfos:Gal4;UAS:Kaede). We sequenced 13,320 cells, a 4X cellular coverage, and identified 25 putative OT cell populations. Within those cells, we identified several mature and developing neuronal populations, as well as non-neuronal cell types including oligodendrocytes, microglia, and radial glia. Although most mature neurons demonstrate GABAergic activity, several glutamatergic populations are present, as well as one glycinergic population. We also conducted Gene Ontology analysis to identify enriched biological processes, and computed RNA velocity to infer current and future transcriptional cell states. Finally, we conducted in situ hybridization to validate our bioinformatic analyses and spatially map select clusters. In conclusion, the larval zebrafish OT is a complex structure containing at least 25 transcriptionally distinct cell populations. To our knowledge, this is the first time scRNA-seq has been applied to explore the OT alone and in depth.

We found an incomplete recovery of the olfactory sensory neurons, prolonged activation of glial cells in the olfactory bulb, and a decrease in the density of dendritic spines within the hippocampus.

                Astrocytes have complex roles in central nervous system (CNS) health and disease. Underlying these roles is an elaborate architecture based on frequent, extremely fine, but seemingly haphazard branches, as well as prominent features including tripartite synaptic complexes and perivascular endfeet. While broad categories of structures in astrocytes are known, the fundamental building blocks that compose them and their organizing principles have yet to be adequately defined. This is largely due to the absence of high-resolution datasets that can reveal nanoscopic features of astrocytes (i.e. 10-20nm diameter in x, y, and z) and a lack of computational approaches that can effectively interrogate astrocyte shape, organization, and nanoarchitecture. Here, we produced and analyzed multiple, high-resolution datasets of layer 2/3 mouse somatosensory cortex using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (8nm intervals) and computer vision approaches to provide a principled, quantitative analysis of astrocytic nanoarchitecture. A decomposition of astrocytes into fundamental "parts" led to the discovery of unique structural components, recurring structural motifs, and assembly of parts into an organized hierarchy. New relationships were also discerned between astrocytic processes and other CNS microanatomy including mitochondria, tripartite synapses, and cerebrovasculature. By deploying computational resources to quantitatively understand the organizing principles and nanoarchitecture of astrocytes, this study reveals the specialized anatomical adaptations of these complex cells within the CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An astrocytic signaling loop for frequency-dependent control of dendritic integration and spatial learning</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells amplify clustered glutamatergic input by activation of voltage-gated sodium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). NMDAR activity depends on the presence of NMDAR co-agonists such as D-serine, but how co-agonists influence dendritic integration is not well understood. Using combinations of whole-cell patch clamp, iontophoretic glutamate application, two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and glutamate uncaging we found that exogenous D-serine reduces the threshold of dendritic spikes and increases their amplitude. Triggering an astrocytic mechanism controlling endogenous D-serine supply via endocannabinoid receptors (CBRs) also increased dendritic spiking. Unexpectedly, this pathway was activated by pyramidal cell activity primarily in the theta range, which required HCN channels and astrocytic CB1Rs. Therefore, astrocytes close a positive and frequency-dependent feedback loop between pyramidal cell activity and their integration of dendritic input. Its disruption led to an impairment of spatial memory, which demonstrates its behavioral relevance.

                The striatum is one of the key nuclei for adequate control of voluntary behaviors and reinforcement learning. Two striatal projection neuron types, expressing either dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) or dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) constitute two independent output routes: the direct or indirect pathways, respectively. These pathways co-work in balance to achieve coordinated behavior. Two projection neuron types are equivalently intermingled in most striatal space. However, recent studies revealed two atypical zones in the caudal striatum: the zone in which D1R-neurons are the minor population (D1R-poor zone) and that in which D2R-neurons are the minority (D2R-poor zone). It remains obscure as to whether these imbalanced zones have similar properties on axonal projections and electrophysiology to other striatal regions. Based on morphological experiments in mice using immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and neural tracing, here, we revealed the poor zones densely projected to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars lateralis, with a few collaterals in substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta. As other striatal regions, D1R-neurons were the direct pathway neurons, while projection neurons in the poor zones possessed similar electrophysiological membrane properties to those in the conventional striatum using in vitro electrophysiological recording. In addition, the poor zones existed irrespective of the age of mice. We also identified the poor zones in the common marmoset as well as other rodents. These results suggest that the poor zones in the caudal striatum follow the conventional projection patterns irrespective of imbalanced distribution of projection neurons. The poor zones could be an innate structure and common in mammals and relate to specific functions via highly restricted projections.

                Mutations altering the scaffolding protein Shank are linked to several psychiatric disorders, and to synaptic and behavioral defects in mice. Among its many binding partners, Shank directly binds CaV1 voltage activated calcium channels. Here we show that the C. elegans SHN-1/Shank promotes CaV1 coupling to calcium activated potassium channels. Mutations inactivating SHN-1, and those preventing SHN-1 binding to EGL-19/CaV1 all increase action potential durations in body muscles. Action potential repolarization is mediated by two classes of potassium channels: SHK-1/KCNA and SLO-1 and SLO-2 BK channels. BK channels are calcium-dependent, and their activation requires tight coupling to EGL-19/CaV1 channels. SHN-1s effects on AP duration are mediated by changes in BK channels. In shn-1 mutants, SLO-2 currents and channel clustering are significantly decreased in both body muscles and neurons. Finally, increased and decreased shn-1 gene copy number produce similar changes in AP width and SLO-2 current. Collectively, these results suggest that an important function of Shank is to promote nanodomain coupling of BK with CaV1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CDK5 mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 regulates its activity and neuroinflammation in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) by p25, contributes to neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in Parkinsons Disease (PD) and Alzheimer diseases (AD). However, the mechanism by which CDK5 induces neuroinflammation in the PD brain is largely unexplored. Here, we show that CDK5 phosphorylates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) at Thr-268 and Ser-505 sites lead to its activation and generation of eicosanoid products. Mutational studies using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular simulations show that the architecture of the protein changes upon each single-point mutation. Interestingly, double-mutations also led to severe decline in the activity of cPLA2 and disruption of its translocation to the plasma membrane. Further, the brain lysates of transgenic PD mouse models show hyperactivation of CDK5 resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Thr-268 and Ser-505 of cPLA2 and its heightened activity confirming the findings observed in the cell culture model of PD. These phosphorylation sites of cPLA2 and CDK5 could be explored as the future therapeutic targets against neuroinflammation in PD. Further, conjoint transcriptomic analysis of the publicly available human PD datasets strengthens the hypothesis that genes of the arachidonic acid, prostaglandin synthesis and inflammatory pathways are significantly upregulated in the case of the PD patients as compared to that of healthy controls.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal ghrelin signalling informs the decision to eat</a></h4>

              
                Hunger is an internal state that not only invigorates behaviour towards feeding, but also acts as a contextual cue for the higher-order control of anticipatory feeding-related behaviour. The ventral hippocampus is a brain region important in encoding context, but how internal contexts such as hunger are represented in hippocampal circuits is not known. Pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus, and in particular within the ventral CA1/subiculum border (vS) express the receptor for the peripheral hunger hormone ghrelin, and ghrelin is known to cross the blood brain barrier and directly influence hippocampal circuitry. However, what role vS neurons play during feeding related behaviour, and how ghrelin influences this role has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology, optogenetics and molecular knockdown together with in vivo calcium imaging in mice to investigate the role of vS during feeding behaviour across different states of hunger. We found that activity of a unique subpopulation of vS neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (vS-NAc) were active specifically when animals approached and investigated food, and that that this activity inhibited the transition to begin eating. Increases in peripheral ghrelin reduced vS-NAc activity during this anticipatory phase of feeding behaviour, by increasing the influence of synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, this effect required postsynaptic GHSR1a expression in vS-NAc neurons, suggesting a direct role of ghrelin signalling. Consistent with this role of hippocampal ghrelin signalling, removal of GHSR1a from vS-NAc neurons impaired ghrelin-induced changes in feeding-related behaviour. Together, these experiments define a ghrelin-sensitive hippocampal circuit that informs the decision to eat based on internal state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural reinstatement tracks object-based attentional selection in working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold information in mind in the short-term and use it flexibly for behaviour. Not all items are represented equally in WM. Attention can be allocated to select and privilege relevant WM content. It is unclear whether attention selects individual features or whole objects in WM. Here, we used behavioural measures, eye-tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) to test the hypothesis that attentional selection spreads between an object's features in WM. Twenty-six participants (male and female) completed a WM task that asked them to recall the angle of one of two oriented, coloured bars after a delay while EEG and eye-tracking data was collected. During the delay, an orthogonal 'incidental task' cued the colour of one item for a match/mismatch judgement. On congruent trials (50%), the cued item was probed during memory recall; on incongruent trials (50%), the other memory item was probed. As predicted, selecting the colour of an object in WM brought other features of the cued object into an attended state as revealed by EEG decoding, oscillatory alpha-power, gaze bias and improved subsequent orientation recall performance. Together, the results build a case for object-based attentional selection in WM. Analyses of neural processing at recall revealed that the selected object was automatically compared with the probe, whether it was the target for recall or not, providing a potential mechanism for non-predictive cueing benefits in WM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticostriatal dynamics underlying components of binge-like eating in mice</a></h4>

              
                Binge eating (BE) is a maladaptive repetitive feeding behavior present across nearly all eating disorder diagnoses. BE is associated with poor psychosocial outcomes (e.g., suicidal ideation) and increased risk for obesity. Despite the substantial negative impact of BE, its underlying neural mechanisms are largely unknown. Many other repetitive behavior disorders (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder) show dysfunction within corticostriatal circuitry. Additionally, previous pre clinical and clinical work has highlighted an imbalance between goal directed and habitual responding in BE. The aim of the current study was to longitudinally examine in vivo neural activity within corticostriatal regions associated with habitual behavior, the infralimbic cortex (IL) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS), using a robust pre clinical model for BE. Female C57BL/6 mice (N = 32) were randomized to receive: 1) intermittent (daily, 2-hour) binge-like access to palatable food (BE mice), or 2) continuous, non-intermittent (24-hour) access to palatable food (non-BE mice). In vivo calcium imaging was performed via fiber photometry at the baseline timepoint and after 4 weeks (chronic timepoint) of engagement in the model for BE. Feeding behaviors (feeding bout onset, offset) during the recordings were captured using contact lickometers which generated TTL outputs for precise alignment of BE behavior to neural data. Results in the IL showed no specific changes in neural activity related to BE. However, BE animals showed decreased DLS activity from the baseline to chronic timepoint at feeding onset and offset. Additionally, BE mice had significantly lower DLS activity at feeding onset and offset during the chronic time point compared to non-BE mice. These results point to a role for DLS hypofunction in chronic BE, highlighting a potential target for future treatment intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">First-order visual interneurons distribute distinct contrast and luminance information across ON and OFF pathways to achieve stable behavior</a></h4>

              
                The accurate processing of contrast is the basis for all visually guided behaviors. Visual scenes with rapidly changing illumination challenge contrast computation, because adaptation is not fast enough to compensate for such changes. Yet, human perception of contrast is stable even when the visual environment is quickly changing. The fruit fly Drosophila also shows nearly luminance invariant behavior for both ON and OFF stimuli. To achieve this, first-order interneurons L1, L2 and L3 all encode contrast and luminance differently, and distribute information across both ON and OFF contrast-selective pathways. Behavioral responses to both ON and OFF stimuli rely on a luminance-based correction provided by L1 and L3, wherein L1 supports contrast computation linearly, and L3 non-linearly amplifies dim stimuli. Therefore, L1, L2 and L3 are not distinct inputs to ON and OFF pathways but the lamina serves as a separate processing layer that distributes distinct luminance and contrast information across ON and OFF pathways to support behavioral performance in varying conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential relationships between brain structure and dual task walking in young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Almost 25% of all older adults experience difficulty walking. Mobility difficulties for older adults are more pronounced when performing a simultaneous cognitive task while walking (i.e., dual task walking). Although it is known that aging results in widespread brain atrophy, few studies have integrated across more than one neuroimaging modality to comprehensively examine the structural neural correlates that may underly dual task walking in older age. We collected spatiotemporal gait data during single and dual task walking for 37 young (18-34 years) and 23 older adults (66-86 years). We also collected T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI scans to determine how brain structure differs in older age and relates to dual task walking. We addressed two aims: 1) to characterize age differences in brain structure across a range of metrics including volumetric, surface, and white matter microstructure; and 2) to test for age group differences in the relationship between brain structure and the dual task cost (DTcost) of gait speed and variability. Key findings included widespread brain atrophy for the older adults, with the most pronounced age differences in brain regions related to sensorimotor processing. We also found multiple associations between regional brain atrophy and greater DTcost of gait speed and variability for the older adults. The older adults showed a relationship of both thinner temporal cortex and shallower sulcal depth in the frontal, sensorimotor, and parietal cortices with greater DTcost of gait. Additionally, the older adults showed a relationship of ventricular volume and superior longitudinal fasciculus free-water corrected axial and radial diffusivity with greater DTcost of gait. These relationships were not present for the young adults. Stepwise multiple regression found sulcal depth in the left precentral gyrus, axial diffusivity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and sex to best predict DTcost of gait speed, and cortical thickness in the superior temporal gyrus to best predict DTcost of gait variability for older adults. These results contribute to scientific understanding of how individual variations in brain structure are associated with mobility function in aging. This has implications for uncovering mechanisms of brain aging and for identifying target regions for mobility interventions for aging populations.

                Background: Tissue damage and cellular destruction are the major events in traumatic brain injury (TBI), which trigger sterile neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses in the brain. While appropriate acute and transient neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses facilitate the repair and adaptation of injured brain tissues, prolonged and excessive neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses exacerbate brain damage. The mechanisms that control the intensity and duration of neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses in TBI largely remain elusive. Methods: We used the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI to study the role of immune checkpoints (ICPs), key regulators of immune homeostasis, in the regulation of neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses in the brain in vivo. Results: We found that de novo expression of PD-L1, a potent inhibitory ICP, was robustly and transiently induced in reactive astrocytes, but not in microglial cells, neurons, or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). These PD-L1+ reactive astrocytes were highly enriched to form a dense zone around the TBI lesion. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling enlarged brain tissue cavity size, increased infiltration of inflammatory Ly-6CHigh monocytes/macrophages (M/M{phi}) but not tissue-repairing Ly-6CLow/F4/80+ M/M{phi}, and worsened TBI outcomes in mice. PD-L1 gene knockout enhanced production of CCL2 that interacted with its cognate receptor CCR2 on Ly-6CHigh M/M{phi} to chemotactically recruit these cells into inflammatory sites. Mechanically, PD-L1 signaling in astrocytes likely exhibits dual inhibitory activities for the prevention of excessive neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses to TBI through (1) the PD-1/PD-L1 axis to suppress the activity of brain-infiltrating PD-1+ immune cells such as PD-1+ T cells, and (2) PD-L1 reverse signaling to regulate the timing and intensity of astrocyte reactions to TBI. Conclusions: PD-L1+ astrocytes act as a gatekeeper to the brain to control TBI-related neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory responses, thereby opening a novel avenue to study the role of ICP-neuroimmune axes in the pathophysiology of TBI and other neurological disorders.

	<p>Theatre-based practices, such as improvisation, are frequently applied to simulate everyday social interactions. Although the improvisational context is acknowledged as fictional, realistic emotions may emerge, a phenomenon labelled the ‘paradox of fiction’. This study investigated how manipulating the context (real-life versus fictional) modulates psychophysiological reactivity to social rejection during dyadic interactions. We measured psychophysiological responses elicited during real-life (interview) and fictional (improvisation exercises) social rejections. We analysed the heart rate (HR), skin conductance, facial muscle activity, and electrocortical activity (electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha asymmetry) of student teachers (N = 39) during various social rejections (devaluing, interrupting, nonverbal rejection). All social rejections evoked negative EEG alpha asymmetry, a measure reflecting behavioural withdrawal motivation. Psychophysiological responses during real-life and fictional rejections correlated, and rejection type modified the responses. When comparing responses across all rejection types, facial muscle activity and EEG alpha asymmetry did not differ between real-life and fictional rejections, whereas HR decelerated and skin conductance increased during fictional rejections. These findings demonstrate that regardless of cognitive awareness of fictionality, relatively subtle social rejections elicited psychophysiological reactivity indicating emotional arousal and negative valence. These findings provide novel, biological evidence for the application of theatre-based improvisation to studying experientially everyday social encounters.</p>

	<p>Functional disability due to spatial neglect hinders recovery in up to 30% of stroke survivors. Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) may alleviate the disabling consequences of spatial neglect, but we do not yet know why some individuals show much better outcomes following PAT than others. The goal of this scoping review and meta-analysis was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying prism adaptation (PA). We conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses across fMRI studies investigating brain activity before, during, and after PA, in healthy individuals and patients with right or left brain damage (RBD or LBD) due to stroke. In healthy adults, PA was linked with activity in posterior parietal and cerebellar clusters, reduced bilateral parieto-frontal connectivity, and increased fronto-limbic and sensorimotor network connectivity. In contrast, RBD individuals with spatial neglect relied on different circuits, including an activity cluster in the intact left occipital cortex. This finding is consistent with a shift in hemispheric dominance in spatial processing to the left hemisphere. However, more studies are needed to clarify the contribution of lesion location and load on the circuits involved in PA after unilateral brain damage. Future studies are also needed to clarify the relationship of decreasing resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) to visuomotor function.</p>

	<p>To investigate the relationship between short-range and homotopic long-range resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children, we analyzed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) RSFC in 25 children with ASD and 22 age-matched TD children. The resting state fNIRS signals, including spontaneous fluctuations in the oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, were recorded from the bilateral temporal lobes. We found that (1) there was no difference in the short-range RSFC between the left and right hemisphere in either ASD or TD group; (2) both the short-range and homotopic long-range RSFC were weaker in the ASD than TD group; and (3) the short-range RSFC was stronger than the homotopic long-range RSFC in the ASD group, whereas no such difference was observed in the TD group. These observations might be helpful for a better understanding of the underlying cortical mechanism in ASD.</p>

	<p>Lacunar stroke (LS) is responsible for one-quarter of the overall number of ischemic strokes with long-term complications and carries health and economic issues for patients and health care systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate lacunar versus non-lacunar strokes in a tertiary academic center. From February 2016 to July 2019, all patients admitted to the stroke unit were retrospectively reviewed. We included LS patients and compared them to other TOAST subtypes. Hemorrhagic stroke and conditions mimicking stroke were excluded. Regression analysis was done to determine LS predictors and outcomes. A 35.5% rate of LS among 989 ischemic stroke patients was found. Most patients (71.9%) were males. Lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at admission and negative history for cardiac diseases were predictors for LS in our population. At discharge, LS patients had low NIHSS scores and shorter hospitalization periods compared to non-LS patients. In conclusion, LS was prevalent among ischemic stroke patients in our cohort. Future studies are highly needed with long follow-up intervals to identify the stroke recurrence, complications, and outcomes.</p>

	<p>Epileptogenesis may be responsible for both of recurrent seizures and comorbid depression in epilepsy. Disease-modifying treatments targeting the latent period before spontaneous recurrent seizures may contribute to the remission of seizures and comorbid depression. We hypothesized that pre-treatment with 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor, which has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects might rescue status epilepticus (SE)-induced dendritic spine loss and alleviate depressive behaviours. Rats were either pre-treated with TPPU (0.1 mg/kg/d) intragastrically or with vehicle (40% polyethylene glycol 400) from 7 days before to 7 days after SE that was induced with lithium chloride and pilocarpine intraperitoneally. Rats in the Control group were given saline instead. The forced swim test (FST) was performed on the 8th day after SE to evaluate the depression-like behaviours in rats. The results showed that seizures severity during SE was significantly decreased, and the immobility time during FST was significantly increased through TPPU pre-treatment. Moreover, pre-treatment with TPPU attenuated inflammations including microglial gliosis and the level of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the hippocampus; in addition, neuronal and dendritic spine loss in the subfields of hippocampus was selectively rescued, and the expression of NR1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, ERK1/2, CREB, and their phosphorylated forms involved in the dendritic spine development were all significantly increased. We concluded that pre-treatment with TPPU attenuated seizures severity during SE and depressive behaviours during the period of epileptogenesis probably by rescuing dendritic spine loss in the hippocampus.</p>

	<p>In this case, 62 university students participated in the study, in which a between-subjects design was adopted. Participants were also given the behavioral approach system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) scales. Participants had to read a list of 60 sentences with interpersonal and neutral content: 20 approach (“Pedro accepted Rosa in Whatsapp”), 20 avoidance (“Pedro Blocked Rosa in Whatsapp”) and 20 neutral (“Marta thought about the causes of the problem”). After reading them, they were subjected to 20 min of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in one of the two conditions: anodal (31) or sham (31). After tDCS, they had to read other list of 60 sentences matched in approach, avoidance and neutral contents with the former list. We found significant improvement in reading speed after anodal stimulation for social and neutral sentences. Regarding affective traits, we found that anodal stimulation benefitted reading speed in low-BIS and low-BAS participants and had no effect in either high BAS or high BIS participants. In addition, tDCS improvement in reading speed was significantly lower in avoidance sentences in low-BIS (avoidance) participants. We discuss these results at the light of previous research and highlight the importance of approach and avoidance traits as moderators of tDCS effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Level of hM4D(Gi) DREADD Expression Determines Inhibitory and Neurotoxic Effects in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Selective neuromodulation using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) has become an increasingly important research tool, as well as an emerging therapeutic approach. However, the safety profile of DREADD expression is unknown. Here, different titers of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector were administered in an attempt to vary total expression levels of the inhibitory DREADD hM4D(Gi) in excitatory hippocampal neurons. Male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with AAV2/7 encoding DREADD-mCherry, DREADD, or mCherry. Pronounced neuronal loss and neuroinflammatory reactions were observed after transduction with the high titer DREADD AAV, which also resulted in the highest DREADD expression levels. No such effects were observed in the mCherry control group, despite an equally high titer, nor in conditions where lower viral vector titers were injected. In the high titer DREADD conditions, dentate gyrus (DG) evoked potentials were inhibited on clozapine-induced activation of hM4D(Gi), while in low titer conditions DG evoked potentials were enhanced. Recordings of single neuronal activity nevertheless indicated a reduction in spontaneous firing of granule cell layer neurons. Our results indicate that prolonged, high levels of DREADD expression can have neurotoxic effects and that chemogenetic suppression of excitatory hippocampal neurons can paradoxically enhance DG evoked potentials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Narrow and Broad {gamma} Bands Process Complementary Visual Information in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p> Band plays a key role in the encoding of visual features in the primary visual cortex (V1). In rodents V1 two ranges within the  band are sensitive to contrast: a broad  band (BB) increasing with contrast, and a narrow  band (NB), peaking at ~60 Hz, decreasing with contrast. The functional roles of the two bands and the neural circuits originating them are not completely clear yet. Here, we show, combining experimental and simulated data, that in mice V1 (1) BB carries information about high contrast and NB about low contrast; (2) BB modulation depends on excitatory-inhibitory interplay in the cortex, while NB modulation is because of entrainment to the thalamic drive. In awake mice presented with alternating gratings, NB power progressively decreased from low to intermediate levels of contrast where it reached a plateau. Conversely, BB power was constant across low levels of contrast, but it progressively increased from intermediate to high levels of contrast. Furthermore, BB response was stronger immediately after contrast reversal, while the opposite held for NB. These complementary modulations were reproduced by a recurrent excitatory-inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire network provided that the thalamic inputs were composed of a sustained and a periodic component having complementary sensitivity ranges. These results show that in rodents the thalamic-driven NB plays a specific key role in encoding visual contrast. Moreover, we propose a simple and effective network model of response to visual stimuli in rodents that might help in investigating network dysfunctions of pathologic visual information processing.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Whole slide scanning technology has enabled the generation of high-resolution images from complete tissue sections. However, commonly used analysis software is often unable to handle the large data files produced. Here, we present a method using the open-source software QuPath to detect, classify and quantify fluorescently-labeled cells (microglia and pericytes) in whole coronal brain tissue sections. Whole-brain sections from both male and female NG2DsRed x CX<SUB>3</SUB>CR1<sup>+/GFP</sup> mice were analyzed. Small regions of interest were selected and manual counts were compared with counts generated from an automated approach, across a range of detection parameters. The optimal parameters for detecting cells and classifying them as microglia or pericytes in each brain region were determined and applied to annotations corresponding to the entire somatosensory and motor cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus in each section. 3.74% of all detected cells were classified as pericytes; however, this proportion was significantly higher in the thalamus (6.20%) than in other regions. In contrast, microglia (4.51% of total cells) were more abundant in the cortex (5.54%). No differences were detected between male and female mice. In conclusion, QuPath offers a user-friendly solution to whole-slide image analysis which could lead to important new discoveries in both health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Characterization of the Brain Functional Architecture of Psychostimulant Withdrawal Using Single-Cell Whole-Brain Imaging</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Numerous brain regions have been identified as contributing to withdrawal behaviors, but it is unclear the way in which these brain regions as a whole lead to withdrawal. The search for a final common brain pathway that is involved in withdrawal remains elusive. To address this question, we implanted osmotic minipumps containing either saline, nicotine (24 mg/kg/d), cocaine (60 mg/kg/d), or methamphetamine (4 mg/kg/d) for one week in male C57BL/6J mice. After one week, the minipumps were removed and brains collected 8 h (saline, nicotine, and cocaine) or 12 h (methamphetamine) after removal. We then performed single-cell whole-brain imaging of neural activity during the withdrawal period when brains were collected. We used hierarchical clustering and graph theory to identify similarities and differences in brain functional architecture. Although methamphetamine and cocaine shared some network similarities, the main common neuroadaptation between these psychostimulant drugs was a dramatic decrease in modularity, with a shift from a cortical-driven to subcortical-driven network, including a decrease in total hub brain regions. These results demonstrate that psychostimulant withdrawal produces the drug-dependent remodeling of functional architecture of the brain and suggest that the decreased modularity of brain functional networks and not a specific set of brain regions may represent the final common pathway associated with withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Humans Use a Temporally Local Code for Vibrotactile Perception</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Sensory environments are commonly characterized by specific physical features, which sensory systems might exploit using dedicated processing mechanisms. In the tactile sense, one such characteristic feature is frictional movement, which gives rise to short-lasting (&lt;10 ms), information-carrying integument vibrations. Rather than generic integrative encoding (i.e., averaging or spectral analysis capturing the "intensity" and "best frequency"), the tactile system might benefit from, what we call a "temporally local" coding scheme that instantaneously detects and analyzes shapes of these short-lasting features. Here, by employing analytic psychophysical measurements, we tested whether the prerequisite of temporally local coding exists in the human tactile system. We employed pulsatile skin indentations at the fingertip that allowed us to trade manipulation of local pulse shape against changes in global intensity and frequency, achieved by adding pulses of the same shape. We found that manipulation of local pulse shape has strong effects on psychophysical performance, arguing for the notion that humans implement a temporally local coding scheme for perceptual decisions. As we found distinct differences in performance using different kinematic layouts of pulses, we inquired whether temporally local coding is tuned to a unique kinematic variable. This was not the case, since we observed different preferred kinematic variables in different ranges of pulse shapes. Using an established encoding model for primary afferences and indentation stimuli, we were able to demonstrate that the found kinematic preferences in human performance, may well be explained by the response characteristics of Pacinian corpuscles (PCs), a class of human tactile primary afferents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">DBscorer: An Open-Source Software for Automated Accurate Analysis of Rodent Behavior in Forced Swim Test and Tail Suspension Test</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) are commonly used behavioral tests for screening antidepressant drugs with a high predictive validity. These tests have also proved useful to assess the non-motor symptoms in the animal models of movement disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Huntington&rsquo;s disease. Manual analysis of FST and TST is a time-consuming exercise and has large observer-to-observer variability. Automation of behavioral analysis alleviates these concerns, but there are no easy-to-use open-source tools for such analysis. Here, we describe the development of Depression Behavior Scorer (DBscorer), an open-source program installable on Windows, with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), that helps in accurate quantification of immobility behavior in FST and TST from video analysis. Several calibration options allow customization of various parameters to suit the experimental requirements. Apart from the readout of time spent immobile, DBscorer also provides additional data and graphics of immobility/mobility states across time revealing the evolution of behavioral despair over the duration of the test and allows the analysis of additional parameters. Such comprehensive analysis allows a more nuanced understanding of the expression of behavioral despair in FST and TST. We believe that DBscorer would make analysis of behavior in FST and TST unbiased, automated and rapid, and hence prove to be helpful to the wider neuroscience community.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Acute abdomen presentation revealing a metastatic invasive mole with uterine rupture [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia refers to the aggressive subset of gestational trophoblastic disease, including invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. These tumors may have atypical clinical presentations that can mislead the diagnosis. The reported case is a 48-year-old woman in perimenopause, without any history of vaginal bleedings nor molar pregnancy, who presented to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain. Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) was highly elevated at 261 675.23 mIU/ml. A complicated invasive mole was suspected, and an abdominal computed tomography was performed, showing a moderate hemoperitoneum associated to complex cystic and solid uterine mass, with a common left iliac adenomegaly and multiple pulmonary nodules. MRI showed a multiloculated cystic uterine mass with zones of hemorrhage recalling an invasive mole with perforation of the posterior uterus wall, associated to a high abundance hemoperitoneum. The diagnosis of a metastatic invasive mole complicated of uterine rupture and hemoperitoneum was retained. A surgical intervention was decided immediately and a subtotal hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy was done. Pathologic examination of the specimen was positive for an invasive mole. The patient was proposed for chemotherapy. This case study will increase awareness of unusual clinical presentations of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia We believe that our case will contribute to the literature not only because of the rarity of this entity in perimenopausal period, but also due the atypical clinical presentation as acute abdomen without vaginal bleeding nor history of molar pregnancy evacuation

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Physics-based modeling provides predictive understanding of selectively promiscuous substrate binding by Hsp70 chaperones</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik B. Nordquist, Charles A. English, Eugenia M. Clerico, Woody Sherman, Lila M. Gierasch, Jianhan Chen</p>

To help cells cope with protein misfolding and aggregation, Hsp70 molecular chaperones selectively bind a variety of sequences (“selective promiscuity”). Statistical analyses from substrate-derived peptide arrays reveal that DnaK, the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> Hsp70, binds to sequences containing three to five branched hydrophobic residues, although otherwise the specific amino acids can vary considerably. Several high-resolution structures of the substrate -binding domain (SBD) of DnaK bound to peptides reveal a highly conserved configuration of the bound substrate and further suggest that the substrate-binding cleft consists of five largely independent sites for interaction with five consecutive substrate residues. Importantly, both substrate backbone orientations (N- to C- and C- to N-) allow essentially the same backbone hydrogen-bonding and side-chain interactions with the chaperone. In order to rationalize these observations, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to sample the interactions of all 20 amino acid side chains in each of the five sites of the chaperone in the context of the conserved substrate backbone configurations. The resulting interaction energetics provide the basis set for deriving a predictive model that we call Paladin (Physics-based model of DnaK-Substrate Binding). Trained using available peptide array data, Paladin can distinguish binders and nonbinders of DnaK with accuracy comparable to existing predictors and further predicts the detailed configuration of the bound sequence. Tested using existing DnaK-peptide structures, Paladin correctly predicted the binding register in 10 out of 13 substrate sequences that bind in the N- to C- orientation, and the binding orientation in 16 out of 22 sequences. The physical basis of the Paladin model provides insight into the origins of how Hsp70s bind substrates with a balance of selectivity and promiscuity. The approach described here can be extended to other Hsp70s where extensive peptide array data is not available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neuroblastoma signalling models unveil combination therapies targeting feedback-mediated resistance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mathurin Dorel, Bertram Klinger, Tommaso Mari, Joern Toedling, Eric Blanc, Clemens Messerschmidt, Michal Nadler-Holly, Matthias Ziehm, Anja Sieber, Falk Hertwig, Dieter Beule, Angelika Eggert, Johannes H. Schulte, Matthias Selbach, Nils Blüthgen</p>

Very high risk neuroblastoma is characterised by increased MAPK signalling, and targeting MAPK signalling is a promising therapeutic strategy. We used a deeply characterised panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and found that the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors varied drastically between these cell lines. By generating quantitative perturbation data and mathematical modelling, we determined potential resistance mechanisms. We found that negative feedbacks within MAPK signalling and via the IGF receptor mediate re-activation of MAPK signalling upon treatment in resistant cell lines. By using cell-line specific models, we predict that combinations of MEK inhibitors with RAF or IGFR inhibitors can overcome resistance, and tested these predictions experimentally. In addition, phospho-proteomic profiling confirmed the cell-specific feedback effects and synergy of MEK and IGFR targeted treatment. Our study shows that a quantitative understanding of signalling and feedback mechanisms facilitated by models can help to develop and optimise therapeutic strategies. Our findings should be considered for the planning of future clinical trials introducing MEKi in the treatment of neuroblastoma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling response strategies for controlling gonorrhoea outbreaks in men who have sex with men in Australia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qibin Duan, Chris Carmody, Basil Donovan, Rebecca J. Guy, Ben B. Hui, John M. Kaldor, Monica M. Lahra, Matthew G. Law, David A. Lewis, Michael Maley, Skye McGregor, Anna McNulty, Christine Selvey, David J. Templeton, David M. Whiley, David G. Regan, James G. Wood</p>

The ability to treat gonorrhoea with current first-line drugs is threatened by the global spread of extensively drug resistant (XDR) <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (NG) strains. In Australia, urban transmission is high among men who have sex with men (MSM) and importation of an XDR NG strain in this population could result in an epidemic that would be difficult and costly to control. An individual-based, anatomical site-specific mathematical model of NG transmission among Australian MSM was developed and used to evaluate the potential for elimination of an imported NG strain under a range of case-based and population-based test-and-treat strategies. When initiated upon detection of the imported strain, these strategies enhance the probability of elimination and reduce the outbreak size compared with current practice (current testing levels and no contact tracing). The most effective strategies combine testing targeted at regular and casual partners with increased rates of population testing. However, even with the most effective strategies, outbreaks can persist for up to 2 years post-detection. Our simulations suggest that local elimination of imported NG strains can be achieved with high probability using combined case-based and population-based test-and-treat strategies. These strategies may be an effective means of preserving current treatments in the event of wider XDR NG emergence.

Herpesviruses cause severe diseases particularly in immunocompromised patients. Both genome packaging and release from the capsid require a unique portal channel occupying one of the 12 capsid vertices. Here, we report the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the pentameric pORF19 of the γ-herpesvirus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) resembling the portal cap that seals this portal channel. We also present the structure of its β-herpesviral ortholog, revealing a striking structural similarity to its α- and γ-herpesviral counterparts despite apparent differences in capsid association. We demonstrate pORF19 pentamer formation in solution and provide insights into how pentamerization is triggered in infected cells. Mutagenesis in its lateral interfaces blocked pORF19 pentamerization and severely affected KSHV capsid assembly and production of infectious progeny. Our results pave the way to better understand the role of pORF19 in capsid assembly and identify a potential novel drug target for the treatment of herpesvirus-induced diseases.

The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic causing significant damage to public health and the economy. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by the lack of robust mouse models. To overcome this barrier, we used a reverse genetic system to generate a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating key mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 variants, this model recapitulates critical elements of human infection including viral replication in the lung, immune cell infiltration, and significant in vivo disease. Importantly, mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 does not impair replication in human airway cells and maintains antigenicity similar to human SARS-CoV-2 strains. Coupled with the incorporation of mutations found in variants of concern, CMA3p20 offers several advantages over other mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains. Using this model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2–infected mice are protected from lethal challenge with the original Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting immunity from heterologous Coronavirus (CoV) strains. Together, the results highlight the use of this mouse model for further study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Fitness costs of female choosiness are low in a socially monogamous songbird</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wolfgang Forstmeier, Daiping Wang, Katrin Martin, Bart Kempenaers</p>

Female mate choice is thought to be responsible for the evolution of many extravagant male ornaments and displays, but the costs of being too selective may hinder the evolution of choosiness. Selection against choosiness may be particularly strong in socially monogamous mating systems, because females may end up without a partner and forego reproduction, especially when many females prefer the same few partners (frequency-dependent selection). Here, we quantify the fitness costs of having mating preferences that are difficult to satisfy, by manipulating the availability of preferred males. We capitalize on the recent discovery that female zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) prefer males of familiar song dialect. We measured female fitness in captive breeding colonies in which one-third of females were given ample opportunity to choose a mate of their preferred dialect (two-thirds of all males; “relaxed competition”), while two-thirds of the females had to compete over a limited pool of mates they preferred (one-third of all males; “high competition”). As expected, social pairings were strongly assortative with regard to song dialect. In the high-competition group, 26% of the females remained unpaired, yet they still obtained relatively high fitness by using brood parasitism as an alternative reproductive tactic. Another 31% of high-competition females paired disassortatively for song dialect. These females showed increased levels of extra-pair paternity, mostly with same-dialect males as sires, suggesting that preferences were not abolished after social pairing. However, females that paired disassortatively for song dialect did not have lower reproductive success. Overall, females in the high-competition group reached equal fitness to those that experienced relaxed competition. Our study suggests that alternative reproductive tactics such as egg dumping can help overcome the frequency-dependent costs of being selective in a monogamous mating system, thereby facilitating the evolution of female choosiness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An altered balance of integrated and segregated brain activity is a marker of cognitive deficits following sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan E. Cross, Florence B. Pomares, Alex Nguyen, Aurore A. Perrault, Aude Jegou, Makoto Uji, Kangjoo Lee, Fatemeh Razavipour, Obaï Bin Ka’b Ali, Umit Aydin, Habib Benali, Christophe Grova, Thien Thanh Dang-Vu</p>

Sleep deprivation (SD) leads to impairments in cognitive function. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive changes in the sleep-deprived brain can be explained by information processing within and between large-scale cortical networks. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of 20 healthy volunteers during attention and executive tasks following a regular night of sleep, a night of SD, and a recovery nap containing nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, SD was associated with increased cortex-wide functional integration, driven by a rise of integration within cortical networks. The ratio of within versus between network integration in the cortex increased further in the recovery nap, suggesting that prolonged wakefulness drives the cortex towards a state resembling sleep. This balance of integration and segregation in the sleep-deprived state was tightly associated with deficits in cognitive performance. This was a distinct and better marker of cognitive impairment than conventional indicators of homeostatic sleep pressure, as well as the pronounced thalamocortical connectivity changes that occurs towards falling asleep. Importantly, restoration of the balance between segregation and integration of cortical activity was also related to performance recovery after the nap, demonstrating a bidirectional effect. These results demonstrate that intra- and interindividual differences in cortical network integration and segregation during task performance may play a critical role in vulnerability to cognitive impairment in the sleep-deprived state.

                We report a 29-year-old, HIV-positive woman being treated with antipsychotic medication for psychosis (Clopixol 200mg intramuscularly monthly, Risperidone 2mg orally daily Haloperidol 2.5mg twice a day), who presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. She was also receiving lorazepam and sodium valproate. The patient was referred to our department as she had developed involuntary upper limb movements and simple permanent focal seizure on the lower part of the left hemiface. Clinically the patient had altered consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, and rigidity. Her blood tests showed elevated creatine kinase (1467U/L) but no leucocytosis. We did a thorough workup for other causes of such a presentation. A comprehensive history was taken from the family to exclude other medications used. Her cerebrospinal fluid results were average. Blood tests did not show evidence of infection or other abnormalities. Computed tomography brain was normal. The patient died a few days after the beginning of the attack, which we have also observed  in other HIV-female patients. As far as we know, it is the first report about this comorbidity reported in the medical literature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lightning safety awareness level in Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest lightning flash density globally. While sufficiency of lightning protection system is crucial to ensure human safety against lightning strikes, the public awareness towards lightning safety is also equally important in Malaysia. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the current lightning safety awareness level of the Malaysian population. Methods: An online questionnaire survey which consists of 22 scientific statements of lightning was first developed in Malay and English. The questionnaire allows the respondent to also check their own score upon completion of the questionnaire. It was then distributed to the public for data collection. The sample size comprised of both genders, all layers of society from various educational level and social background. Results: Overall, the awareness on lightning safety amongst Malaysian is at moderate level with an average score of slightly above 50%. Urbanites scored marginally better than their rural counterparts. One’s education level does not dictate their awareness level of lightning safety. Discussion: In conclusion, the public in Malaysia needs to be better educated on lightning safety. Similar studies should be replicated in other countries experiencing similar levels of lightning activity to better understand the public’s perception on lightning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of electrocardiogram: numerical vs. image data for emotion recognition system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a physiological signal used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease, usually using ECG wave images. Numerous studies have proven that ECG can be used to detect human emotions using numerical data; however, ECG is typically captured as a wave image rather than as a numerical data. There is still no consensus on the effect of the ECG input format (either as an image or a numerical value) on the accuracy of the emotion recognition system (ERS). The ERS using ECG images is still inadequately studied. Therefore, this study compared ERS performance using ECG image and ECG numerical data to determine the effect of the ECG input format on the ERS. Methods: This study employed the DREAMER dataset, which contains 23 ECG recordings obtained during audio-visual emotional elicitation. Numerical data was converted to ECG images for the comparison. Numerous approaches were used to obtain ECG features. The Augsburg BioSignal Toolbox (AUBT) and the Toolbox for Emotional feature extraction from Physiological signals (TEAP) extracted features from numerical data. Meanwhile, features were extracted from image data using Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), KAZE, Accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE), Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Dimension reduction was accomplished using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and valence and arousal were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The experimental results indicated that numerical data achieved arousal and valence accuracy of 69% and 79%, respectively, which was greater than those of image data. For ECG images, the highest accuracy for arousal was 58% percent; meanwhile, the valence was 63%. Conclusions: The finding showed that numerical data provided better accuracy for ERS. However, ECG image data which shows positive potential and can be considered as an input modality for the ERS.

                Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and other dissolved gases such as the gasotransmitters H<sub>2</sub>S, CO and NO affect cell metabolism and function. To evaluate effects of dissolved gases on processes in tissue, we developed a fluidics system that controls dissolved gases while simultaneously measuring parameters of electron transport, metabolism and secretory function. We use pancreatic islets, retina and liver from rodents to highlight its ability to assess effects of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S. Protocols aimed at emulating hypoxia-reperfusion conditions resolved a previously unrecognized transient spike in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (OCR) following replenishment of O<sub>2</sub>, and tissue-specific recovery of OCR following hypoxia. The system revealed both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on insulin secretion rate from isolated islets. The unique ability of this new system to quantify metabolic state and cell function in response to precise changes in dissolved gases provides a powerful platform for cell physiologists to study a wide range of disease states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular features underlying differential SHP1/SHP2 binding of immune checkpoint receptors</a></h4>

              
                A large number of inhibitory receptors recruit SHP1 and/or SHP2, tandem-SH2-containing phosphatases, through phosphotyrosine-based motifs ITIM and ITSM. Despite the similarity, these receptors exhibit differential effector binding specificities, as exemplified by the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and BTLA, which preferentially recruit SHP2 and SHP1 respectively. The molecular basis by which structurally similar receptors discriminate SHP1 and SHP2 is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that human PD-1 and BTLA optimally bind to SHP1 and SHP2 via a bivalent, parallel mode that involves both SH2 domains of SHP1 or SHP2. PD-1 mainly uses its ITSM to prefer SHP2 over SHP1 via their C-terminal SH2 domains (cSH2): swapping SHP1-cSH2 with SHP2-cSH2 enabled PD-1:SHP1 association in T cells. In contrast, BTLA primarily utilizes its ITIM to prefer SHP1 over SHP2 via their N-terminal SH2 domains (nSH2). The ITIM of PD-1, however, appeared to be de-emphasized due to a glycine at pY+1 position. Substitution of this glycine with alanine, a residue conserved in BTLA and several SHP1-recruiting receptors, was sufficient to induce PD-1:SHP1 interaction in T cells. Finally, structural simulation and mutagenesis screening showed that SHP1 recruitment activity exhibits a bell-shaped dependence on the side chain volume of the pY+1 residue of ITIM. Collectively, we provide a molecular interpretation of the SHP1/SHP2-binding specificities of PD-1 and BTLA, with implications for the mechanisms of a large family of therapeutically relevant receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM structures of CTP synthase filaments reveal mechanism of pH-sensitive assembly during budding yeast starvation</a></h4>

              
                Many metabolic enzymes self-assemble into micron-scale filaments to organize and regulate metabolism. The appearance of these assemblies often coincides with large metabolic changes as in development, cancer, and stress. Yeast undergo cytoplasmic acidification upon starvation, triggering the assembly of many metabolic enzymes into filaments. However, it is unclear how these filaments assemble at the molecular level and what their role is in the yeast starvation response. CTP Synthase (CTPS) assembles into metabolic filaments across many species. Here, we characterize <i>in vitro</i> polymerization and investigate <i>in vivo</i> consequences of CTPS assembly in yeast. Cryo-EM structures reveal a pH-sensitive assembly mechanism and highly ordered filament bundles that stabilize an inactive state of the enzyme, features unique to yeast CTPS. Disruption of filaments in cells with non-assembly or pH-insensitive mutations decreases growth rate, reflecting the importance of regulated CTPS filament assembly in homeotstasis.

                A longstanding hypothesis is that chromatin fiber folding mediated by interactions between nearby nucleosomes represses transcription. However, it has been difficult to determine the relationship between local chromatin fiber compaction and transcription in cells. Further, global changes in fiber diameters have not been observed, even between interphase and mitotic chromosomes. We show that an increase in the range of local inter-nucleosomal contacts in quiescent yeast drives the compaction of chromatin fibers genome-wide. Unlike actively dividing cells, inter-nucleosomal interactions in quiescent cells require a basic patch in the histone H4 tail. This quiescence-specific fiber folding globally represses transcription and inhibits chromatin loop extrusion by condensin. These results reveal that global changes in chromatin fiber compaction can occur during cell state transitions, and establish physiological roles for local chromatin fiber folding in regulating transcription and chromatin domain formation.

                Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a highly conserved mechanism for motor-driven transport of cargo within cilia, but how this cargo is selectively transported to cilia is unclear. WDR35/IFT121 is a component of the IFT-A complex best known for its role in ciliary retrograde transport. In the absence of WDR35, small mutant cilia form but fail to enrich in diverse classes of ciliary membrane proteins. In <i>Wdr35 </i>mouse mutants, the non-core IFT-A components are degraded and core components accumulate at the ciliary base. We reveal deep sequence homology of WDR35 and other IFT-A subunits to α and ß' COPI coatomer subunits, and demonstrate an accumulation of 'coat-less' vesicles which fail to fuse with <i>Wdr35</i> mutant cilia. We determine that recombinant non-core IFT-As can bind directly to lipids and provide the first <i>in-situ</i> evidence of a novel coat function for WDR35, likely with other IFT-A proteins, in delivering ciliary membrane cargo necessary for cilia elongation.

                Acoustic overexposure and aging can damage auditory synapses in the inner ear by a process known as synaptopathy. These insults may also damage hair bundles and the sensory transduction apparatus in auditory hair cells. However, a connection between sensory transduction and synaptopathy has not been established. To evaluate potential contributions of sensory transduction to synapse formation and development, we assessed inner hair cell synapses in several genetic models of dysfunctional sensory transduction, including mice lacking Transmembrane Channel-like (<i>Tmc</i>) <i>1</i>, <i>Tmc2</i> or both, in <i>Beethoven </i>mice which carry a dominant <i>Tmc1 </i>mutation and in <i>Spinner </i>mice which carry a recessive mutation in Transmembrane inner ear (<i>Tmie)</i>. Our analyses reveal loss of synapses in the absence of sensory transduction and preservation of synapses in <i>Tmc1</i>-null mice following restoration of sensory transduction via <i>Tmc1 </i>gene therapy. These results provide insight into the requirement of sensory transduction for hair cell synapse development and maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multivesicular Release Increases the Efficiency of InformationTransmission at Sensory Synapses</a></h4>

              
                The statistics of vesicle release determine how information is transferred in neural circuits. The classical model is of Poisson synapses releasing vesicles independently but ribbon synapses transmit early sensory signals by multivesicular release (MVR) when two or more vesicles are coordinated as a single synaptic event. To investigate the impact of MVR on the spike code we used leaky integrate-and-fire models with inputs simulating the statistics of vesicle release measured experimentally from retinal bipolar cells. Comparing these with models of independent release we find that MVR increases spike generation and the efficiency of information transfer (bits per spike) over a range of conditions that mimic retinal ganglion cells of different time-constant receiving different number of synaptic inputs of different strengths. When a single input drives a neuron with short time-constant, as occurs when hair cells transmit auditory signals, MVR increases information transfer whenever spike generation requires depolarization greater than that caused by a single vesicle. This study demonstrates how presynaptic integration of vesicles by MVR can compensate for less effective summation post-synaptically to increase the efficiency with which sensory information is transmitted at the synapse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor response vigour and fixations reflect subjective preferences during intertemporal choice</a></h4>

              
                Value-based decision-making is of central interest in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, as well as in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders characterised by decision-making impairments. Studies examining (neuro-)computational mechanisms underlying choice behaviour typically focus on participants' decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that option valuation might also be reflected in motor response vigour and eye movements, implicit measures of subjective utility. To examine motor response vigour and visual fixation correlates of option valuation in intertemporal choice, we set up a task where the participants selected an option by pressing a grip force transducer, simultaneously tracking fixation shifts between options. As outlined in our preregistration (https://osf.io/k6jct), we used hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model the choices assuming hyperbolic discounting, compared variants of the softmax and drift diffusion model, and assessed the relationship between response vigour and the estimated model parameters. The behavioural data were best explained by a drift diffusion model specifying a non-linear scaling of the drift rate by the subjective value differences. Replicating previous findings (Green et al., 1997; Wagner et al., 2020a), we found a magnitude effect for temporal discounting, such that higher rewards were discounted less. This magnitude effect was further reflected in response vigour, such that stronger forces were exerted in the high vs. the low magnitude condition. Bayesian hierarchical linear regression further revealed higher grip forces, faster response times and a lower number of fixation shifts for trials with higher subjective value differences. Our data suggest that subjective utility or implicit valuation is reflected in response vigour during intertemporal choice. Taking into account response vigour might thus provide deeper insight into decision-making, reward valuation and maladaptive changes in these processes, e.g. in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-Volume Associations in Cerebellar Regions by Sex and Reproductive Stage</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The cerebellum has established associations with motor function and a well-recognized role in cognition. In advanced age, cognitive and motor impairments contribute to reduced quality of life and are more common. Regional cerebellar volume is associated with performance across these domains and sex hormones may influence this volume. Examining sex differences in regional cerebellar volume in conjunction with age, and in the context of reproductive stage stands to improve our understanding of cerebellar aging and pathology. Methods: Data from 530 healthy adults (ages 18-88; 49% female) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience database were used here. CERES was utilized to assess lobular volume in T1-weighted images. We examined sex differences in adjusted regional cerebellar volume while controlling for age. A subgroup (n = 354, 50% female) was used to assess group differences in female reproductive stages as compared to age-matched males. Results: Sex differences in adjusted volume were seen across most anterior and posterior cerebellar lobules. The majority of cerebellar regions had significant linear relationships with age in males and females. However, there were no interactions between sex and reproductive stage groups (i.e., female reproductive stage did not display a relationship with regional cerebellar volume). Discussion: We found sex differences in volume across much of the cerebellum, linear associations with age, and did not find an effect of female reproductive stage on regional cerebellar volume. Longitudinal investigation into hormonal influences on cerebellar structure and function is warranted as hormonal changes with menopause may impact structure over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glioma synapses recruit mechanisms of adaptive plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system plays an increasingly appreciated role in the regulation of cancer. In malignant gliomas, neuronal activity drives tumor progression not only through paracrine signaling factors such as neuroligin-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but also through electrophysiologically functional neuron-to-glioma synapses. Malignant synapses are mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors in both pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas, and consequent depolarization of the glioma cell membrane drives tumor proliferation. The nervous system exhibits plasticity of both synaptic connectivity and synaptic strength, contributing to neural circuit form and functions. In health, one factor that promotes plasticity of synaptic connectivity and strength is activity-regulated secretion of the neurotrophin BDNF. Here, we show that malignant synapses exhibit similar plasticity regulated by BDNF-TrkB (tropomyosin receptor kinase B) signaling. Signaling through the receptor TrkB, BDNF promotes AMPA receptor trafficking to the glioma cell membrane, resulting in increased amplitude of glutamate-evoked currents in the malignant cells. This potentiation of malignant synaptic strength shares mechanistic features with the long-term potentiation (LTP) that is thought to contribute to memory and learning in the healthy brain. BDNF-TrkB signaling also regulates the number of neuron-to-glioma synapses. Abrogation of activity-regulated BDNF secretion from the brain microenvironment or loss of TrkB in human glioma cells exerts growth inhibitory effects in vivo and in neuron:glioma co-cultures that cannot be explained by classical growth factor signaling alone. Blocking TrkB genetically or pharmacologically abrogates these effects of BDNF on glioma synapses and substantially prolongs survival in xenograft models of pediatric glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Taken together, these findings indicate that BDNF-TrkB signaling promotes malignant synaptic plasticity and augments tumor progression.

                We reconstructed all cell nuclei in a 3D image of a Drosophila brain acquired by serial section electron microscopy (EM). The total number of nuclei is approximately 133,000, at least 87% of which belong to neurons. Neuronal nuclei vary from several hundred down to roughly 5 cubic micrometers. Glial nuclei can be even smaller. The optic lobes contain more than two times the number of cells than the central brain. Our nuclear reconstruction serves as a spatial map and index to the cells in a Drosophila brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromodulation enables temperature robustness and coupling between fast and slow oscillator circuits in  Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Acute temperature changes can disrupt neuronal activity and coordination with severe consequences for animal behavior and survival. Nonetheless, two rhythmic neuronal circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and their coordination are maintained across a broad temperature range. However, it remains unclear how this temperature robustness is achieved. Here, we dissociate temperature effects on the rhythm generating circuits from those of upstream ganglia. We demonstrate that heat-activated factors extrinsic to the rhythm generators are essential to the slow gastric mill rhythm's temperature robustness and contribute to the temperature response of the fast pyloric rhythm. The gastric mill rhythm crashed when only the STG circuits were heated. It could be restored when upstream ganglia were heated in addition, and the activity of the peptidergic modulatory projection neuron (MCN1) increased. Correspondingly, MCN1's neuropeptide transmitter stabilized the rhythm and maintained it over a broad temperature range. Extrinsic neuromodulation is thus essential for the oscillatory circuits in the STG and enables neural circuits to maintain function in temperature-compromised conditions. In contrast, integer coupling between pyloric and gastric mill rhythms was independent of whether extrinsic inputs and STG pattern generators were temperature-matched or not, demonstrating that the temperature robustness of the coupling is enabled by properties intrinsic to the rhythm generators. However, at near-crash temperature, integer coupling was maintained only in some animals but was absent in others. This was true despite regular rhythmic activity in all animals, supporting that degenerate circuit properties result in idiosyncratic responses to environ-mental challenges.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic Perturbation of an Artificial Neural Network: A Step Towards Quantifying Causal Contributions in The Brain</a></h4>

              
                Lesion inference analysis is a fundamental approach for characterizing the causal contributions of neural elements to brain function. Historically, it has helped to localize specialized functions in the brain after brain damage, and it has gained new prominence through the arrival of modern optogenetic perturbation techniques that allow probing the functional contributions of neural circuit elements at unprecedented levels of detail. While inferences drawn from brain lesions are conceptually powerful, they face methodological difficulties due to the brain's complexity. Particularly, they are challenged to disentangle the functional contributions of individual neural elements because many elements may contribute to a particular function, and these elements may be interacting anatomically as well as functionally. Therefore, studies of real-world data, as in clinical lesion studies, are not suitable for establishing the reliability of lesion approaches due to an unknown, potentially complex ground truth. Instead, ground truth studies of well-characterized artificial systems are required. Here, we systematically and exhaustively lesioned a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN) playing a classic arcade game. We determined the functional contributions of all nodes and links, contrasting results from single-element perturbations and perturbing multiple elements simultaneously. Moreover, we computed pairwise causal functional interactions between the network elements, and looked deeper into the system's inner workings, proposing a mechanistic explanation for the effects of lesions. We found that not every perturbation necessarily reveals causation, as lesioning elements, one at a time, produced biased results. By contrast, multi-site lesion analysis captured crucial details that were missed by single-site lesions. We conclude that even small and seemingly simple ANNs show surprising complexity that needs to be understood for deriving a causal picture of the system. In the context of rapidly evolving multivariate brain-mapping approaches and inference methods, we advocate using in-silico experiments and ground-truth models to verify fundamental assumptions, technical limitations, and the scope of possible interpretations of these methods.

                Enhanced activity and overexpression of Pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels contribute to neuronal pathologies, such as epilepsy and Alzheimers disease (AD). In the hippocampus, the PANX1 channels ablation alters glutamatergic neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and memory flexibility. Nevertheless, PANX1-knockout (KO) mice still preserve the ability to learn, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms work to stabilize neuronal activity. Here, we show that the absence of PANX1 in the adult brain promotes a series of structural and functional modifications in KO hippocampal synapses, preserving spontaneous activity. Adult CA1 neurons of KO mice exhibit enhanced excitability, complex dendritic branching, spine maturation, and multiple synaptic contacts compared to the WT condition. These modifications seem to rely on the actin-cytoskeleton dynamics as an increase in actin polymerization and an imbalance between Rac1 and RhoA GTPase activity is observed in the absence of PANX1. Our findings highlight a novel interaction between PANX1, actin, and small Rho GTPases that appear to be relevant for synapse maintenance as a long-term compensatory mechanism for PANX1 deficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-Related Neurocircuitry Supporting Camouflaging in Adults with Autism: Female Protection Insights</a></h4>

              
                Background: The male preponderance in autism led to the hypothesis that aspects of female biology are protective against autism. Females with autism report engaging in more compensatory behaviors (i.e., camouflaging) to overcome autism-related social differences, which may be a downstream result of protective pathways. No studies have examined sex-related brain pathways supporting camouflaging in females with autism, despite its potential to inform mechanisms underlying the sex bias in autism. Methods: This study included 45 non-intellectually-disabled adults with autism (male/female: 21/24) and 40 neurotypical adults (male/female: 19/21) ages 18-71. We used group multivariate voxel pattern analysis to conduct a data-driven, connectome-wide characterization of "sex-atypical" (sex-by-diagnosis) and "sex-typical" (sex) brain functional connectivity features linked to camouflaging, and validated findings in females with autism multi-modally via structural connectometry. Exploratory associations with cognitive control, memory, emotion recognition, and depression/anxiety examined the adaptive nature of functional connectivity patterns supporting camouflaging in females with autism. Results: We found 1) "sex-atypical" functional connectivity patterns predicting camouflaging in the hypothalamus and precuneus and 2) "sex-typical" patterns in the anterior cingulate and right anterior parahippocampus. Higher hypothalamic functional connectivity with a limbic reward cluster was the strongest predictor of camouflaging in females with autism (a "sex-atypical" pattern), and also predicted better cognitive control/emotion recognition. Structural connectometry validated functional connectivity results with consistent brain pathways/effect patterns implicated across multi-modal findings in females with autism. Conclusion: This data-driven, connectome-wide characterization of "sex-atypical" and "sex-typical" brain connectivity features supporting compensatory social behavior in autism suggests hormones may play a role in the autism sex bias. Furthermore, both "male-typical" and "female-typical" brain connectivity patterns are implicated in camouflaging in females with autism in circuits associated with reward, emotion, and memory processing. "Sex-atypical" results are consistent with the fetal steroidogenic hypothesis, which would result in masculinized brain features in females with autism. However, female genetics/biology may contribute to "female-typical" patterns implicated in camouflaging.

                Amplitude modulation (AM) is a common feature of natural sounds, including speech and animal vocalizations. Here, we used operant conditioning and in vivo electrophysiology to determine the AM detection threshold of mice as well as its underlying neuronal encoding. Mice were trained in a Go-NoGo task to detect the transition to AM within a noise stimulus designed to prevent the use of spectral side-bands or a change in intensity as alternative cues. Our results indicate that mice, in comparison with other species, detect high modulation frequencies up to 512 Hz exceptionally well, but show poor performance at low frequencies. Our in vivo multielectrode recordings in the inferior colliculus (IC) of both anesthetized and awake mice revealed a few single units with remarkable phase-locking ability to 512 Hz modulation, but not sufficient to explain the good behavioral detection. Using a model of the population response that combined dimensionality reduction with threshold detection, we reproduced the general high-pass characteristics of behavioral detection based on a subset of neurons showing the largest firing rate change (both increase and decrease) in response to AM. Our data thus identify candidate neurons in the IC to explain the high-pass transfer function for AM detection in the mouse.

                Aging involves various neurobiological changes, although their effect on brain function in humans remains poorly understood. The growing availability of human neuronal and circuit data provides opportunities for uncovering age-dependent changes of brain networks and for constraining models to predict consequences on brain activity. Here we found increased sag current in human layer 5 pyramidal neurons from older subjects, and captured this effect in biophysical models of younger and older pyramidal neurons. We used these models to simulate detailed layer 5 microcircuits and found lower baseline firing in older pyramidal neuron microcircuits, with minimal effect on response. We then validated the predicted reduced baseline firing using extracellular multi-electrode recordings from human brain slices of different ages. Our results thus report changes in human pyramidal neuron input integration properties that can sufficiently account for age-dependent decreases in cortical resting state activity and may underpin a clinical relevance in aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral entorhinal cortex suppresses drift in cortical memory representations.</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval is thought to depend on the reinstatement of cortical memory representations guided by pattern completion processes in the hippocampus. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the intermediary regions supporting hippocampal-cortical interactions and houses neurons that prospectively signal past events in a familiar environment. To investigate the functional relevance of the LEC's activity for cortical reinstatement, we pharmacologically inhibited the LEC and examined its impact on the stability of ensemble firing patterns in one of the LEC's efferent targets, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When male rats underwent multiple epochs of identical stimulus sequences in the same environment, the mPFC maintained a stable ensemble firing pattern across repetitions, particularly when the sequence included pairings of neutral and aversive stimuli. With LEC inhibition, the mPFC still formed an ensemble pattern that accurately captured stimuli and their associations within each epoch. However, LEC inhibition markedly disrupted its consistency across the epochs by decreasing the proportion of mPFC neurons that stably maintained firing selectivity for stimulus associations. Thus, the LEC stabilizes cortical representations of learned stimulus associations, thereby facilitating the recovery of the original memory trace without generating a new, redundant trace for familiar experiences. Failure of this process might underlie retrieval deficits in conditions associated with degeneration of the LEC, such as normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetry of cortical functional hierarchy in humans and macaques suggests phylogenetic conservation and adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex is symmetrically organized along large-scale axes but also presents inter-hemispheric differences in structure and function. The quantified contralateral homologous difference, i.e., asymmetry, is a key feature of the human brain left-right axis supporting functional processes, such as language. Here, we assessed whether the asymmetry of cortical functional organization is heritable and phylogenetically conserved between humans and macaques. Our findings indicate asymmetric organization along an axis describing a hierarchical functional trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition. Whereas language network showed leftward asymmetric organization, frontoparietal network showed rightward asymmetric organization. These asymmetries were heritable and comparable between humans and macaques, suggesting (phylo)genetic conservation. However, both language and frontoparietal networks showed a qualitatively larger asymmetry in humans relative to macaques and variable heritability in humans. This may reflect an evolutionary adaptation allowing for experience-dependent specialization, linked to higher-order cognitive functions uniquely developed in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Controlled and Selective Photo-oxidation of Amyloid-β Fibrils by Oligomeric p-Phenylene Ethynylenes</a></h4>

              
                Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to clear toxic amyloid aggregates involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. A major limitation of PDT is off-target oxidation, which can be lethal for the surrounding cells. We have shown that a novel class of oligo-p-phenylene ethynylene-based compounds (OPEs) exhibit selective binding and fluorescence turn-on in the presence of pre-fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates of disease-relevant proteins such as amyloid-beta (Ab) and alpha-synuclein. Concomitant with fluorescence turn-on, OPE also photosensitizes singlet oxygen under illumination through the generation of a triplet state, pointing to the potential application of OPEs as photosensitizers in PDT. Herein, we investigated the photosensitizing activity of an anionic OPE for the photo-oxidation of toxic Ab; aggregates and compared its efficacy to the well-known but non-selective photosensitizer methylene blue (MB). Our results show that while MB photo-oxidized both monomeric and fibrillar conformers of Ab40, OPE oxidized only Ab40 fibrils, targeting two histidine residues on the fibril surface and a methionine residue located in the fibril core. Oxidized fibrils were shorter and more dispersed, but retained the characteristic beta-sheet rich fibrillar structure and the ability to seed further fibril growth. Importantly, the oxidized fibrils displayed low toxicity. We have thus discovered a class of novel theranostics for the simultaneous detection and oxidization of amyloid aggregates. Importantly, the selectivity of OPE's photosensitizing activity overcomes the limitation of off-target oxidation of currently available photosensitizers, and represents a significant advancement of PDT as a viable strategy to treat neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">miR-409-3p represses Cited2 at the evolutionary emergence of the callosal and corticospinal projections</a></h4>

              
                Callosal projection neurons are a broad population of interhemispheric projection neurons that extend an axon across the corpus callosum to connect the two cerebral hemispheres. The corticospinal tract, comprised of the axons of corticospinal projection neurons, is unique to mammals, and its full extension to the lumbar segments that control walking is, like the corpus callosum, unique to placental mammals. The emergence of these two distinct axonal tracts is thought to underpin the evolutionary expansion of complex motor and cognitive abilities. The molecular mechanisms regulating the divergence of corticospinal and callosal projection neurons are incompletely understood. Our recent work identifies a genomic cluster of microRNAs (12qF1/Mirg) unique to placental mammals. These clustered miRNAs are specifically expressed by corticospinal vs. callosal projection neurons during the molecular refinement of corticospinal vs. callosal projection neuron fate (1). One of these, miR-409-3p, can convert layer V callosal into corticospinal projection neurons, acting in part through repression of the callosal-expressed transcriptional regulator Lmo4. This conversion is partial, however, suggesting that miR-409-3p represses multiple callosal projection neuron control genes in order to specify corticospinal projection neurons. One potential additional target of miR-409-3p repression is the callosal-expressed transcriptional co-activator Cited2. Cited2 interacts genetically with Lmo4, and Lmo4 can partially functionally compensate for Cited2 in thymus development(2). Further, Cited2 and Lmo4 function as opposing molecular controls over specific areal identity within superficial layer callosal projection neurons of the somatosensory and motor cortices, respectively (3). Cited2 is highly expressed by callosal, relative to corticospinal, projection neurons from the earliest stages of neurogenesis. Cited2 is necessary for the expansion of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ), and the resulting generation of superficial layer callosal projection neurons. Here we show that miR-409-3p and Cited2 interact in IPCs and in corticospinal vs. deep layer callosal projection neuron development. miR-409-3p represses the Cited2 3UTR in luciferase assays. Mirg, which encodes miR-409-3p, and Cited2, are reciprocally expressed in IPCs at e15.5 by qPCR. Furthermore, miR-409-3p gain-of-function results in a phenocopy of established Cited2 loss-of-function in IPCs. Later on, miR-409-3p and Cited2 exert opposing effects on the adoption of corticospinal vs. callosal projection neuron subtype identity. Taken together, our work suggests that miR-409-3p, and possibly other 12qF1 miRNAs, represses Cited2 in IPCs to limit their proliferation, and in developing corticospinal and deep layer callosal projection neurons to favor corticospinal fate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemical inhibition of pathological reactive astrocytes promotes neural protection</a></h4>

              
                Disease, injury, and aging induce reactive astrocyte states with pathological functions. In neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory reactive astrocytes are abundant and contribute to progressive cell loss. Modulating the state or function of these reactive astrocytes thereby represents an attractive therapeutic goal. Leveraging a cellular phenotypic screening platform, we show that chemical inhibitors of HDAC3 effectively block pathological astrocyte reactivity. Inhibition of HDAC3 reduces molecular and functional features of reactive astrocytes in vitro including inflammatory gene expression, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation. Transcriptional and chromatin mapping studies show that HDAC3 inhibition mediates a switch between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states, which disarms the pathological functions of reactive astrocytes. Systemic administration of a blood-brain barrier penetrant chemical inhibitor of HDAC3, RGFP966, blocks reactive astrocyte formation and promotes axonal protection in vivo. Collectively, these results establish a platform for discovering chemical modulators of reactive astrocyte states, inform the mechanisms controlling astrocyte reactivity, and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of modulating astrocyte reactivity for neurodegenerative diseases.

                Establishing with precision the quantity and identity of the cell types of the brain is a prerequisite for a detailed compendium of gene and protein expression in the central nervous system. Currently however, strict quantitation of cell numbers has been achieved only for the nervous system of C.elegans. Here we describe the development of a synergistic pipeline of molecular genetic, imaging, and computational technologies designed to allow high-throughput, precise quantitation with cellular resolution of reporters of gene expression in intact whole tissues with complex cellular constitutions such as the brain. We have deployed the approach to determine with exactitude the number of functional neurons and glia in the entire intact Drosophila larval brain, revealing fewer neurons and many more glial cells than previously estimated. Moreover, we discover an unexpected divergence between the sexes at this juvenile developmental stage, with female brains having significantly more neurons than males. Topological analysis of our data establishes that this sexual dimorphism extends to deeper features of brain organisation. Our methodology enables robust and accurate quantification of the number and positioning of cells within intact organs, facilitating sophisticated analysis of cellular identity, diversity, and expression characteristics.

                Color and motion are used by many species to identify salient moving objects. They are processed largely independently, but color contributes to motion processing in humans, for example, enabling moving colored objects to be detected when their luminance matches the background. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected, additional contribution of color to motion vision in Drosophila. We show that behavioral ON-motion responses are more sensitive to UV than for OFF-motion, and we identify cellular pathways connecting UV-sensitive R7 photoreceptors to ON and OFF-motion-sensitive T4 and T5 cells, using neurogenetics and calcium imaging. Remarkably, the synergy of color and motion vision enhances the detection of approaching UV discs, but not green discs with the same chromatic contrast, and we show how this generalizes for visual systems with ON and OFF pathways. Our results provide a computational and circuit basis for how color enhances motion vision to favor the detection of saliently colored objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparison of single and multi-echo processing of fMRI data during overt autobiographical recall</a></h4>

              
                Recent years have seen an increase in the use of multi-echo fMRI designs by cognitive neuroscientists. Acquiring multiple echoes allows one to reduce thermal noise and identify nuisance signal components in BOLD data (Kundu et al., 2012). At the same time, multi-echo acquisitions increase data processing complexity and may incur a cost to the temporal and spatial resolution of the acquired data. Here, we re-examine a multi-echo dataset (Gilmore et al., 2021) analyzed using multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA) and focused on hippocampal activity during the overly spoken recall of recent and remote autobiographical memories. The goal of the present series of analyses was to determine if ME-ICA's theoretical denoising benefits might lead to a practical difference in the overall conclusions reached. Compared to single echo data, ME-ICA led to qualitatively different conclusions regarding hippocampal contributions to autobiographical recall: whereas the single echo analysis largely failed to reveal hippocampal activity relative to an active baseline, ME-ICA results supported predictions of the Standard Model of Consolidation and a time limited hippocampal involvement (Alvarez and Squire, 1994). These data provide a practical example of the benefits multi-echo denoising in a naturalistic memory paradigm and demonstrate how they can be used to address long-standing theoretical questions.

                We describe how the recently introduced method of significant subgraph mining can be employed as a useful tool in network comparison. It is applicable whenever the goal is to compare two sets of unweighted graphs and to determine differences in the processes that generate them. We provide an extension of the method to dependent graph generating processes as the occur for example in within-subject experimental designs. Furthermore, we present an extensive investigation of error-statistical properties of the method in simulation using Erdos-Renyi models and in empirical data. In particular, we perform an empirical power analysis for transfer entropy networks inferred from resting state MEG data comparing autism spectrum patients with neurotypical controls. From this analysis one may estimate that the appropriate sample size for similar studies should be chosen in the order of n=60 per group or larger.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cone-driven retinal responses are shaped by rod but not cone HCN1</a></h4>

              
                Signal integration of converging neural circuits is poorly understood. One example is in the retina where the integration of rod and cone signaling is responsible for the large dynamic range of vision. The relative contribution of rods versus cones is dictated by a complex function involving background light intensity and stimulus temporal frequency. One understudied mechanism involved in coordinating rod and cone signaling onto the shared retinal circuit is the hyperpolarization activated current (Ih) mediated by HCN1 channels. Ih opposes membrane hyperpolarization driven by activation of the phototransduction cascade and modulates the strength and kinetics of the photoreceptor voltage response. We examined conditional knockout of HCN1 from rods using electroretinography. In the absence of HCN1, rod responses are prolonged in dim light which altered the response to slow modulation of light intensity both at the level of retinal signaling and behavior. Under brighter intensities, cone-driven signaling was suppressed. To our surprise, conditional knockout of HCN1 from cones had no effect on cone-mediated signaling. We propose that Ih is dispensable in cones due to the high level of temporal control of cone phototransduction. Thus, HCN1 is required for cone-driven retinal signaling only indirectly by modulating the voltage response of rods to limit their output.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcription factor control of dendrite targeting via combinatorial cell-surface codes</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors are central commanders specifying cell fate, morphology, and physiology while cell-surface proteins execute these commands through interaction with cellular environment. In developing neurons, it is presumed that transcription factors control wiring specificity through regulation of cell-surface protein expression. However, the number and identity of cell-surface protein(s) a transcription factor regulates remain largely unclear1,2. Also unknown is whether a transcription factor regulates the same or different cell-surface proteins in different neuron types to specify their connectivity. Here we use a lineage-defining transcription factor, Acj6 (ref. 3), to investigate how it controls precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs). Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion proteins and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo-whose channel activity is dispensable for its wiring function. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combinatorial expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, a key transcription factor controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Challenging the notion of a task-negative network: default mode network involvement under varying levels of cognitive effort</a></h4>

              
                Everyday cognitive functioning is characterized by constant alternations between different modes of information processing, driven by fluctuations in environmental demands. At the neural level, this is realized through corresponding dynamic shifts in functional activation and network connectivity. A distinction is often made between the Default Mode Network (DMN) as a task-negative network that is upregulated in the absence of cognitive demands, and task-positive networks that are upregulated when cognitive demands such as attention and executive control are present. Such networks have been labelled the Extrinsic Mode Network (EMN). We investigated changes in brain activation and functional network connectivity during repeated alternations between levels of cognitive effort. Using fMRI and a block-design Stroop paradigm, participants switched back and forth between periods of no effort (resting), low effort (word reading, automatic processing) and high effort (color naming, cognitive control). Results showed expected EMN-activation for task versus rest, and likewise expected DMN-activation for rest versus task. The DMN was also more strongly activated during low effort contrasted with high effort, suggesting a gradual up- and down-regulation of the DMN, depending on the level of demand. The often reported anti-correlation between DMN and EMN was only present during periods of low effort, indicating intermittent contributions of both networks. These results challenge the traditional view of the DMN as solely a task-negative network. Instead, the present results suggest that both EMN and DMN may contribute to low-effort cognitive processing. In contrast, periods of resting and high effort are dominated by the DMN and EMN, respectively.

                This paper presents a deep-learning based workflow to detect synapses and predict their neurotransmitter type in the primitive chordate Ciona intestinalis (Ciona) EM images. Identifying synapses from electron microscopy (EM) images to build a full map of connections between neurons is a labor-intensive process and requires significant domain expertise. Automation of synapse detection and classification would hasten the generation and analysis of connectomes. Furthermore, inferences concerning neuron type and function from synapse features are in many cases difficult to make. Finding the connection between synapse structure and function is an important step in fully understanding a connectome. Activation maps derived from the convolutional neural network provide insights on important features of synapses based on cell type and function. The main contribution of this work is in the differentiation of synapses by neurotransmitter type through the structural information in their EM images. This enables prediction of neurotransmitter types for neurons in Ciona which were previously unknown. The prediction model with code is available on Github.

                Visual categorization is a human core cognitive capacity that depends on the development of visual category representations in the infant brain. The nature of infant visual category representations and their relationship to the corresponding adult form however remain unknown. Our results clarify the nature of visual category representations in 6- to 8-month-old infants and their developmental trajectory towards adult maturity in the key characteristics temporal dynamics, representational format, and spectral properties. Temporal dynamics change from slowly emerging, developing representations in infants to quickly emerging, complex representations in adults. Despite those differences infants and adults already partly share visual category representations. The format of infants' representations are visual features of low to intermediate complexity, whereas adults' representations also encoded high complexity features. Theta band neural oscillations form the basis of visual category representations in infants, and these representations are shifted to the alpha/beta band in adults.

                Forming a complete picture of the relationship between neural activity and body kinetics requires quantification of skeletal joint biomechanics during behavior. However, without detailed knowledge of the underlying skeletal motion, inferring joint kinetics from surface tracking approaches is difficult, especially for animals where the relationship between surface anatomy and skeleton changes during motion. Here we developed a videography-based method enabling detailed three-dimensional kinetic quantification of an anatomically defined skeleton in untethered freely-behaving animals. This skeleton-based model has been constrained by anatomical principles and joint motion limits and provided skeletal pose estimates for a range of rodent sizes, even when limbs were occluded. Model-inferred joint kinetics for both gait and gap-crossing behaviors were verified by direct measurement of limb placement, showing that complex decision making behaviors can be accurately reconstructed at the level of skeletal kinetics using our anatomically constrained model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Validating the wearable MUSE headset for EEG spectral analysis and Frontal Alpha Asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                EEG power spectral density (PSD), the individual alpha frequency (IAF) and the frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) are all EEG spectral measures that have been widely used to evaluate cognitive and attentional processes in experimental and clinical settings, and that can be used for real-world applications (e.g., remote EEG monitoring, brain-computer interfaces, neurofeedback, neuromodulation, etc.). Potential applications remain limited by the high cost, low mobility, and long preparation times associated with high-density EEG recording systems. Low-density wearable systems address these issues and can increase access to larger and diversified samples. The present study tested whether a low-cost, 4-channel wearable EEG system (the MUSE) could be used to quickly measure continuous EEG data, yielding similar frequency components compared to research a grade EEG system (the 64-channel BIOSEMI Active Two). We compare the spectral measures from MUSE EEG data referenced to mastoids to those from BIOSEMI EEG data with two different references for validation. A minimal amount of data was deliberately collected to test the feasibility for real-world applications (EEG setup and data collection being completed in under 5 min). We show that the MUSE can be used to examine power spectral density (PSD) in all frequency bands, the individual alpha frequency (IAF; i.e., peak alpha frequency and alpha center of gravity), and frontal alpha asymmetry. Furthermore, we observed satisfying internal consistency reliability in alpha power and asymmetry measures recorded with the MUSE. Estimating asymmetry on PAF and CoG frequencies did not yield significant advantages relative to the traditional method (whole alpha band). These findings should advance human neurophysiological monitoring using wearable neurotechnologies in large participant samples and increase the feasibility of their implementation in real-world settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A high-fat diet changes astrocytic metabolism to enhance synaptic plasticity and promote exploratory behavior</a></h4>

              
                A high-fat diet (HFD) is generally considered to negatively influence the body, the brain, and cognitive abilities. On the other hand, fat and fatty acids are essential for nourishing and constructing brain tissue. Astrocytes are central for lipolysis and fatty acids metabolism. Here we show that exposure of young mice to one month of HFD elevates lipid content and increases the relative amount of reduced cytochromes in astrocytes but not in neurons. Metabolic changes were paralleled with an enlargement of astrocytic territorial domains due to an increased outgrowth of branches and leaflets. Astrocyte remodeling was associated with an increase in expression of ezrin and with no changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), and glutamine synthetase (GS). Such physiological (non-reactive) enlargement of astrocytes in the brain active milieu promoted glutamate clearance and long-term potentiation. These changes translated into improved exploratory behavior. Thus, dietary fat intake is not invariably harmful and might exert beneficial effects depending on the biological context.

                The joint analysis of imaging-genetics data facilitates the systematic investigation of genetic effects on brain structures and functions with spatial specificity. We focus on voxel-wise genome-wide association analysis, which may involve trillions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-voxel pairs. We attempt to identify underlying organized association patterns of SNP-voxel pairs and understand the polygenic and pleiotropic networks on brain imaging traits. We propose a bi-clique graph structure (i.e., a set of SNPs highly correlated with a cluster of voxels) for the systematic association pattern. Next, we develop computational strategies to detect latent SNP-voxel bi-cliques and inference model for statistical testing. We further provide theoretical results to guarantee the accuracy of our computational algorithms and statistical inference. We validate our method by extensive simulation studies and then apply it to the whole genome genetic and voxel-level white matter integrity data collected from 1052 participants of the human connectome project (HCP). The results demonstrate multiple genetic loci influencing white matter integrity measures on splenium and genu of the corpus callosum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine mediates the bidirectional update of interval timing</a></h4>

              
                The role of dopamine as a reward prediction error signal in reinforcement learning tasks has been well-established over the past decades. Recent work has shown that the reward prediction error interpretation can also account for the effects of dopamine on interval timing by controlling the speed of subjective time. According to this theory, the timing of the dopamine signal relative to reward delivery dictates whether subjective time speeds up or slows down: Early DA signals speed up subjective time and late signals slow it down. To test this bidirectional prediction, we reanalyzed measurements of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of mice performing a self-timed movement task. Using the slope of ramping dopamine activity as a read-out of subjective time speed, we found that trial-by-trial changes in the slope could be predicted from the timing of dopamine activity on the previous trial. This result provides a key piece of evidence supporting a unified computational theory of reinforcement learning and interval timing.

	<p>Corpus callosotomy (CC) is an established palliative surgery for human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), especially those with generalized seizures and multiple or unknown epileptogenic focus. However, there are no reports to describe CC in canine patients with epilepsy. Three client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with DRE are included in this case series. In presurgical evaluations, an apparent epileptogenic zone was not detected in each dog and CC was conducted. Total CC was performed in one dog, whereas the other two received partial CC. One dog recovered from surgery without any complications, but died suddenly by an unknown cause at 10 h after surgery. For the other two dogs, postoperative evaluations including seizure outcomes, complications, and quality of life of the dogs and owners were assessed for at least 12 months. Both dogs showed a remarkable decrease in seizure frequency (averaged 80.3% reduction) and severity after surgery. The antiseizure medications were maintained, and not only the mentation and activity of the dogs, but also the quality of life of dogs and owners were improved postoperatively. Although technical improvement and more large-scale studies are needed, CC is a treatment option for dogs with DRE in veterinary medicine.</p>

                Turbulence generally arises in shear flows if velocities and hence, inertial forces are sufficiently large. In striking contrast, viscoelastic fluids can exhibit disordered motion even at vanishing inertia. Intermediate between these cases, a state of chaotic motion, “elastoinertial turbulence” (EIT), has been observed in a narrow Reynolds number interval. We...

                <p>Stimulatory coupling of dopamine D<SUB>1</SUB> (D<SUB>1</SUB>R) and adenosine A<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>2A</SUB>R) to adenylyl cyclase within the striatum is mediated through a specific G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer to ultimately modulate motor behaviors. To dissect the individual roles of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer in different populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), we produced and characterized conditional mouse models, in which the <I>Gng7</I> gene was deleted in either the D<SUB>1</SUB>R- or A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-expressing MSNs. We show that conditional loss of <SUB>7</SUB> disrupts the cell type-specific assembly of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer, thereby identifying its circumscribed roles acting downstream of either the D<SUB>1</SUB>Rs or A<SUB>2A</SUB>Rs in coordinating motor behaviors, including <I>in vivo</I> responses to psychostimulants. We reveal that G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>/cAMP signal in D<SUB>1</SUB>R-MSNs does not impact spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor behaviors in male and female mice, while its loss in A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-MSNs results in a hyperlocomotor phenotype and enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine. Additionally, G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>/cAMP signal in either D<SUB>1</SUB>R- or A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-expressing MSNs is not required for the activation of PKA signaling by amphetamine. Finally, we show that G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> signaling acting downstream of D<SUB>1</SUB>Rs is selectively implicated in the acute locomotor-enhancing effects of morphine. Collectively, these results support the general notion that receptors use specific G&alpha;&beta; proteins to direct the fidelity of downstream signaling pathways and to elicit a diverse repertoire of cellular functions. Specifically, these findings highlight the critical role for the <SUB>7</SUB> protein in determining the cellular level, and hence, the function of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer in several disease states associated with dysfunctional striatal signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunction or imbalance of cAMP signaling in the striatum has been linked to several neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dystonia, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. By genetically targeting the <SUB>7</SUB> subunit in distinct striatal neuronal subpopulations in mice, we demonstrate that the formation and function of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer, which represents the rate-limiting step for cAMP production in the striatum, is selectively disrupted. Furthermore, we reveal cell type-specific roles for G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>-mediated cAMP production in the control of spontaneous locomotion as well as behavioral and molecular responses to psychostimulants. Our findings identify the <SUB>7</SUB> protein as a novel therapeutic target for disease states associated with dysfunctional striatal cAMP signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Metaplastic Reinforcement of Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal Area CA2 by Cholinergic Receptor Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal CA2, an inconspicuously positioned area between the well-studied CA1 and CA3 subfields, has captured research interest in recent years because of its role in social memory formation. However, the role of cholinergic inputs to the CA2 area for the regulation of synaptic plasticity remains to be fully understood. We show that cholinergic receptor activation with the nonselective cholinergic agonist, carbachol (CCh), triggers a protein synthesis-dependent and NMDAR-independent long-term synaptic depression (CCh-LTD) at entorhinal cortical (EC)-CA2 and Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA2 synapses in the hippocampus of adult male Wistar rats. The activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) is critical for the induction of CCh-LTD with the results suggesting an involvement of M3 and M1 mAChRs in the early facilitation of CCh-LTD, while nicotinic AChR activation plays a role in the late maintenance of CCh-LTD at CA2 synapses. Remarkably, we find that CCh priming lowers the threshold for the subsequent induction of persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission at EC-CA2 and the plasticity-resistant SC-CA2 pathways. The effects of such a cholinergic-dependent synaptic depression on subsequent LTP at EC-CA2 and SC-CA2 synapses have not been previously explored. Collectively, the results demonstrate that CA2 synaptic learning rules are regulated in a metaplastic manner, whereby modifications triggered by prior cholinergic stimulation can dictate the outcome of future plasticity events. Moreover, the reinforcement of LTP at EC inputs to CA2 following the priming stimulus coexists with concurrent sustained CCh-LTD at the SC-CA2 pathway and is dynamically scaled by modulation of SC-CA2 synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The release of the neuromodulator acetylcholine is critically involved in processes of hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Cholinergic afferents originating in the medial septum and diagonal bands of Broca terminating in the hippocampal area CA2 might play an important role in the modulation of area-specific synaptic plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that cholinergic receptor activation induces an LTD of synaptic transmission at entorhinal cortical- and Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses. This cholinergic activation-mediated LTD displays a bidirectional metaplastic switch to LTP on a future timescale. This suggests that such bidirectional synaptic modifications triggered by the dynamic modulation of tonic cholinergic receptor activation may support the formation of CA2-dependent memories given the increased hippocampal cholinergic tone during active wakefulness observed in exploratory behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CNS Hypomyelination Disrupts Axonal Conduction and Behavior in Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelination is essential for central nervous system (CNS) formation, health and function. As a model organism, larval zebrafish have been extensively employed to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of CNS myelination, because of their genetic tractability and suitability for non-invasive live cell imaging. However, it has not been assessed to what extent CNS myelination affects neural circuit function in zebrafish larvae, prohibiting the integration of molecular and cellular analyses of myelination with concomitant network maturation. To test whether larval zebrafish might serve as a suitable platform with which to study the effects of CNS myelination and its dysregulation on circuit function, we generated zebrafish myelin regulatory factor (<I>myrf</I>) mutants with CNS-specific hypomyelination and investigated how this affected their axonal conduction properties and behavior. We found that <I>myrf</I> mutant larvae exhibited increased latency to perform startle responses following defined acoustic stimuli. Furthermore, we found that hypomyelinated animals often selected an impaired response to acoustic stimuli, exhibiting a bias toward reorientation behavior instead of the stimulus-appropriate startle response. To begin to study how myelination affected the underlying circuitry, we established electrophysiological protocols to assess various conduction properties along single axons. We found that the hypomyelinated <I>myrf</I> mutants exhibited reduced action potential conduction velocity and an impaired ability to sustain high-frequency action potential firing. This study indicates that larval zebrafish can be used to bridge molecular and cellular investigation of CNS myelination with multiscale assessment of neural circuit function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelination of CNS axons is essential for their health and function, and it is now clear that myelination is a dynamic life-long process subject to modulation by neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear precisely how changes to myelination affects animal behavior and underlying action potential conduction along axons in intact neural circuits. In recent years, zebrafish have been employed to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of myelination, because of their relatively simple, optically transparent, experimentally tractable vertebrate nervous system. Here we find that changes to myelination alter the behavior of young zebrafish and action potential conduction along individual axons, providing a platform to integrate molecular, cellular, and circuit level analyses of myelination using this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Bihemispheric Reorganization of Neuronal Activity in Premotor Cortex after Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain injuries cause hemodynamic changes in several distant, spared areas from the lesion. Our objective was to better understand the neuronal correlates of this reorganization in awake, behaving female monkeys. We used reversible inactivation techniques to "injure" the primary motor cortex, while continuously recording neuronal activity of the ventral premotor cortex in the two hemispheres, before and after the onset of behavioral impairments. Inactivation rapidly induced profound alterations of neuronal discharges that were heterogeneous within each and across the two hemispheres, occurred during movements of either the affected or nonaffected arm, and varied during different phases of grasping. Our results support that extensive, and much more complex than expected, neuronal reorganization takes place in spared areas of the bihemispheric cortical network involved in the control of hand movements. This broad pattern of reorganization offers potential targets that should be considered for the development of neuromodulation protocols applied early after brain injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that brain injuries cause changes in several distant, spared areas of the network, often in the premotor cortex. This reorganization is greater early after the injury and the magnitude of early changes correlates with impairments. However, studies to date have used noninvasive brain imaging approaches or have been conducted in sedated animals. Therefore, we do not know how brain injuries specifically affect the activity of neurons during the generation of movements. Our study clearly shows how a lesion rapidly impacts neurons in the premotor cortex of both hemispheres. A better understanding of these complex changes can help formulate hypotheses for the development of new treatments that specifically target neuronal reorganization induced by lesions in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Inputs in the Prelimbic Cortex Curb Fear after Extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>In contrast to easily formed fear memories, fear extinction requires prolonged training. The prelimbic cortex (PL), which integrates signals from brain structures involved in fear conditioning and extinction such as the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and the basolateral amygdala (BL), is necessary for fear memory retrieval. Little is known, however, about how the vHIP and BL inputs to the PL regulate the display of fear after fear extinction. Using functional anatomy tracing in male rats, we found two distinct subpopulations of neurons in the PL activated by either the successful extinction or the relapse of fear. During the retrieval of fear extinction memory, the dominant input to active neurons in the PL was from the vHIP, whereas the retrieval of fear memory, regardless of the age of a memory and testing context, was associated with greater BL input. Optogenetic stimulation of the vHIP&ndash;PL pathway after one session of fear extinction increased conditioned fear, whereas stimulation of the vHIP inputs after several sessions of extinction decreased the conditioned fear response. This latter effect was, however, transient, as stimulation of this pathway 28 d after extinction increased conditioned fear response again. The results show that repeated fear extinction training gradually changes vHIP&ndash;PL connectivity, making fear suppression possible, whereas in the absence of fear suppression from the vHIP, signals from the BL can play a dominant role, resulting in high levels of fear.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Behavioral therapies of fear are based on extinction learning. As extinction memories fade over time, such therapies produce only a temporary suppression of fear, which constitutes a clinical and societal challenge. In our study, we provide a framework for understating the underlying mechanism by which extinction of fear memories fade by demonstrating the existence of two subpopulations of neurons in the prelimbic cortex associated with low and high levels of fear. Insufficient extinction and exposure to the context in which fear memory was formed promoted high fear neuronal activity in the prelimbic cortex, leading to fear retrieval. Extensive extinction training, on the other hand, boosted low fear neuronal activity and, as a result, extinction memory retrieval. This effect was, however, transient and disappeared with time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Studying Independent Kcna6 Knock-out Mice Reveals Toxicity of Exogenous LacZ to Central Nociceptor Terminals and Differential Effects of Kv1.6 on Acute and Neuropathic Pain Sensation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The potassium channel Kv1.6 has recently been implicated as a major modulatory channel subunit expressed in primary nociceptors. Furthermore, its expression at juxtaparanodes of myelinated primary afferents is induced following traumatic nerve injury as part of an endogenous mechanism to reduce hyperexcitability and pain-related hypersensitivity. In this study, we compared two mouse models of constitutive Kv1.6 knock-out (KO) achieved by different methods: traditional gene trap via homologous recombination and CRISPR-mediated excision. Both Kv1.6 KO mouse lines exhibited an unexpected reduction in sensitivity to noxious heat stimuli, to differing extents: the Kv1.6 mice produced via gene trap had a far more significant hyposensitivity. These mice (<I>Kcna6<sup>lacZ</sup></I>) expressed the bacterial reporter enzyme LacZ in place of Kv1.6 as a result of the gene trap mechanism, and we found that their central primary afferent presynaptic terminals developed a striking neurodegenerative phenotype involving accumulation of lipid species, development of "meganeurites," and impaired transmission to dorsal horn wide dynamic range neurons. The anatomic defects were absent in CRISPR-mediated Kv1.6 KO mice (<I>Kcna6</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) but were present in a third mouse model expressing exogenous LacZ in nociceptors under the control of a Nav1.8-promoted Cre recombinase. LacZ reporter enzymes are thus intrinsically neurotoxic to sensory neurons and may induce pathologic defects in transgenic mice, which has confounding implications for the interpretation of gene KOs using <I>lacZ</I>. Nonetheless, in <I>Kcna6</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice not affected by LacZ, we demonstrated a significant role for Kv1.6 regulating acute noxious thermal sensitivity, and both mechanical and thermal pain-related hypersensitivity after nerve injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In recent decades, the expansion of technologies to experimentally manipulate the rodent genome has contributed significantly to the field of neuroscience. While introduction of enzymatic or fluorescent reporter proteins to label neuronal populations is now commonplace, often potential toxicity effects are not fully considered. We show a role of Kv1.6 in acute and neuropathic pain states through analysis of two mouse models lacking Kv1.6 potassium channels: one with additional expression of LacZ and one without. We show that LacZ reporter enzymes induce unintended defects in sensory neurons, with an impact on behavioral data outcomes. To summarize we highlight the importance of Kv1.6 in recovery of normal sensory function following nerve injury, and careful interpretation of data from LacZ reporter models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Stable Population Code for Attention in Prefrontal Cortex Leads a Dynamic Attention Code in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Attention often requires maintaining a stable mental state over time while simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. These requirements place conflicting demands on neural populations, as sensitivity implies a robust response to perturbation by incoming stimuli, which is antithetical to stability. Functional specialization of cortical areas provides one potential mechanism to resolve this conflict. We reasoned that attention signals in executive control areas might be highly stable over time, reflecting maintenance of the cognitive state, thereby freeing up sensory areas to be more sensitive to sensory input (i.e., unstable), which would be reflected by more dynamic attention signals in those areas. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded neural populations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortical area V4 in rhesus macaque monkeys performing an endogenous spatial selective attention task. Using a decoding approach, we found that the neural code for attention states in PFC was substantially more stable over time compared with the attention code in V4 on a moment-by-moment basis, in line with our guiding thesis. Moreover, attention signals in PFC predicted the future attention state of V4 better than vice versa, consistent with a top-down role for PFC in attention. These results suggest a functional specialization of attention mechanisms across cortical areas with a division of labor. PFC signals the cognitive state and maintains this state stably over time, whereas V4 responds to sensory input in a manner dynamically modulated by that cognitive state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention requires maintaining a stable mental state while simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. We hypothesized that these two demands (stability and sensitivity) are distributed between prefrontal and visual cortical areas, respectively. Specifically, we predicted attention signals in visual cortex would be less stable than in prefrontal cortex, and furthermore prefrontal cortical signals would predict attention signals in visual cortex in line with the hypothesized role of prefrontal cortex in top-down executive control. Our results are consistent with suggestions deriving from previous work using separate recordings in the two brain areas in different animals performing different tasks and represent the first direct evidence in support of this hypothesis with simultaneous multiarea recordings within individual animals.</p>

                <p>Sex steroid hormones act on hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons to regulate reproductive neural circuits in the brain. Kisspeptin neurons start to express estrogen receptors <I>in utero</I>, suggesting steroid hormone action on these cells early during development. Whether neurosteroids are locally produced in the embryonic brain and impinge onto kisspeptin/reproductive neural circuitry is not known. To address this question, we analyzed aromatase expression, a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis, in male and female mouse embryos. We identified an aromatase neuronal network comprising ~6000 neurons in the hypothalamus and amygdala. By birth, this network has become sexually dimorphic in a cluster of aromatase neurons in the arcuate nucleus adjacent to kisspeptin neurons. We demonstrate that male arcuate aromatase neurons convert testosterone to estrogen to regulate kisspeptin neuron activity. We provide spatiotemporal information on aromatase neuronal network development and highlight a novel mechanism whereby aromatase neurons regulate the activity of distinct neuronal populations expressing estrogen receptors.</p>
