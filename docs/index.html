              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09080">Stability Control of Metastable States as a Unified Mechanism for Flexible Temporal Modulation in Cognitive Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible modulation of temporal dynamics in neural sequences underlies many cognitive processes. For instance, we can adaptively change the speed of motor sequences and speech. While such flexibility is influenced by various factors such as attention and context, the common neural mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain poorly understood. We developed a biologically plausible neural network model that incorporates neurons with multiple timescales and Hebbian learning rules. This model is capable of generating simple sequential patterns as well as performing delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks that require the retention of stimulus identity. Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands.

                arXiv:2504.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review synthesizes advances in predictive processing within the sensory cortex. Predictive processing theorizes that the brain continuously predicts sensory inputs, refining neuronal responses by highlighting prediction errors. We identify key computational primitives, such as stimulus adaptation, dendritic computation, excitatory/inhibitory balance and hierarchical processing, as central to this framework. Our review highlights convergences, such as top-down inputs and inhibitory interneurons shaping mismatch signals, and divergences, including species-specific hierarchies and modality-dependent layer roles. To address these conflicts, we propose experiments in mice and primates using in-vivo two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings to test whether temporal, motor, and omission mismatch stimuli engage shared or distinct mechanisms. The resulting dataset, collected and shared via the OpenScope program, will enable model validation and community analysis, fostering iterative refinement and refutability to decode the neural circuits of predictive processing.

                arXiv:2504.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing evidence suggests that neural responses to errors were exaggerated in individuals at risk of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon has led to the possibility that the error-related negativity (ERN), a well-known neural correlate of error monitoring could be used as a diagnostic tool for several psychological disorders. However, conflicting evidence between psychopathology and the ERN suggests that this phenomenon is modulated by variables are yet to be identified. Socioeconomic status (SES) could potentially play a role in the relationship between the ERN and psychopathological disorders, given that SES is known to be associated with depression and anxiety. In the current study, we first tested whether SES was related to ERN amplitude. Second, we examined whether the relationship between the ERN and depression was explained by differences in SES. We measured error-related negativity (ERN) from a sample of adult participants from low to high socioeconomic backgrounds while controlling their depression scores. Results show that SES correlated with variations in ERN amplitude. Specifically, we found that low-SES individuals had a larger ERN than wealthier individuals. In addition, the relationship between depression and the ERN was fully accounted for by variations in SES. Overall, our results indicate that SES predicts neural responses to errors. Findings also indicate that the link between depression and ERN may be the result of SES variations. Future research examining the links between psychopathology and error monitoring should control SES differences, and caution is needed if they are to be used as a diagnostic tool in low-income communities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10028">Sequence models for by-trial decoding of cognitive strategies from neural data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the sequence of cognitive operations that underlie decision-making is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Traditional approaches often rely on group-level statistics, which obscure trial-by-trial variations in cognitive strategies. In this study, we introduce a novel machine learning method that combines Hidden Multivariate Pattern analysis with a Structured State Space Sequence model to decode cognitive strategies from electroencephalography data at the trial level. We apply this method to a decision-making task, where participants were instructed to prioritize either speed or accuracy in their responses. Our results reveal an additional cognitive operation, labeled Confirmation, which seems to occur predominantly in the accuracy condition but also frequently in the speed condition. The modeled probability that this operation occurs is associated with higher probability of responding correctly as well as changes of mind, as indexed by electromyography data. By successfully modeling cognitive operations at the trial level, we provide empirical evidence for dynamic variability in decision strategies, challenging the assumption of homogeneous cognitive processes within experimental conditions. Our approach shows the potential of sequence modeling in cognitive neuroscience to capture trial-level variability that is obscured by aggregate analyses. The introduced method offers a new way to detect and understand cognitive strategies in a data-driven manner, with implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in many fields.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10300">Measuring amount of computation done by C.elegans using whole brain neural activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems found in biology, ranging from genetic circuits to the human brain to human social systems, are inherently computational. Although extensive research has explored their resulting functions and behaviors, the underlying computations often remain elusive. Even the fundamental task of quantifying the \textit{amount} of computation performed by a dynamical system remains under-investigated. In this study we address this challenge by introducing a novel framework to estimate the amount of computation implemented by an arbitrary physical system based on empirical time-series of its dynamics. This framework works by forming a statistical reconstruction of that dynamics, and then defining the amount of computation in terms of both the complexity and fidelity of this reconstruction. We validate our framework by showing that it appropriately distinguishes the relative amount of computation across different regimes of Lorenz dynamics and various computation classes of cellular automata. We then apply this framework to neural activity in \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, as captured by calcium imaging. By analyzing time-series neural data obtained from the fluorescent intensity of the calcium indicator GCaMP, we find that high and low amounts of computation are required, respectively, in the neural dynamics of freely moving and immobile worms. Our analysis further sheds light on the amount of computation performed when the system is in various locomotion states. In sum, our study refines the definition of computational amount from time-series data and highlights neural computation in a simple organism across distinct behavioral states.

                arXiv:2504.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been discovered before (arXiv:2306.07676) that for the selectivity gain due to fluctuations in the process of primary odor reception by olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) there exists an optimal concentration of odors at which increased selectivity is mostly manifested. We estimate by means of numerical simulation what could be the gain value at that concentration by modeling ORN as a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with membrane populated by receptor proteins R which bind and release odor molecules randomly. Each R is modeled as a ligand-gated ion channel, and binding-releasing is modeled as a Markov stochastic process. Possible values for the selectivity gain are calculated for ORN parameters suggested by experimental data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10140">The topology of synergy: linking topological and information-theoretic approaches to higher-order interactions in complex systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures." We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.

                arXiv:2406.15665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.

                arXiv:2408.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal neuroimaging modeling has becomes a widely used approach but confronts considerable challenges due to heterogeneity, which encompasses variability in data types, scales, and formats across modalities. This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.

Abstract: Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of areas across visual cortex. Through RNC we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based on cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.

Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.

                arXiv:2504.08201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.

                arXiv:2402.14701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical predictor of psychotherapy success. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze session transcripts and map them to distributed representations. These representations capture the semantic similarities between the dialogues and psychometric instruments, such as the Working Alliance Inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions spanning diverse psychiatric conditions -- including anxiety (N=498), depression (N=377), schizophrenia (N=71), and suicidal tendencies (N=12) -- collected between 1970 and 2012, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories, offering interpretable insights for clinical practice, and identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and how these topics evolve during each turn of the conversation. This integrated framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enables timely feedback for therapists on the quality of therapeutic relationships, and provides clear, actionable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.

                arXiv:2409.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important elements and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is fundamental in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. We show that these irregular dynamics can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals for selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose a free-viewing paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. Superimposing ensures that the relative differences in the neural responses are not driven by differences in object locations. A stimulus-informed decoder is trained to extract EEG components correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and can detect the attended object in unseen data with significantly above-chance accuracy. This shows that the EEG responses to naturalistic motion are modulated by selective attention. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap with the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG may also capture neural responses to unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design.

Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, defined by its ubiquitous yet irreplaceable role in human activities ranging from routine tasks to civil engineering. Embedding machines with mechanical reasoning is therefore an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, we leveraged 155 cognitive experiments to test the understanding of system stability, gears and pulley systems, leverage principle, inertia and motion, and fluid mechanics in 26 Vision Language Models (VLMs). Results indicate that VLMs consistently perform worse than humans on all domains, while demonstrate significant difficulty in reasoning about gear systems and fluid mechanics. Notably, their performance on these tasks do not improve as number of parameters increase, suggesting that current attention-based architecture may fail to grasp certain underlying mechanisms required for mechanical reasoning, particularly those pertaining to mental simulations.

                arXiv:2410.00332v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding law of conservation is a critical milestone in human cognitive development considered to be supported by the apprehension of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we have curated the ConserveBench, a battery of 365 cognitive experiments across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve transformational tasks which require reversibility understanding. The latter two involve non-transformational tasks which assess quantity understanding. Surprisingly, we find that while Vision Language Models are generally good at transformational tasks, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks. There is a dissociation between understanding the reversibility of operations and understanding the concept of quantity, which both are believed to be the cornerstones of understanding law of conservation in humans. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/}{Website}$

                arXiv:2412.07236v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.

                arXiv:2405.14139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) has been pivotal in advancing machine learning and remains essential in computational applications and comparative studies of biological and artificial neural networks. Despite its widespread use, the implementation of BP in the brain remains elusive, and its biological plausibility is often questioned due to inherent issues such as the need for symmetry of weights between forward and backward connections, and the requirement of distinct forward and backward phases of computation. Here, we introduce a novel neuroplasticity rule that offers a potential mechanism for implementing BP in the brain. Similar in general form to the classical Hebbian rule, this rule is based on the core principles of maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as on retrograde signaling, and operates over three progressively slower timescales: neural firing, retrograde signaling, and neural plasticity. We hypothesize that each neuron possesses an internal state, termed credit, in addition to its firing rate. After achieving equilibrium in firing rates, neurons receive credits based on their contribution to the E-I balance of postsynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling. As the network's credit distribution stabilizes, connections from those presynaptic neurons are strengthened that significantly contribute to the balance of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate mathematically that our learning rule precisely replicates BP in layered neural networks without any approximations. Simulations on artificial neural networks reveal that this rule induces varying community structures in networks, depending on the learning rate. This simple theoretical framework presents a biologically plausible implementation of BP, with testable assumptions and predictions that may be evaluated through biological experiments.

                arXiv:2504.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems often require domain-specific expertise to design problem-dependent methodologies. Recently, several approaches have gained attention by integrating large language models (LLMs) into genetic algorithms. Building on this trend, we introduce Language Model Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO), a novel method that incorporates an LLM into the swarm intelligence framework of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In LMPSO, the velocity of each particle is represented as a prompt that generates the next candidate solution, leveraging the capabilities of an LLM to produce solutions in accordance with the PSO paradigm. This integration enables an LLM-driven search process that adheres to the foundational principles of PSO. The proposed LMPSO approach is evaluated across multiple problem domains, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), heuristic improvement for TSP, and symbolic regression. These problems are traditionally challenging for standard PSO due to the structured nature of their solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that LMPSO is particularly effective for solving problems where solutions are represented as structured sequences, such as mathematical expressions or programmatic constructs. By incorporating LLMs into the PSO framework, LMPSO establishes a new direction in swarm intelligence research. This method not only broadens the applicability of PSO to previously intractable problems but also showcases the potential of LLMs in addressing complex optimization challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09796">Advancing RFI-Detection in Radio Astronomy with Liquid State Machines</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from anthropogenic radio sources poses significant challenges to current and future radio telescopes. Contemporary approaches to detecting RFI treat the task as a semantic segmentation problem on radio telescope spectrograms. Typically, complex heuristic algorithms handle this task of `flagging' in combination with manual labeling (in the most difficult cases). While recent machine-learning approaches have demonstrated high accuracy, they often fail to meet the stringent operational requirements of modern radio observatories. Owing to their inherently time-varying nature, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative method to RFI-detection by utilizing the time-varying nature of the spectrographic source data. In this work, we apply Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a class of spiking neural networks, to RFI-detection. We employ second-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LiF) neurons, marking the first use of this architecture and neuron type for RFI-detection. We test three encoding methods and three increasingly complex readout layers, including a transformer decoder head, providing a hybrid of SNN and ANN techniques. Our methods extend LSMs beyond conventional classification tasks to fine-grained spatio-temporal segmentation. We train LSMs on simulated data derived from the Hyrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a known benchmark for RFI-detection. Our model achieves a per-pixel accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 0.743, demonstrating competitive performance on this highly challenging task. This work expands the sophistication of SNN techniques and architectures applied to RFI-detection, and highlights the effectiveness of LSMs in handling fine-grained, complex, spatio-temporal signal-processing tasks.

Abstract: Over the years, genetic programming (GP) has evolved, with many proposed variations, especially in how they represent a solution. Being essentially a program synthesis algorithm, it is capable of tackling multiple problem domains. Current benchmarking initiatives are fragmented, as the different representations are not compared with each other and their performance is not measured across the different domains. In this work, we propose a unified framework, dubbed TinyverseGP (inspired by tinyGP), which provides support to multiple representations and problem domains, including symbolic regression, logic synthesis and policy search.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.

                arXiv:2504.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing power of generative models raises major concerns about the authenticity of published content. To address this problem, several synthetic content detection methods have been proposed for uniformly structured media such as image or text. However, little work has been done on the detection of synthetic tabular data, despite its importance in industry and government. This form of data is complex to handle due to the diversity of its structures: the number and types of the columns may vary wildly from one table to another. We tackle the tough problem of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'', i.e. when the model is deployed on table structures it has never seen before. We introduce a novel datum-wise transformer architecture and show that it outperforms existing models. Furthermore, we investigate the application of domain adaptation techniques to enhance the effectiveness of our model, thereby providing a more robust data-forgery detection solution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08842">Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.
  We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.
  Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.

                arXiv:2504.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.

Abstract: The successes of intelligent systems have quite relied on the artificial learning of information, which lead to the broad applications of neural learning solutions. As a common sense, the training of neural networks can be largely improved by specifically defined initialization, neuron layers as well as the activation functions. Though there are sequential layer based initialization available, the generalized solution to initial stages is still desired. In this work, an improved approach to initialization of neural learning is presented, which adopts the shrinkage approach to initialize the transformation of each layer of networks. It can be universally adapted for the structures of any networks with random layers, while stable performance can be attained. Furthermore, the smooth learning of networks is adopted in this work, due to the diverse influence on neural learning. Experimental results on several artificial data sets demonstrate that, the proposed method is able to present robust results with the shrinkage initialization, and competent for smooth learning of neural networks.

Abstract: Decoding brain signals accurately and efficiently is crucial for intra-cortical brain-computer interfaces. Traditional decoding approaches based on neural activity vector features suffer from low accuracy, whereas deep learning based approaches have high computational cost. To improve both the decoding accuracy and efficiency, this paper proposes a spiking neural network (SNN) for effective and energy-efficient intra-cortical brain signal decoding. We also propose a feature fusion approach, which integrates the manually extracted neural activity vector features with those extracted by a deep neural network, to further improve the decoding accuracy. Experiments in decoding motor-related intra-cortical brain signals of two rhesus macaques demonstrated that our SNN model achieved higher accuracy than traditional artificial neural networks; more importantly, it was tens or hundreds of times more efficient. The SNN model is very suitable for high precision and low power applications like intra-cortical brain-computer interfaces.

Our experiments show that ViT-LCA achieves higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset while consuming significantly less energy than other spiking vision transformer counterparts. Furthermore, ViT-LCA's neuromorphic-friendly design allows for more direct mapping onto current neuromorphic architectures.

                arXiv:2501.16159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Production Scheduling, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) aims to optimize a sequence of operations and assign each to an eligible machine with varying processing times. For integration of the workforce, each machine also requires a worker to be present to process an operation which additionally affects the processing times. The resulting problem is called Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-W). The FJSSP has been approached with various problem representations, including Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Constrained Programming (CP), and Simulation-based Optimization (SBO). In the latter area in particular, there exists a large number of specialized Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Yet, the solvers are often developed for single use cases only, and validated on a few selected test instances, let alone compared with results from solvers using other problem representations. While suitable approaches do also exist, the design of the FJSSP-W instances is not standardized and the algorithms are hardly comparable. This calls for a systematic benchmarking environment that provides a comprehensive set of FJSSP(-W) instances and supports targeted algorithm development. It will facilitate the comparison of algorithmic performance in the face of different problem characteristics. The present paper presents a collection of 402 commonly accepted FJSSP instances and proposes an approach to extend these with worker flexibility. In addition, we present a detailed procedure for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms on these problem sets and provide suitable model representations for this purpose. We provide complexity characteristics for all presented instances as well as baseline results of common commercial solvers to facilitate the validation of new algorithmic developments.

                arXiv:2503.20286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

                arXiv:2504.01332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an archive to store nondominated solutions found during the search of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is a useful practice. However, as nondominated solutions of a multi-objective optimisation problem can be enormous or infinitely many, it is desirable to provide the decision-maker with only a small, representative portion of all the nondominated solutions in the archive, thus entailing a truncation operation. Then, an important issue is when to truncate the archive. This can be done once a new solution generated, a batch of new solutions generated, or even using an unbounded archive to keep all nondominated solutions generated and truncate it later. Intuitively, the last approach may lead to a better result since we have all the information in hand before performing the truncation. In this paper, we study this issue and investigate the effect of the timing of truncating the archive. We apply well-established truncation criteria that are commonly used in the population maintenance procedure of MOEAs (e.g., crowding distance, hypervolume indicator, and decomposition). We show that, interestingly, truncating the archive once a new solution generated tends to be the best, whereas considering an unbounded archive is often the worst. We analyse and discuss this phenomenon. Our results highlight the importance of developing effective subset selection techniques (rather than employing the population maintenance methods in MOEAs) when using a large archive.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07884">CatCMA with Margin: Stochastic Optimization for Continuous, Integer, and Categorical Variables</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.07884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO), addressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world MV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables, requiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently, stochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in mixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot handle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose CatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that jointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is developed by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a mixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer handling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and following the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer problems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence performance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM effectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply incorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.

                arXiv:2407.19566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has recently gained momentum with the emergence of various neuromorphic processors. As the field advances, there is an increasing focus on developing training methods that can effectively leverage the unique properties of spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs emulate the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, making them particularly well-suited for real-time, event-driven processing. To fully harness the potential of SNNs across different neuromorphic platforms, effective training methodologies are essential. In SNNs, learning rules are based on neurons' spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's spiking threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. This work focuses on the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a trainable parameter effectively addresses the issue of dead neurons during training. This leads to a more robust training algorithm, resulting in improved convergence, increased test accuracy, and a substantial reduction in the number of training epochs required to achieve viable accuracy on spatiotemporal datasets such as NMNIST, DVS128, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), with up to 30% training speed-up and up to 2% higher accuracy on these datasets.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) decomposes complex reaching tasks into a sequence of simple subgoal-conditioned tasks, showing significant promise for addressing long-horizon planning in large-scale environments. This paper bridges the goal-conditioned HRL based on graph-based planning to brain mechanisms, proposing a hippocampus-striatum-like dual-controller hypothesis. Inspired by the brain mechanisms of organisms (i.e., the high-reward preferences observed in hippocampal replay) and instance-based theory, we propose a high-return sampling strategy for constructing memory graphs, improving sample efficiency. Additionally, we derive a model-free lower-level Q-function gradient penalty to resolve the model dependency issues present in prior work, improving the generalization of Lipschitz constraints in applications. Finally, we integrate these two extensions, High-reward Graph and model-free Gradient Penalty (HG2P), into the state-of-the-art framework ACLG, proposing a novel goal-conditioned HRL framework, HG2P+ACLG. Experimentally, the results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art goal-conditioned HRL algorithms on a variety of long-horizon navigation tasks and robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In 'red' mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/J-Rosser-UK/AgentBreeder.

                arXiv:2504.05108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.

                arXiv:2504.06006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning. Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91150">UFMTrack, an Under-Flow Migration Tracker enabling analysis of the entire multi-step immune cell extravasation cascade across the blood-brain barrier in microfluidic devices</a></h4>

              
                The endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly controls immune cell trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS). In neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, this tight control is, however, disturbed, leading to immune cell infiltration into the CNS. The development of in vitro models of the BBB combined with microfluidic devices has advanced our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the multistep T-cell extravasation across the BBB. A major bottleneck of these in vitro studies is the absence of a robust and automated pipeline suitable for analyzing and quantifying the sequential interaction steps of different immune cell subsets with the BBB under physiological flow in vitro. Here, we present the under-flow migration tracker (<sup>UFM</sup>Track) framework for studying immune cell interactions with endothelial monolayers under physiological flow. We then showcase a pipeline built based on it to study the entire multistep extravasation cascade of immune cells across brain microvascular endothelial cells under physiological flow in vitro. <sup>UFM</sup>Track achieves 90% track reconstruction efficiency and allows for scaling due to the reduction of the analysis cost and by eliminating experimenter bias. This allowed for an in-depth analysis of all behavioral regimes involved in the multistep immune cell extravasation cascade. The study summarizes how <sup>UFM</sup>Track can be employed to delineate the interactions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the BBB under physiological flow. We also demonstrate its applicability to the other BBB models, showcasing broader applicability of the developed framework to a range of immune cell-endothelial monolayer interaction studies. The <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework along with the generated datasets is publicly available in the corresponding repositories.

                Background Emergency landing procedures during landing gear malfunction necessitate quick thinking and precise execution to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. A common strategy involves executing a "wheels-up" landing. This paper examines a unique emergency landing scenario where an aircraft lands on a mobile platform moving along the runway. This method requires coordination and control between the aircraft and the platform to match their velocities during the landing process. Methods A Boeing 747 was performed as a 3-D point mass simulation in MATLAB. The mobile platform was modeled as a first-order system having throttle as an input and the mobile platform velocity as an output. The methods Proportional integral derivative controller (PID) and sliding mode control (SMC) were utilized to achieve the velocity synchronization amid the aircraft and the platform. For examining the stability of the mobile platform model, Lyapunov’s Theorem for stability was employed. and sliding mode control (SMC) were utilized to achieve the velocity synchronization amid the aircraft and the platform. For examining the stability of the mobile platform model, Lyapunov’s Theorem for stability was employed. Results Simulation results show that both PID and SMC controllers successfully controlled the platform velocity to match the aircraft velocity during the emergency landing. However, the SMC controller demonstrated superior performance with faster convergence to the desired velocity reference compared to the PID controller. Conclusions The analysis demonstrated that the most suitable control strategy for the mobile platform velocity in relation to aircraft velocity is SMC during emergency landings. The inherent robustness of SMC to disturbances and uncertainties, coupled with its rapid convergence capabilities, makes it well-suited for this application.

                Background Digital payment systems are pivotal in the digital economy, relying on the interplay between internet technology and e-vendors. While the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) have been extensively used to explain technology adoption, the role of trust in financial technology adoption remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by developing an extended Trust-TAM-TPB model, providing a comprehensive framework to analyze digital payment adoption in emerging markets. Methods A quantitative approach was adopted, analyzing survey data from 509 respondents using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The extended model examines both technological factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and trust-related factors (trust’s influence on behavioral intention via subjective norms, attitude, and perceived behavioral control). Results Findings confirm that trust is a significant determinant of digital payment adoption, influencing both perceived usefulness and subjective norms. However, a negative relationship was found between perceived usefulness (PU) and attitude (ATT), suggesting that while users recognize the benefits of digital payments, their attitudes may still be shaped by traditional cash-based habits and security concerns. These insights challenge traditional TAM assumptions and emphasize the importance of trust in driving adoption. Conclusions This study contributes to technology acceptance literature by integrating trust into the TAM-TPB framework and highlighting its dual role in shaping both perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. Practically, the findings suggest that policymakers and financial institutions should prioritize trust-building strategies, including fraud prevention measures, financial literacy programs, and transparent transaction policies, to accelerate digital payment adoption in developing economies. These insights are particularly relevant for Vietnam’s Northern mountainous regions, where digital payment penetration remains low.

                Background The surge of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia has markedly heightened the hospital demand for ICU care. Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibit discernible changes in laboratory results throughout their infection. This study aimed to assess the progression of COVID-19 infection, ICU admission rate, and patient outcomes by analyzing the profile of laboratory parameters in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective cohort involved six hospitals in Jakarta. The inclusion criteria consisted of PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients who underwent laboratory examinations for hematology, hemostasis, clinical chemistry, and infection markers during the pandemic from 2020 to 2021. Results Total of 1865 COVID-19 patients participated in this study, with the majority of 54.16% male patients. Of these patients, 24.23% required ICU care, and 46.23% were aged >60 years old. The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was 21.87%, with 58.68% of male patients, and 54.9% aged >60 years. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lung diseases, and liver diseases, which aggravate the severity of COVID-19 infection and increase the mortality rate, were observed (p<0.05). The median values of leukocytes, neutrophils, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), prolonged prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased significantly. Conversely, median glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and lymphocyte values declined with the progression of COVID-19 infection, ICU admission, and non-survival patient outcomes (p< 0.001). Conclusions Patients aged >60 years, with length of stay exceeding 8 days, low Hemoglobin levels, high NLR, low platelet levels, prolonged PT, high D-dimer, high CRP, and elevated IL-6 were correlated with severe COVID-19 infection, ICU admission, and unfavorable patient outcomes. The values of leukocyte count, neutrophil%, NLR, PT, D-dimer, AST, LDH, urea, creatinine, CRP, PCT, and IL-6 increased, while eGFR and lymphocytes decreased in severe COVID-19 infection, ICU admission, and non-survival patient outcome evaluations.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Vasco Coelho</p>

As the availability of big biomedical data advances, there is a growing need of university students trained professionally on analyzing these data and correctly interpreting their results. We propose here a study plan for a master’s degree course on biomedical data science, by describing our experience during the last academic year. In our university course, we explained how to find an open biomedical dataset, how to correctly clean it and how to prepare it for a computational statistics or machine learning phase. By doing so, we introduce common health data science terms and explained how to avoid common mistakes in the process. Moreover, we clarified how to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how to reasonably interpret its results. We also described how to properly execute a supervised or unsupervised machine learning analysis, and now to understand and interpret its outcomes. Eventually, we explained how to validate the findings obtained. We illustrated all these steps in the context of open science principles, by suggesting to the students to use only open source programming languages (R or Python in particular), open biomedical data (if available), and open access scientific articles (if possible). We believe our teaching proposal can be useful and of interest for anyone wanting to start to prepare a course on biomedical data science.

                <p>by Nava Leibovich, Sidhartha Goyal</p>

Tracking cellular lineages using genetic barcodes provides insights across biology and has become an important tool. However, barcoding strategies remain ad hoc. We show that elevating barcode insertion probability and thus increasing the average number of barcodes within the cells, adds to the number of traceable lineages but may decrease the accuracy of lineages inference due to reading errors. We establish the trade-off between accuracy in tracing lineages and the total number of traceable lineages, and find optimal experimental parameters under limited resources concerning the populations size of tracked cells and barcode pool complexity.

                <p>by Caesar Tawfeeq, Jiyao Wang, Umesh Khaniya, Thomas Madej, James Song, Ravinder Abrol, Philippe Youkharibache</p>

The Immunoglobulin fold (Ig-fold) is found in proteins from all domains of life and represents the most populous fold in the human genome, with current estimates ranging from 2 to 3% of protein coding regions. That proportion is much higher in the surfaceome where Ig and Ig-like domains orchestrate cell-cell recognition, adhesion and signaling. The ability of Ig-domains to reliably fold and self-assemble through highly specific interfaces represents a remarkable property of these domains, making them key elements of molecular interaction systems: the immune system, the nervous system, the vascular system and the muscular system. We define a universal residue numbering scheme, common to all domains sharing the Ig-fold in order to study the wide spectrum of Ig-domain variants constituting the Ig-proteome and Ig-Ig interactomes at the heart of these <i>systems</i>. The “IgStrand numbering scheme” enables the identification of Ig structural proteomes and interactomes in and between any species, and comparative structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses. We review how Ig-domains are classified today as topological and structural variants and highlight the <i>“Ig-fold irreducible structural signature”</i> shared by all of them. The IgStrand numbering scheme lays the foundation for the systematic annotation of structural proteomes by detecting and accurately labeling Ig-, Ig-like and Ig-extended domains in proteins, which are poorly annotated in current databases and opens the door to accurate machine learning. Importantly, it sheds light on the robust <i>Ig protein folding algorithm</i> used by nature to form beta sandwich supersecondary structures. The numbering scheme powers an algorithm implemented in the interactive structural analysis software iCn3D to systematically recognize Ig-domains, annotate them and perform detailed analyses comparing any domain sharing the Ig-fold in sequence, topology and structure, regardless of their diverse topologies or origin. The scheme provides a robust fold detection and labeling mechanism that reveals unsuspected structural homologies among protein structures beyond currently identified Ig- and Ig-like domain variants. Indeed, multiple folds classified independently contain a common structural signature, in particular jelly-rolls. Examples of folds that harbor an “Ig-extended” architecture are given. Applications in protein engineering around the Ig-architecture are straightforward based on the universal numbering.

                <p>by Torbjørn V. Ness, Tom Tetzlaff, Gaute T. Einevoll, David Dahmen</p>

Neural activity at the population level is commonly studied experimentally through measurements of electric brain signals like local field potentials (LFPs), or electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To allow for comparison between observed and simulated neural activity it is therefore important that simulations of neural activity can accurately predict these brain signals. Simulations of neural activity at the population level often rely on point-neuron network models or firing-rate models. While these simplified representations of neural activity are computationally efficient, they lack the explicit spatial information needed for calculating LFP/EEG signals. Different heuristic approaches have been suggested for overcoming this limitation, but the accuracy of these approaches has not fully been assessed. One such heuristic approach, the so-called kernel method, has previously been applied with promising results and has the additional advantage of being well-grounded in the biophysics underlying electric brain signal generation. It is based on calculating rate-to-LFP/EEG kernels for each synaptic pathway in a network model, after which LFP/EEG signals can be obtained directly from population firing rates. This amounts to a massive reduction in the computational effort of calculating brain signals because the brain signals are calculated for each population instead of for each neuron. Here, we investigate how and when the kernel method can be expected to work, and present a theoretical framework for predicting its accuracy. We show that the relative error of the brain signal predictions is a function of the single-cell kernel heterogeneity and the spike-train correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that the kernel method is most accurate for contributions which are also dominating the brain signals: spatially clustered and correlated synaptic input to large populations of pyramidal cells. We thereby further establish the kernel method as a promising approach for calculating electric brain signals from large-scale neural simulations.

A central challenge in the progression of a variety of open questions in biology, such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior. Information-theoretic approaches provide a quantitative framework for extracting patterns from data, but so far have been predominantly applied to neuronal systems at the tissue-level. Here, we demonstrate how time series of Ca2<sup>+</sup> dynamics can be used to identify the structure and information dynamics of other biological tissues. To this end, we expressed the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in an organoid system of explanted amphibian epidermis derived from the African clawed frog <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, and imaged calcium activity pre- and post- a puncture injury, for six replicate organoids. We constructed functional connectivity networks by computing mutual information between cells from time series derived using medical imaging techniques to track intracellular Ca2<sup>+</sup>. We analyzed network properties including degree distribution, spatial embedding, and modular structure. We find organoid networks exhibit potential evidence for more connectivity than null models, with our models displaying high degree hubs and mesoscale community structure with spatial clustering. Utilizing functional connectivity networks, our model suggests the tissue retains non-random features after injury, displays long range correlations and structure, and non-trivial clustering that is not necessarily spatially dependent. In the context of this reconstruction method our results suggest increased integration after injury, possible cellular coordination in response to injury, and some type of generative structure of the anatomy. While we study Ca2<sup>+</sup> in <i>Xenopus</i> epidermal cells, our computational approach and analyses highlight how methods developed to analyze functional connectivity in neuronal tissues can be generalized to any tissue and fluorescent signal type. We discuss expanded methods of analyses to improve models of non-neuronal information processing highlighting the potential of our framework to provide a bridge between neuroscience and more basal modes of information processing.

Multiple -omics (genomics, proteomics, etc.) profiles are commonly generated to gain insight into a disease or physiological system. Constructing multi-omics networks with respect to the trait(s) of interest provides an opportunity to understand relationships between molecular features but integration is challenging due to multiple data sets with high dimensionality. One approach is to use canonical correlation to integrate one or two omics types and a single trait of interest. However, these types of methods may be limited due to (1) not accounting for higher-order correlations existing among features, (2) computational inefficiency when extending to more than two omics data when using a penalty term-based sparsity method, and (3) lack of flexibility for focusing on specific correlations (e.g., omics-to-phenotype correlation versus omics-to-omics correlations). In this work, we have developed a novel multi-omics network analysis pipeline called Sparse Generalized Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis Network Inference (SGTCCA-Net) that can effectively overcome these limitations. We also introduce an implementation to improve the summarization of networks for downstream analyses. Simulation and real-data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method for inferring omics networks and features of interest.

Insulin and other growth factors are key regulators of liver gene expression, including in metabolic diseases. Most of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity induced by insulin is considered to be dependent on PI3Kα. We used mice lacking p110α, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, to investigate its role in the regulation of liver gene expression in health and in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The absence of hepatocyte PI3Kα reduced maximal insulin-induced PI3K activity and signaling, promoted glucose intolerance in lean mice and significantly regulated liver gene expression, including insulin-sensitive genes, in <i>ad libitum</i> feeding. Some of the defective regulation of gene expression in response to hepatocyte-restricted insulin receptor deletion was related to PI3Kα signaling. In addition, though PI3Kα deletion in hepatocytes promoted insulin resistance, it was protective against steatotic liver disease in diet-induced obesity. In the absence of hepatocyte PI3Kα, the effect of diet-induced obesity on liver gene expression was significantly altered, with changes in rhythmic gene expression in liver. Altogether, this study highlights the specific role of p110α in the control of liver gene expression in physiology and in the metabolic rewiring that occurs during MASLD.

                Background Background Case reports are one of the important forms of documentation and publication of clinical physiotherapy presenting the first line of evidence in scientific literature. In order to provide a systematic and precise structure for reporting and presenting cases, the CAse REport (CARE) guidelines were established in 2013. However, these guidelines present limitations as reporting requires items of specific specialties following the checklist. Authors from different specialities have developed CARE extensions specifying the characteristic features of corresponding fields, however, an extension dealing with physiotherapy assessment and line of management in the CARE guidelines is proposed as Physiotherapy CAse REport (PhyCARE). Method A survey will be conducted using standard e-Delphi methodology using Google forms®. 1 , 3 , 5 The e-Delphi questionnaire shall comprise responses on the relevance of each item of the CARE 2013 guideline with respect to physiotherapy. This shall be followed by suggestions from e-Delphi members regarding the incorporation of new items or adaptations of the existing items in the CARE 2013 statement using controlled feedback. Accordingly, based on the responses and suggestions from the e-Delphi experts, the core committee will draft the initial version of the PhyCARE checklist, which will be included in the second round of the e-Delphi process. Administration of the questionnaire as well as the sequential rounds shall continue unless a comprehensive set of findings with concurred definitions are obtained. Due to the fact that there is no requirement set for the number of e-Delphi rounds, the entire procedure will be carried out online. Subsequently, followed by pilot testing, submission of the CARE extension for physiotherapy (PhyCARE) will be conducted for publication and dissemination. The 2010 “Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting” and instructions from the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network will be followed in the preparation of PhyCARE guidelines. The guidelines will be propagated on different platforms and journals will be requested to adopt the guidelines. Registration The reporting guideline under development is prospectively registered on the EQUATOR Network website on PhyCaRe – Reporting guideline for physiotherapy case reports.

                Background Haematological disorders characterized by hypocellular marrow like aplastic anaemia (AA) and hypocellular myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS-h) are diagnostic challenges as the clinical and morphological features overlap, while the treatment and prognosis differ. Bone marrow mast cell quantification is proposed as a supplementary diagnostic and prognostic tool to differentiate AA from MDS-h. We aim to study the distribution of mast cells in hypoplastic marrow and determine its role in differential diagnosis of AA and MDS-h. Methods We analysed bone marrow biopsies of 65 cases of hypoplastic/aplastic marrow received during the year 2015-2021 for the distribution of mast cells using Toluidine Blue special staining. Hematopoietic stem cells were assessed with the help of CD34 immunohistochemistry. Results Increased mast cells were noted in 55.4% of all the cases, of which 48% were cases of AA and 21% were cases of MDS-h (P: 0.04). Overall, 76% of AA and 33% of MDS-h cases showed increased numbers of mast cells. Reduced hematopoietic stem cells were noted in 69.4% of the cases with elevated mast cells (P: 0.1). Conclusions Mast cell quantification in trephine biopsy of AA and MDS-h can act as a supplementary diagnostic tool and guide the management of the respective entities.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years, with an age range of 17–45 years. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Phillips et al. demonstrate how neural representations of abstract rules governing behavior emerge. The thalamus identifies the relevant rule from converging, weak cortical inputs of different task variables, and then it amplifies and sustains the rule representation in prefrontal cortex. The thalamus and prefrontal cortex together monitor the outcome of rule-guided behavior.

                Sleep is crucial for memory formation. Deng et al. find that cAMP levels in mice oscillate with a 1-min cycle during slow-wave sleep, and hippocampal activity at the peak of these oscillations is necessary for memory consolidation.

                Liu et al. report that ILC2s infiltrate the subventricular zone at the recovery stage following cerebral ischemia and facilitate neurorepair by producing Areg to expand NSPCs. These findings suggest that ILC2s and their products may provide promising therapeutic opportunities for neurorepair following brain injury.

                The monocyte-to-macrophage transition in metastasized lungs is not fully understood. Jeong et al. show that MHC class II+ macrophage differentiation is impaired in metastasized lungs, accompanied by PGE2-EP2-driven DNA hypermethylation of genes associated with non-neoplastic myeloid cells. Deletion of the PGE2 receptor EP2 promoted MHC class II+ macrophage differentiation and attenuated lung metastasis.

                Repeat-expanded RNAs form foci that sequester RBPs. Ouyang et al. find that most foci in DM1 are composed of single RNAs, which are sufficient for potent sequestration of the RBP MBNL1. The authors show that multimeric foci form from transcriptional bursting and are held together by MBNL proteins.

This challenges the idea that the OFC relies on the hippocampus and suggests that these regions work in parallel to process different aspects of cognitive maps.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97403">Cell cycle and age-related modulations of mouse chromosome stiffness</a></h4>

              
                Chromosome structure is complex, and many aspects of chromosome organization are still not understood. Measuring the stiffness of chromosomes offers valuable insight into their structural properties. In this study, we analyzed the stiffness of chromosomes from metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes. Our results revealed a tenfold increase in stiffness (Young’s modulus) of MI chromosomes compared to somatic chromosomes. Furthermore, the stiffness of MII chromosomes was found to be lower than that of MI chromosomes. We examined the role of meiosis-specific cohesin complexes in regulating chromosome stiffness. Surprisingly, the stiffness of chromosomes from three meiosis-specific cohesin mutants did not significantly differ from that of wild-type chromosomes, indicating that these cohesins may not be primary determinants of chromosome stiffness. Additionally, our findings revealed an age-related increase of chromosome stiffness for MI oocytes. Since aging is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage, we investigated the impact of etoposide-induced DNA damage on chromosome stiffness and found that it led to a reduction in stiffness in MI oocytes. Overall, our study underscores the dynamic and cyclical nature of chromosome stiffness, modulated by both the cell cycle and age-related factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96722">Treacle’s ability to form liquid-like phase condensates is essential for nucleolar fibrillar center assembly, efficient rRNA transcription and processing, and rRNA gene repair</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the role of the nucleolar protein Treacle in organizing and regulating the nucleolus in human cells. Our results support Treacle’s ability to form liquid-like phase condensates through electrostatic interactions among molecules. The formation of these biomolecular condensates is crucial for segregating nucleolar fibrillar centers from the dense fibrillar component and ensuring high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription and accurate rRNA processing. Both the central and C-terminal domains of Treacle are required to form liquid-like condensates. The initiation of phase separation is attributed to the C-terminal domain. The central domain is characterized by repeated stretches of alternatively charged amino acid residues and is vital for condensate stability. Overexpression of mutant forms of Treacle that cannot form liquid-like phase condensates compromises the assembly of fibrillar centers, suppressing rRNA gene transcription and disrupting rRNA processing. These mutant forms also fail to recruit DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), suppressing the DNA damage response in the nucleolus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102434">Oncogenic and teratogenic effects of Trp53Y217C, an inflammation-prone mouse model of the human hotspot mutant TP53Y220C</a></h4>

              
                Missense ‘hotspot’ mutations localized in six p53 codons account for 20% of <i>TP53</i> mutations in human cancers. Hotspot p53 mutants have lost the tumor suppressive functions of the wildtype protein, but whether and how they may gain additional functions promoting tumorigenesis remain controversial. Here, we generated <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C</sup>, a mouse model of the human hotspot mutant <i>TP53</i><sup>Y220C</sup>. DNA damage responses were lost in <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C/Y217C</sup> (<i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup>) cells, and <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> fibroblasts exhibited increased chromosome instability compared to <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Furthermore, <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> male mice died earlier than <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> males, with more aggressive thymic lymphomas. This correlated with an increased expression of inflammation-related genes in <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> thymic cells compared to <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Surprisingly, we recovered only one <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female for 22 <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> males at weaning, a skewed distribution explained by a high frequency of <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female embryos with exencephaly and the death of most <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female neonates. Strikingly, however, when we treated pregnant females with the anti-inflammatory drug supformin (LCC-12), we observed a fivefold increase in the proportion of viable <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> weaned females in their progeny. Together, these data suggest that the p53<sup>Y217C</sup> mutation not only abrogates wildtype p53 functions but also promotes inflammation, with oncogenic effects in males and teratogenic effects in females.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97144">Enteric glia regulate Paneth cell secretion and intestinal microbial ecology</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) interact closely with the intestinal epithelium and secrete signals that influence epithelial cell proliferation and barrier formation in vitro. Whether these interactions are important in vivo, however, is unclear because previous studies reached conflicting conclusions (Prochera and Rao, 2023). To better define the roles of enteric glia in steady state regulation of the intestinal epithelium, we characterized the glia in closest proximity to epithelial cells and found that the majority express the gene Proteolipid protein 1 (<i>PLP1</i>) in both mice and humans. To test their functions using an unbiased approach, we genetically depleted PLP1<sup>+</sup> cells in mice and transcriptionally profiled the small and large intestines. Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on transcriptional programs and the few identified changes varied along the gastrointestinal tract. In the ileum, where enteric glia had been considered most essential for epithelial integrity, glial depletion did not drastically alter epithelial gene expression but caused a modest enrichment in signatures of Paneth cells, a secretory cell type important for innate immunity. In the absence of PLP1<sup>+</sup> glia, Paneth cell number was intact, but a subset appeared abnormal with irregular and heterogenous cytoplasmic granules, suggesting a secretory deficit. Consistent with this possibility, ileal explants from glial-depleted mice secreted less functional lysozyme than controls with corresponding effects on fecal microbial composition. Collectively, these data suggest that enteric glia do not exert broad effects on the intestinal epithelium but have an essential role in regulating Paneth cell function and gut microbial ecology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100941">Somatodendritic orientation determines tDCS-induced neuromodulation of Purkinje cell activity in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum is a promising non-invasive neuromodulatory technique being proposed for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how externally applied currents affect neuronal spiking activity in cerebellar circuits in vivo. We investigated how Cb-tDCS affects the firing rate of Purkinje cells (PC) and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the polarity-dependent modulation of neuronal activity induced by tDCS. Mice (n=9) were prepared for the chronic recording of local field potentials (LFPs) to assess the actual electric field gradient imposed by Cb-tDCS in our experimental design. Single-neuron extracellular recording of PCs in awake (n=24) and anesthetized (n=27) mice was combined with juxtacellular recordings and subsequent staining of PC with neurobiotin under anesthesia (n=8) to correlate their neuronal orientation with their response to Cb-tDCS. Finally, a high-density Neuropixels recording system was used to demonstrate the relevance of neuronal orientation during the application of Cb-tDCS in awake mice (n=6). In this study, we observe that Cb-tDCS induces a heterogeneous polarity-dependent modulation of the firing rate of PCs and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex. We demonstrate that the apparently heterogeneous effects of tDCS on PC activity can be explained by taking into account the somatodendritic orientation relative to the electric field. Our findings highlight the need to consider neuronal orientation and morphology to improve tDCS computational models, enhance stimulation protocol reliability, and optimize effects in both basic and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102321">Pleiotropy increases parallel selection signatures during adaptation from standing genetic variation</a></h4>

              
                The phenomenon of parallel evolution, whereby similar genomic and phenotypic changes occur across replicated pairs of populations or species, is widely studied. Nevertheless, the determining factors of parallel evolution remain poorly understood. Theoretical studies have proposed that pleiotropy, the influence of a single gene on multiple traits, is an important factor. In order to gain a deeper insight into the role of pleiotropy for parallel evolution from standing genetic variation, we characterized the interplay between parallelism, polymorphism, and pleiotropy. The present study examined the parallel gene expression evolution in 10 replicated populations of <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, which were adapted from standing variation to the same new temperature regime. The data demonstrate that the parallel evolution of gene expression from standing genetic variation is positively correlated with the strength of pleiotropic effects. The ancestral variation in gene expression is, however, negatively correlated with parallelism. Given that pleiotropy is also negatively correlated with gene expression variation, we conducted a causal analysis to distinguish cause and correlation and evaluate the role of pleiotropy. The causal analysis indicated that both direct (causative) and indirect (correlational) effects of pleiotropy contribute to parallel evolution. The indirect effect is mediated by historic selective constraint in response to pleiotropy. This results in parallel selection responses due to the reduced standing variation of pleiotropic genes. The direct effect of pleiotropy is likely to reflect a genetic correlation among adaptive traits, which in turn gives rise to synergistic effects and higher parallelism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105059">Food intake enhances hippocampal sharp wave-ripples</a></h4>

              
                Effective regulation of energy metabolism is critical for survival. Metabolic control involves various nuclei within the hypothalamus, which receive information about the body’s energy state and coordinate appropriate responses to maintain homeostasis, such as thermogenesis, pancreatic insulin secretion, and food-seeking behaviors. It has recently been found that the hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory and spatial navigation, is also involved in metabolic regulation. Specifically, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), which are high-frequency neural oscillations supporting memory consolidation and foraging decisions, have been shown to reduce peripheral glucose levels. However, whether SWRs are enhanced by recent feeding—when the need for glucose metabolism increases, and if so, whether feeding-dependent modulation of SWRs is communicated to other brain regions involved in metabolic regulation—remains unknown. To address these gaps, we recorded SWRs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus of mice during sleep sessions before and after consumption of meals of varying caloric values. We found that SWRs occurring during sleep are significantly enhanced following food intake, with the magnitude of enhancement being dependent on the caloric content of the meal. This pattern occurred under both food-deprived and ad libitum feeding conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food intake, exhibit a robust SWR-triggered increase in activity. These findings identify the satiety state as a factor modulating SWRs and suggest that hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic communication is a potential mechanism by which SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism and food intake.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101101">Prophage-encoded Hm-oscar gene recapitulates Wolbachia-induced male-killing in the tea tortrix moth Homona magnanima</a></h4>

              
                <i>Wolbachia</i> are maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts that are ubiquitous among arthropods. They can hijack host reproduction in various ways, including male-killing (MK), where the sons of infected mothers are killed during development. The recent discovery of MK-associated <i>Wolbachia</i> genes, i.e., <i>oscar</i> in <i>Ostrinia</i> moths and <i>wmk</i> in <i>Drosophila</i> flies, stimulates our interest in the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, which remain largely unclear. We recently discovered that a <i>Wolbachia</i> symbiont of the moth <i>Homona magnanima</i> carries an MK-associated prophage region encoding homologs of <i>oscar</i> (<i>Hm-oscar</i>) and <i>wmk</i> (<i>wmk-</i>1–4). Here, we investigated the effects of these genes in the native host. Upon transient overexpression, <i>Hm-oscar</i>, but not <i>wmk</i>, induced male lethality in <i>H. magnanima</i>, in contrast to our observations in <i>Drosophila</i>, where the <i>wmk</i> homologs, but not <i>Hm-oscar</i>, killed the males. <i>Hm-oscar</i> disrupted sex determination in male embryos by inducing a female-type <i>doublesex</i> splicing and impaired dosage compensation, recapitulating the <i>Wolbachia</i> phenotype. Cell-based transfection assays confirmed that <i>Hm-oscar</i> suppressed the function of <i>masculinizer</i>, the primary male sex determinant involved in lepidopteran dosage compensation. Our study highlights the conserved roles of <i>oscar</i> homologs in <i>Wolbachia</i>-induced lepidopteran MK and argues that <i>Wolbachia</i> have evolved multiple MK mechanisms in insects.

                Task-fMRI analyses typically focus on localized activation contrasts between stimuli, neglecting the dynamic hierarchy of the brain. We introduce Brain Diffusion Transformer (Brain-DiT), a deep generative model capturing recurrent processing underlying individualized neurocognitive state transitions via functional networks. Without prior assumptions, Brain-DiT identifies canonical cognitive regions in the brain and reveals replicable subgroups with distinct neural circuits in large cohorts, offering critical clinical insights overlooked by traditional methods: individuals exhibiting negative emotion bias, linked to language-related regions, had a 12-fold higher likelihood of major depression, and those with maladaptive inhibition strategies, associated with overactive medial frontal regions, showed a 9-fold increased risk of alcohol abuse. By bridging cognitive theory and psychiatric applications, Brain-DiT provides a unified analytical paradigm, paving the way for operational personalized medicine in psychiatry.

">Experience reorganizes content-specific memory traces in macaques</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation requires neural activity reorganization during experience that persists in sleep. How these processes promote learning while preserving established memories remains unclear. We recorded neural ensemble activity from hippocampal and associated regions in freely moving macaques as they recalled item sequences presented that day ("new"), one day prior ("recent"), or over two weeks prior ("old"). Cell assemblies biased for old sequences showed less drift, greater network connectivity, and stronger sleep reactivation than new-biased assemblies. Pairs of old and recent assemblies formed persistent task-to-sleep coupling ("metassemblies"), unlike new assembly pairs. In the hippocampus, the propensity for superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells to form integrated assemblies increased with memory age. These findings reveal rapid organization and stabilization of neural activity in the primate brain, suggesting potential mechanisms for balancing learning with memory linking and durability.

">CO2 sensitive connexin channel synapses in the VTA release 5HT to regulate dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                It is now well established that the major mid-brain dopaminergic centre, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), plays an important role in the control of sleep-wake state transitions, producing arousal from sleep states upon activation. We recently showed that the VTA may also be involved in producing arousal in response to hypercapnia, a key survival response. We found that connexin 26 (Cx26) CO2-sensitive hemichannels are expressed by VTA GABAergic neurons and modulate their excitability. Here we have extended our investigation of VTA chemosensing and have discovered additional novel mechanisms of CO2 neural signalling: connexin co-synapses. CO2-sensitive hemichannels are expressed on the cell bodies and the terminals of dorsal raphe (DR) serotonergic neurons that cluster around VTA TH+ dopaminergic neurons colocalizing both with the 5HT transporter SERT and with VGLUT3. Using pharmacological dissection and GRAB5-HT sensors, we showed that 5HT can permeate through open Cx26 hemichannels to modulate the excitability of VTA dopamine neurons. Brief elevations of pCO2 regulate dopaminergic neuron excitability via 5HT3 and 5HT2A/C receptors activation. Longer applications of raised pCO2 modulates HCN channel opening in response to hyperpolarizing current steps, an effect blocked by 5HT2 receptor antagonists. These effects of pCO2 can be blocked with the connexin inhibitor lanthanum. In vivo, CO2 challenge (hypercapnia) activates VTA neurons (including dopaminergic neurons), with the activation greatly reduced by the conditional knockdown of Cx26 expression in the VTA. We therefore propose that the VTA could play an important role in hypercapnic arousal with at least two distinct mechanisms of CO2 signalling: modulation of GABAergic neuron excitability via soma Cx26 hemichannels and channel-mediated release of 5HT via CO2 sensitive Cx26 co-synapses on DR nerve terminals that regulate the excitability of dopaminergic neurons.

">Modeling AP2M1 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Genetic defects in AP2M1, which encodes the -subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), cause a rare form of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In this study, we modeled AP2M1-DEE in Drosophila melanogaster to gain deeper insights into the underlying disease mechanisms. Pan-neuronal knock-down of the Drosophila AP2M1 ortholog, AP-2, resulted in a consistent heat-sensitive paralysis phenotype and altered morphology in class IV dendritic arborization (c4da) neurons. Unexpectedly, affected flies were resistant to antiseizure medications and exhibited increased resistance to electrically induced seizures. A CRISPR-engineered fly line carrying the recurrent human disease variant p.Arg170Trp displayed a milder seizure resistance phenotype. While these findings contrast with the human phenotype, they align with previous studies on other CME-related genes in Drosophila. Our results suggest that hyperexcitability and seizures in AP2M1-DEE may stem from broader defects in neuronal development rather than direct synaptic dysfunction.

">Glia phagocytose neuronal sphingolipids to infiltrate developing synapses</a></h4>

              
                The complex morphologies of mature neurons and glia emerge through profound rearrangements of cell membranes during development. Despite being integral components of these membranes, it is unclear whether lipids might actively sculpt these morphogenic processes. By analyzing lipid levels in the developing fruit fly brain, we discover dramatic increases in specific sphingolipids coinciding with neural circuit establishment. Disrupting this sphingolipid bolus via genetic perturbations of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism leads to impaired glial autophagy. Remarkably, glia can obtain sphingolipid precursors needed for autophagy by phagocytosing neurons. These precursors are then converted into specific long-chain ceramide phosphoethanolamines (CPEs), invertebrate analogs of sphingomyelin. These lipids are essential for glia to arborize and infiltrate the brain, a critical step in circuit maturation that when disrupted leads to reduced synapse numbers. Taken together, our results demonstrate how spatiotemporal tuning of sphingolipid metabolism during development plays an instructive role in programming brain architecture.

                PsiConnect is a large-scale neuroimaging study designed to investigate the neural and subjective effects of psilocybin using multimodal neuroimaging. It combines functional, structural, and diffusion-weighted MRI with EEG to examine brain activity in 62 participants before and after a 19 mg dose of psilocybin. The design includes resting-state scans and three naturalistic conditions: guided meditation, music listening, and movie watching. Half of the cohort underwent an 8-week meditation training program, enabling the exploration of interactions among meditation, psilocybin, and brain function. The fMRI data was obtained through multi-echo fMRI, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces susceptibility artifacts, thereby improving the reliability of the analyses. A comprehensive battery of behavioural and self-report measures captured both acute and longitudinal cognitive and subjective effects, with follow-ups extending to one year post-administration. The large sample size, multimodal neuroimaging, diversity of contexts, and longitudinal behavioural follow-ups enable the study of psilocybin-induced changes in brain and behaviour with an unprecedented level of detail and reliability. Furthermore, the data is curated according to open science principles to ensure accessibility and interoperability with established neuroimaging processing pipelines. These factors make PsiConnect a valuable and highly reusable resource for researchers in cognitive and computational neuroscience.

">Dopaminergic drugs modulate fear extinction related processes in humans, but effects are mild</a></h4>

              
                The ability to extinguish learned fear responses is crucial for adaptive behavior. The mesolimbic dopaminergic system originating in the ventral tegmental area has been proposed to contribute to fear extinction learning because of its critical role in reward learning. The unexpected omission of aversive unconditioned stimuli (US) is considered as rewarding (outcome better than expected) and to drive extinction learning. We tested the hypothesis that extinction learning is facilitated by dopaminergic drugs and impeded by anti-dopaminergic drugs. The effects of dopamine agonists [levodopa (100 mg) and bromocriptine (1.25 mg)] and antagonists [tiapride (100 mg) and haloperidol (3 mg)] on fear extinction learning were compared to placebo in 146 young and healthy human participants. A three-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was performed with pupil size and skin conductance responses (SCRs) being recorded. Fear acquisition training was performed on day 1, extinction training on day 2, and recall was tested on day 3. The conditioned stimuli (CS+, CS-) consisted of two geometric figures. A short electrical stimulation was used as the aversive US. One of the four drugs or placebo was administered prior to the extinction phase on day 2. Overall, effects were small and seen only in the bromocriptine group. In line with our hypothesis, we measured reduced pupil dilation during late recall in the bromocriptine group compared to the placebo group, indicating faster re-extinction of spontaneously recovered fear reactions on the third day. Effects of levodopa and haloperidol were unspecific and related to generally increased SCR levels in the levodopa group (already prior to drug intake), and miotic side-effects of haloperidol. Findings provide additional support that the dopaminergic system contributes to extinction learning in humans, possibly by improving consolidation of fear extinction memory.

                Background Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a rare, a single-gene neurodevelopmental disorder. Atypical brain activation patterns have been linked to working memory difficulties in NF1 patients. The present work investigated if greater inhibitory activity underlies in interactions between neuronal populations in NF1 patients, as estimated with effective connectivity during working memory ask. Methods Forty-three adolescent patients with NF1 and twenty-six age-matched neurotypical controls completed functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during a verbal working memory task. Dynamic causal models were estimated for bilateral fronto-parietal network (dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC and vlPFC), superior and inferior parietal gyri (SPG and IPG)). Parametric empirical Bayes approach with Bayesian model reduction was used to test the hypothesis that NF1 diagnosis would be characterised by greater inhibitory self-connections (intrinsic connectivity). Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was performed to test the generalisability of group differences. Results NF1 participants have greater average connectivity of left dlPFC, IPG, SPG and bilateral vlPFC. The winning model of Bayesian model reduction investigating effects of working memory showed that NF1 patients have stronger intrinsic connectivity of left vlPFC, but weaker connectivity of right vlPFC and left dlPFC. The parameters of these connections were weakly predictive of NF1 diagnosis; correlation coefficient between true and predicted scores was 0.19 (p = 0.055) Conclusions Increased average connectivity of left dlPFC, IPG, SPG and bilateral vlPFC in NF1, suggests greater overall sensitivity of these regions to inputs. Working memory evoked different patterns of input processing in NF1, that cannot be characterised by increased inhibition alone. Instead, modulatory connectivity related to working memory showed more inhibitory self-connectivity of left dlPFC and left vlPFC, and less inhibitory intrinsic connectivity of right vlPFC in NF1. Importantly, this discrepancy between average and modulatory connectivity suggests that overall NF1 participants are responsive to cognitive task-related inputs but may show atypical adaptation to the task demands of working memory.

">Functional connectivity reveals increased network segregation and sensorimotor processing during working memory in adolescents with Neurofibromatosis Type 1</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic condition characterised by skin pigmentations, bone deformities, and tumours. Its cognitive phenotype shares similarities with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, including impairments in executive function and working memory processing. In this work, we conducted functional connectivity and graph theory analysis of fMRI data from a sample of neurotypical adolescents (N = 26) and a sample of adolescent NF1 - participants (N = 43). Whole brain comparisons demonstrated that during working memory conditions NF1 participants have greater connectivity in left posterior parietal regions, particularly converging at the postcentral gyrus. Comparison of communication between functional networks demonstrated that NF1 participants have increased connectivity between visual, sensorimotor, dorsal attention and limbic networks. Individual connections were weaker in NF1 participants across the brain, and we found reduced connectivity between control, dorsal attention and default networks in NF1. Furthermore, connectivity strength in these networks was predictive of accuracy and response time in NF1 participants during the task performance. Finally, graph theory analysis showed that working memory demands evoked reorganisation towards greater assortativity in NF1 participants, which was predictive of poorer accuracy and accuracy-speed trade-off. These findings highlight that NF1 participants' working memory deficits emerge from reduced engagement of executive processes, and NF1 participants demonstrate coping mechanisms such as enhanced sensorimotor processing and network reorganisation towards greater segregation, that is however detrimental to cognitive performance.

">Neuronal networks in the dorsal hippocampus causally regulate rescue behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behaviors, such as rescuing individuals in need, are crucial for social cohesion across species. While key brain regions involved in rescue behavior have been identified, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The hippocampus (HPC), known for its role in memory and spatial navigation, also contributes to emotional and social processing. However, its specific involvement in prosocial behavior is not well understood. Here, we investigate the causal role of the HPC in learning and executing rescue behavior in mice. Using chemogenetics, we show that the dorsal HPC (dHPC), but not the ventral HPC (vHPC), is essential for acquiring rescue behavior. Calcium imaging of the dHPC reveals network consolidation during successful rescues, with distinct synchronized ensembles and activity patterns linked to liberations of an individual in need. These findings establish a novel role for the dHPC in prosocial behavior, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying empathy-driven actions.

                Neuroimaging allows the study of brain structures that previously were undetectable due to their small size and location. Here-in we focused on the core catecholaminergic circuitries in the human brain, involving the coerulean noradrenergic (or norepi-nephrine, NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems. Using T1-weighted MRI morphometry and dMRI tractography, this study was carried out in one post-mortem human ultra-high-resolution dataset of the brainstem and diencephalon and in healthy human datasets from the Human Connectome Project repository. We investigated 26 connections of brainstem origin (13 in the left side and 13 in the right side) associated with the NE and DA circuitries. We delineated the coerulean NE and DA core central cate-cholaminergic circuitries of the brainstem and hypothalamus in the post-mortem dataset, including all targeted fiber connec-tions. Importantly, this was also achieved in the HCP datasets. These results emphasize the importance of multispectral neu-roimaging in the study of chemical neuroanatomical circuitries and its application in clinical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, major depression, schizophrenia, and other disorders associated with chronic stress and brain-immune interactions such as COVID-19.

">A mouse model of early sporadic tau pathology induces neurogenic plasticity in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration and the accumulation of insoluble amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, at the earliest stages of the disease cell death and pathological tau are localized to the entorhinal cortex. In particular, the lateral entorhinal cortex, and its functions in object-related memory, are among the most vulnerable in aging. Notably, the entorhinal cortex projects directly to the dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis proceeds throughout adult life. Immature, adult-born neurons provide a robust source of plasticity to the entorhinal-dentate pathway and they may be uniquely responsive, or vulnerable, to early entorhinal tau pathology. To test this, we injected a human tau-expressing recombinant adeno-associated virus into the lateral entorhinal cortex and used AsclCreER mice to birthdate downstream dentate neurons born in early postnatal development or adulthood. Consistent with known roles in neurodegeneration, lateral entorhinal tau expression caused a loss of mushroom spines in downstream dentate neurons and reduced dendritic complexity of adult-born neurons in male mice. Presynaptic tau also increased neurogenesis levels and increased the density of thin spines on adult-born neurons. Despite these morphological effects, tau did not alter synaptic strength or the magnitude of long-term potentiation at entorhinal synapses onto adult- or developmentally-born neurons. Thus, in a novel model of early sporadic tau pathology, there are morphological changes consistent with neurodegeneration but also compensatory neuroplastic changes, caused by neurogenesis. Since immature neurons have also been identified in the human dentate gyrus, a similar neurogenic plasticity may help maintain entorhinal-hippocampal formation in pathological aging.

">Mechanisms of long term non-reinforced preference change: functional connectivity changes in a longitudinal functional MRI study</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than one hour of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e. incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups, one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at 5 time points across one year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6-months for the non-reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the non-externally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default-mode and dorsal-attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and non-reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.

">Compression of functional gradients from rest to naturalistic processing: Moderation effect of age</a></h4>

              
                The functional cortical hierarchy of the human brain, a fundamental principle of brain organization, has been extensively characterized during resting state for healthy younger adults. However, functional re-organization during naturalistic settings, such as movie-watching, and its alterations across the adult lifespan remains poorly understood. Using resting-state and movie fMRI data from two large datasets, Cam-CAN (N=416) and DyNAMiC (N=156), this study conducted a comprehensive comparison of brain organization across two states. We identified a robust reorganization with compression of functional gradients from rest to movie-watching states, which is mediated by changes in functional integration and segregation of brain networks. The extent of compression from rest to movie was significantly greater in older adults and predicted worse cognitive performance among the elderly population. Our findings provide novel insights into how macroscale brain hierarchy is reorganized during naturalistic processing, and how this reorganization during aging impacts cognitive processes, offering a deeper understanding of the neural basis of aging and cognition.

">Anterior cingulate cortex mixes retrospective cognitive signals and ongoing movement signatures during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is believed to play a key role in reward-based learning in uncertain and dynamic environments. Recent work suggests that in these environments, ACC neurons monitor decisions and their outcomes to inform behavioral strategy. Yet, it remains unclear whether ACC neurons similarly encode behavioral history in fully deterministic perceptual decision-making tasks and, if so, how behavioral history signals interact with other signals that are represented by ACC neurons. Here, we recorded the activity of ACC neurons in freely moving mice performing a visual evidence accumulation task. Many ACC neurons had mixed selectivity: they were strongly driven by non-linear combinations of previous choices and outcomes (trial history). We observed that trial history could be decoded well from the ACC population and that the neural representations of trial history remained stable over multiple seconds. Using linear encoding models, we demonstrate that both trial history and movements strongly drive neural activity in the ACC. We found no relationship between trial history encoding and behavioral biases and instead observed that the neural dynamics encoding trial history were low-dimensional, similar between sessions from the same subjects and conserved across different subjects. These findings suggest the ACC might implement a trial history monitoring process that is independent of behavioral biases and common to different subjects.

">Attuning to song duels facilitates song-matching in nightingales</a></h4>

              
                Complex vocal communication requires precise, flexible adjustments to vocal-motor commands for the production of coherent responses to auditory inputs. The mechanisms underlying how such sensorimotor integration controls vocal production is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the dynamics of territorial vocal duels and song-matching in common nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos). Using a combination of field observations, playback experiments and accelerometry, we find that wild nightingales readily modified the acoustic features of their song, matched the rival's song and engaged more vigorously against vocal opponents with a shared song repertoire. Furthermore, we demonstrate that neurons in the sensorimotor nucleus HVC are tuned to specific song stimuli, potentially enabling context-specific integration of auditory information to facilitate matched song production. These findings highlight the crucial role of song recognition in allowing nightingales to adjust their vocalizations in response to specific social situations, demonstrating the complexity and adaptability of their communication system. Moreover, this study provides a new framework and model system for investigating online sensorimotor processing during dynamic vocal interactions.

Functional conservation among vertebrates was demonstrated (i) by performing the canonical PC-12 differentiation assay with the <i>S. canicula</i> NGF and (ii) by complementing the p75NTR absence in a PC-12 p75NTR<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> knock-out clone with the <i>S. canicula</i> p75NTR.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The p75NTR receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, can participate in signaling pathways either by forming heteromeric complexes with other receptors, such as the Trk family (tropomyosin receptor kinases), or by functioning independently. p75NTR was investigated prevalently in the brain and retina of mammals, whereas almost nothing is known about its conservation among species. Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic arb of p75NTR and described for the first time the p75NTR expression in the brain of the basal vertebrate Chondrichthyan <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> (<i>S. canicula</i>), uncovering the existing parallelism between ancient vertebrates and mammals. p75NTR functional conservation among vertebrates was further investigated by cloning the <i>S. canicula</i> nerve growth factor (NGF) and performing the canonical posterior commissure (PC)-12 differentiation assay, which results in standard neurite-like production. We then investigated the <i>S. canicula</i> p75NTR, which proves to be capable of complementing a specific clone of PC-12 lacking p75NTR (PC-12 p75NTR<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup>). All together, our results highlighted the expression and functional conservation of p75NTR among vertebrates during the evolution.</p>

                Objective: Digital representations of Purkinje cells from turtle cerebellum, which have long been to study cellular transmission dynamics and neuroplasticity, are necessary to conduct simulations of neuromodulation methods, including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Methods: Data collected using microCT with 0.6 um isometric resolution are processed, segmented, and arranged to enable high resolution simulation via the Boundary Element Fast Multipole Method. Results: Fully computer aided design compatible, manifold triangular surface meshes were generated from microCT data and used to simulate cellular electromagnetic response to TMS. Conclusion: Accurate Purkinje cells may be readily generated and manipulated to create representative models of turtle cerebellum. Significance: The techniques employed herein may be used to generate accurate surface mesh of Purkinje cells which can enable computational electromagnetics code verification and serve as the basis for skeletal models used for bidomain biophysical simulations in tools such as NEURON to study neurostimulation dynamics and neuromodulation.

">A ketogenic diet mitigates hippocampal astrogliosis in epileptic brain</a></h4>

              
                The ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for patients with medically intractable epilepsy and is chiefly characterized by high fat/low-carbohydrate intake and the production of ketone bodies (KB) such as {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). However, after more than a century of clinical use, the mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. While prior investigations have examined the effects of the KD and its metabolic substrates on synaptic transmission, few studies have explored a potential connection between astrocytic ion channels and seizure genesis. One essential function of astrocytes is spatial potassium buffering which influences passive potassium conductance (PPC), and when impaired, can result in neuronal hyperexcitability. In the present study, we demonstrate that the KD can mitigate hippocampal astrogliosis in the Kcna1-null (KO) mouse model of developmental epilepsy. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in GFAP expression in KO mice fed a control diet compared to wild-type (WT) mice, and that the KD prevented this change. Furthermore, we noted a reduction in hippocampal astrocytic PPC in epileptic mice, whereas KD-treated KO animals exhibited nearly normal passive conductance levels. In this regard, we found that while Kir4.1, TREK-1 and TWIK-1 RNA expression levels were not significantly altered by KD treatment in either WT or KO mice, BHB appeared to only minimally affect Kir4.1-mediated currents in transfected HEK cells. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq analysis of the various treatment groups revealed KD-induced down-regulation of factors linked to hippocampal astrogliosis. Our findings indicate that the KD protects against epilepsy-associated astrogliosis and astrocytic PPC changes, underscoring a novel mechanism of action, and implicate extracellular potassium in its anti-seizure effects.

                <p>A decline in cognitive abilities is associated with the aging process, affecting nearly 33% of US adults over the age of 70, and is a risk factor for the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Several studies have reported age-related alterations in the transcriptome in the hippocampus, a major site of memory storage that is among the first regions impacted with age, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. However, much remains unknown about why these transcriptional changes exist in the aged hippocampus and how this impacts memory late in life. Here, we show that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2Bubi), an epigenetic mechanism recently reported to be major regulator of the epigenome and transcriptome during memory formation in the young adult brain, decreases with age in the hippocampus of male rats. In vivo CRISPR-dCas9&ndash;mediated upregulation of <I>Rnf20</I>, the only ubiquitin E3 ligase for H2B, in the hippocampus significantly improved memory retention in aged rats. Remarkably, RNA-seq analysis revealed that in addition to the 18 genes typically upregulated in the aged rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning, <I>Rnf20</I> upregulation caused learning-related increases and decreases in 40 and 11 unique genes, respectively, suggesting that these 51 genes may be among those most critical for improving memory in advanced age. Together, these data suggest that H2B monoubiquitination is a significant regulator of age-related dysregulation of the transcriptome and impairments in memory.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms. Its pathological hallmarks include the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (&alpha;-Syn) in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Phosphorylation of &alpha;-Syn is a prominent feature of these inclusions, but its role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. To identify the role of &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation in synucleinopathy, we generated two <I>Snca</I> knock-in (KI) mouse models carrying phosphomimetic mutations at SncaY39 or SncaS129 (<I>Snca<sup>Y39E</sup></I> or <I>Snca<sup>S129D</sup></I>) which manipulated epitopes phosphorylated in the PD brain. Both <I>Snca<sup>Y39E</sup></I> and <I>Snca<sup>S129D</sup></I> KI mice displayed increased &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation, enhanced oligomer formation, and a shift of &alpha;-Syn localization from membrane-bound to cytoplasm. However, neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra was not observed up to 24&nbsp;months of age. These findings demonstrate that mimicking the phosphorylation of Y39 or S129 can induce endogenous &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation. Still, a single phosphomimetic mutation alone is insufficient to induce PD-like behavior and pathology in the mouse's lifespan. Overall, our study provides a mouse model for investigating the role of phosphorylation at Y39 and S129 &alpha;-Syn epitopes in vivo.</p>

Human affective experience varies along the dimensions of valence (positivity or negativity) and arousal (high or low activation). It remains unclear how these dimensions are represented in the brain and whether the representations are shared across different individuals and diverse situational contexts. In this study, we first utilized two publicly available functional MRI datasets of participants watching movies to build predictive models of moment-to-moment emotional arousal and valence from dynamic functional brain connectivity. We tested the models by predicting emotional arousal and valence both within and across datasets. Our results revealed a generalizable arousal representation characterized by the interactions between multiple large-scale functional networks. The arousal representation generalized to two additional movie-watching datasets with different participants viewing different movies. In contrast, we did not find evidence of a generalizable valence representation. Taken together, our findings reveal a generalizable representation of emotional arousal embedded in patterns of dynamic functional connectivity, suggesting a common underlying neural signature of emotional arousal across individuals and situational contexts. We have made our model and analysis scripts publicly available to facilitate its use by other researchers in decoding moment-to-moment emotional arousal in novel datasets, providing a new tool to probe affective experience using fMRI.

                <p>by Sander W Keemink, Mark CW van Rossum</p>

Throughout the brain information is coded in the activity of multiple neurons at once, so called population codes. Population codes are a robust and accurate way of coding information. One can evaluate the quality of population coding by trying to read out the code with a decoder, and estimate the encoded stimulus. In particular when neurons are noisy, coding accuracy has extensively been evaluated in terms of the trial-to-trial variation in the estimate. While most decoders yield unbiased estimators if neurons are actived, when only a few neurons are active, biases readily emerge. That is, even after averaging, a systematic difference between the true stimulus and its estimate remains. We characterize the shape of this bias for different encoding models (rectified cosine tuning and von Mises functions), show that it can be both attractive or repulsive for different stimulus values. Biases appear for maximum likelihood and Bayesian decoders. The biases have a non-trivial dependence on noise. We also introduce a technique to estimate the bias and variance of Bayesian least square decoders. The work is of interest to those studying neural populations with a few active neurons.

Epilepsy is a prevalent brain disorder, characterized by sudden, abnormal brain activity, making it difficult to live with. One-third of people with epilepsy do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. Drug-resistant epilepsy is treated with brain surgery. Successful surgical treatment relies on identifying brain regions responsible for seizure onset, known as epileptogenic zones (EZ). Despite various methods for EZ estimation, evaluating their efficacy remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth for empirical data. To address this, we generated and evaluated a cohort of 30 virtual epilepsy patients, using patient-specific anatomical and functional data from 30 real drug-resistant epilepsy patients. This personalized modeling, based on the patient’s brain data, is called a virtual brain twin. For each virtual patient, we provided data that included anatomically parcellated brain regions, structural connectivity, reconstructed intracranial electrodes, simulated brain activity at both the brain region and electrode levels, and key parameters of the virtual brain twin. These key parameters, which include the EZ hypothesis, serve as the ground-truth for simulated brain activity. For each virtual brain twin, we generated synthetic spontaneous seizures, stimulation-induced seizures and interictal activity. We systematically evaluated these simulated brain signals by quantitatively comparing them against their corresponding empirical intracranial recordings. Simulated signals based on patient-specific EZ captured spatio-temporal seizure generation and propagation. Through in-silico exploration of stimulation parameters, we also demonstrated the role of patient-specific stimulation location and amplitude in reproducing empirically stimulated seizures. The virtual epileptic cohort is openly available, and can be directly used to systematically evaluate methods for the estimation of EZ or source localization using ground truth EZ parameters and source signals.

Phylodynamic analyses infer epidemiological parameters from pathogen genome sequences for enhanced genomic surveillance in public health. Pathogen genome sequences and their associated sampling dates are the essential data in every analysis. However, sampling dates are usually associated with hospitalisation or testing and can sometimes be used to identify individual patients, posing a threat to patient confidentiality. To lower this risk, sampling dates are often given with reduced date-resolution to the month or year, which can potentially bias inference. Here, we introduce a practical guideline on when date-rounding biases the inference of epidemiologically important parameters across a diverse range of empirical and simulated datasets. We show that the direction of bias varies for different parameters, datasets, and tree priors, while compounding with lower date-resolution and higher substitution rates. We also find that bias decreases for datasets with longer sampling intervals, implying that our guideline is most applicable to emerging datasets. We conclude by discussing future solutions that prioritise patient confidentiality and propose a method for safer sharing of sampling dates that translates them them uniformly by a random number.

Hedgehog (Hh) proteins elicit dose-dependent transcriptional responses by binding Patched receptors to activate transmembrane Smoothened (Smo) proteins. Activated Smo inhibits Ci/Gli transcription factor phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A and consequent proteolytic processing to repressor forms; it also promotes nuclear transport and activity of full-length Ci/Gli proteins to induce Hh target genes. Smo-activated Fused (Fu) kinase drives Ci activation in <i>Drosophila</i>, while Suppressor of Fused (Su(fu)) counters full-length Ci/Gli activity and stabilizes full-length Ci/Gli by direct binding to at least three surfaces. Here, we used CRISPR-generated designer <i>ci</i> alleles to investigate alterations to Fu phosphorylation sites and to regions around Ci–Su(fu) interfaces under physiological conditions in <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal wing discs. Surprisingly, we identified alterations that activate Ci without significant loss of stabilization by Su(fu) and contributions of multiple Fu target sites to Ci activation in the absence of Su(fu), suggesting that the affected sites mediate Ci activation by regulating Ci–Ci, rather than Ci–Su(fu) interactions. We propose that those interactions maintain full-length Ci in a closed conformation that also facilitates, and is stabilized by, cooperative Ci–Su(fu) binding. Access to binding partners necessary for Ci activation is promoted through phosphorylation of at least four Fu sites on Ci, likely by directly disrupting Ci–Ci contacts and one Ci–Su(fu) interface without substantial Ci–Su(fu) dissociation, contrary to previous proposals. We also found that the Ci binding partner, Costal 2 (Cos2), which silences Ci in the absence of Hh, can facilitate Ci activation by Fu kinase.

Multiple myeloma (MM) arises through oncogenic transformation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. MM often co-opts the central endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress mitigator, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), to sustain malignant growth. While certain MMs require enzymatic IRE1-dependent activation of the transcription factor XBP1s, others display a nonenzymatic IRE1 dependency that is not yet mechanistically understood. Here we identify interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which stimulates genes that promote immune-cell proliferation, as a key conduit for IRE1’s nonenzymatic control of cell-cycle progression in MM. IRE1 silencing increased inhibitory S114/S270 phosphorylation on IRF4, disrupting IRF4’s chromatin-binding and transcriptional activity. IRF4 knockdown recapitulated, whereas IRF4 repletion reversed the anti-proliferative phenotype of IRE1 silencing. Furthermore, phospho-deficient, but not phospho-mimetic, IRF4 mutants rescued proliferation under IRE1 silencing. Functional studies revealed that IRF4 engages the <i>E2F1</i> and <i>CDC25A</i> genes and promotes CDK2 activation to drive cell-cycle progression. Our results advance mechanistic understanding of IRE1 and IRF4 in MM.

Regulatory T cell (Treg) heterogeneity exists in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but we have limited understanding of context-dependent functions and spatiotemporal regulators of heterogenous Treg states, especially during perinatal life when immune tolerance is established. Here, we revealed that the class III PI3K Vps34 orchestrates effector Treg (eTreg) transitional heterogeneity during perinatal life. We found that loss of Vps34 reduced terminal eTreg accumulation in lymphoid tissues, associated with decreased Treg generation in non-lymphoid tissues and development of an early-onset autoimmune-like disease. After perinatal life, Vps34-deficient eTreg accumulation was further impaired due to reduced cell survival, highlighting temporal regulation of eTreg heterogeneity and maintenance by Vps34. Accordingly, inhibition of Vps34 in mature Tregs disrupted immune homeostasis but boosted anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, multiomics profiling approaches uncovered that Vps34-orchestrated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling promotes terminal eTreg programming. Further, via genetic deletion of the Vps34-interacting proteins Atg14 or Uvrag in Tregs, we established that Atg14 but not Uvrag was required for the overall survival, but not terminal differentiation, of eTregs, suggesting that autophagy but not endocytosis partly contributed to Vps34-dependent effects. Accordingly, mice with Treg-specific loss of Atg14, but not Uvrag, had moderately disrupted immune homeostasis and reduced tumor growth, with Vps34- or Atg14-dependent gene signatures also being elevated in intratumoral Tregs from human cancer patients. Collectively, our study reveals distinct Vps34-orchestrated signaling events that regulate eTreg heterogeneity and functional adaptation and the pathophysiological consequences on autoimmunity versus anti-tumor immunity.

Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models in a recessive manner. Homozygosity for rs12608932-C in <i>UNC13A</i> was associated with a shorter survival compared with other genotypes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.033), which has implications for patient counselling and trial design.

                Background/Objectives The relation between TMD and posterior tooth loss is still up for debate and is a topic of constant discussion. The present study aimed to find a correlation between posterior teeth loss and TMJ disorder symptoms in adult patients. Methods A total of fifty patients were selected for the study. First, intra-oral dental examination recorded all missing posterior teeth, the teeth numbers, type of missing teeth (except third molars). All existing teeth are examined during the clinical examination to identify any odontogenic causes for pain if present. Second, patients were asked to fill in the Arabic-translated form of the DC/TMD Axis I symptom questionnaire. Third, the DC/TMD Axis II protocol was applied to each patient and the examination form was completed by the examiner during the clinical examination. Results Disc displacement with reduction is more likely to cause headache, pain, and clicking. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between age and the number of missing teeth. Furthermore, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between age and maximum unassisted mouth opening, and the number of missing teeth and maximum unassisted mouth opening. Logistics regression analysis showed clicking was significantly associated and 13.8 (OR) times more likely to have TMD. Conclusions The current study reported that patients with TMD are more likely to have pain, headache, clicking, and a decrease in maximum mouth opening. There was a correlation between clicking and TMJ disorder, and the number of tooth loss and TMJ disorder.

                Background The loss of cultural identity in the rural architecture of Rumicruz, Chimborazo, is a consequence of the adoption of generic models and unsustainable modern materials, which has affected thermal comfort and the connection with local traditions. This research proposes sustainable housing that combines vernacular and modern techniques, respecting both the environment and the community's needs. Method Based on a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative), the architectural, social, and environmental context was analyzed through a field diagnosis, literature review and critical observation. During this process, problems related to thermal comfort, housing deterioration, and the use of inadequate materials were identified. The proposal includes the use of mudbrick, stone, and concrete blocks, complemented with solar heating systems and energy efficiency, significantly improving thermal comfort compared to traditional housing. Conclusions It is concluded that the proposal integrates cultural identity and sustainability, adapting traditional techniques to current demands. The bioclimatic analysis and design support the thermal comfort values, highlighting the relevance of designs adapted to the local context.

                Stroke disrupts brain structure, leading to long-term disabilities despite improved survival rates. Patients often face cognitive, sensory, and motor deficits, with incomplete spontaneous recovery. Early intervention is crucial, as significant motor improvements happen within three months, while cognitive enhancements may take months to years. Recently, the periosteal traction (PD) technique has gained traction in treating chronic lower limb ischemia, with speculation that it effectively promotes angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. This paper presents three cases of stroke patients managed with PD technology in the late chronic stage, showing significant functional improvements. PD treatment may restore brain function by enhancing neuroplasticity and improving blood flow in ischemic areas. Although results are promising, limitations include a small sample size and short follow-up, with further research needed to optimize treatment protocols and understand underlying mechanisms. In conclusion, PD shows good potential for functional recovery in stroke patients, warranting further basic and clinical studies to bolster its application.

                Introduction Prion diseases are mortal neurodegenerative disorders, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Due to its heterogenous clinical presentation diagnosis uncertainties are common. In this paper we explore CJD diagnostic challenges focusing on differential diagnosis and diagnostic delays. Methods We report a case of a patient who was misclassified and evaluated by several medical specialties before the CJD suspicion. A systematic review of the literature of the CJD case reports focused on the timely and differential diagnosis was carried out in Medline and Embase until May 2023. Results Patient with diagnosis was made due to the form of presentation and clinical evolution, neuroimaging and the presence of protein 14-3-3. In systematic review, fifteen articles were selected, who reported 31 cases of CJD with problems in the timely diagnosis and incorrect initial diagnosis, the main initial differential diagnoses were psychiatry exacerbation, myelopathy, epilepsy, stroke, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autoimmune encephalitis. The most common clinical onset was psychobehavioral disturbances (apathy, confusion and sleep disturbance), extrapyramidal signs and cognitive impairment. The diagnosis delay was from one to eighteen months. Conclusion A discussion of the case report and the diagnostic challenges reported in the literature was made. Patients can present a wide range of symptoms. It is recommended to consider CJD for the differential diagnosis in patients with behavioral symptoms, and cognitive impairment.

                Background Addressing preservice teachers' emotions can help them develop the emotional connections necessary for successful teaching practicums and professional learning experiences. To understand preservice teachers’ emotions towards their surroundings, the researchers used an emotional geography framework to map out the source of their negative and positive emotions and how those feelings affect their beliefs, teaching style, and paradigms. Emotional geographies were divided into two categories (i.e., emotional distance and emotional closeness), which were further mapped into five major themes (i.e., sociocultural, moral, professional, physical, and political). This study aims to investigate the emotional geographies of graduate preservice teachers during their teaching practicums in Indonesia by adapting Hargreaves’ (2001) theoretical model, thereby identifying key dimensions and validating the adapted framework. Methods This study examined emotional geographies of 15 graduate preservice student teachers of Teacher Training and Education Faculty of Mulawarman University during their teaching practicums. Moreover, this study used a qualitative design involving semi-structured interviews with 15 graduate students who completed their teaching practicums. Results The participants experienced all emotional geographies (sociocultural, moral, professional, physical, and political) that reshaped their beliefs and teaching styles, especially related to teaching undergraduate students. These emotions are generally experienced when the participants deal with the students and cooperating teachers. Conclusions It was found that teachers needed to be strict when instilling discipline in their students, develop friendships with their students to maintain classroom control, and require comprehensive preparation to create teacher's confidence and answer their students' questions. In effect, the theoretical framework of emotional geography when teaching undergraduates during practicums gave student teachers valuable experience to cope with all common teaching challenges and professional growth.

                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and the availability of learning resources, such as limited access to the internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which need to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

<p>The importance of precision rehabilitation plans for traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) patients is emphasized by their need for long-term survival strategies. Quantitative MRI assessments have shown that patients with chronic TSCI undergo distinct stages of neural structural changes, providing a basis for precision treatment in healthcare.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The prolonged survival of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) patients underscores the need to customize rehabilitative treatment plans according to patients' characteristics, aiming to restore motor function. We conducted a cross-sectional study of two groups with chronic TSCI (short-term group: 11 patients with an injury time of 1–2 years; long-term group: 10 patients with an injury time &gt; 2 years) and 16 controls. Quantitative MRI was used to evaluate structural changes in the upper spinal cord and brain. Compared to controls, both groups exhibited decreased fractional anisotropy (close relationship of the decreased) in the spinal cord, and the long-term group showed reduced spinal cord cross-sectional areas. The short-term group presented increased gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus, and supplementary motor area, indicating compensatory neural changes, whereas the long-term group exhibited decreased GMV in cerebellar lobule VI, suggesting weakening of the signal received by the cerebellum. Track-based spatial statistics revealed the close relationship of the decreased FA was with the increased radial diffusivity in the long-term group, indicating that demyelination mainly altered the white matter. Correlation analysis revealed that the increased GMV was negatively correlated with the sensorimotor score (<i>r</i> = −0.725, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Additionally, the GMV of cerebellar lobule VI was positively correlated with the sensorimotor score (<i>r</i> = 0.671, <i>p</i> = 0.024). In summary, quantitative MRI identifies structural changes in the brain and spinal cord of patients with chronic TSCI that vary with the time since injury and provide imaging evidence for the development of precise targeted therapies.</p>

                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.
