                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group of all tested groups. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Abstract: Fetal transverse lie with neglected shoulder presentation is a rare but extremely risky complication in labor. It could severely compromise maternal and fetal outcome. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old multiparous patient, consulting in labor with a fetal hand prolapsed through the vaginal opening and a transverse presentation that was not known previously. An emergency cesarean section was performed. It allowed the extraction of a living, healthy newborn without further complications. This case report emphasizes the importance of prenatal follow-up, in particular, the screening of abnormal fetal positioning in term pregnancy. It also highlights that a prompt and swift transfer to a well-equipped medical facility is imperative for optimal maternal and fetal management and to ensure a positive outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-973/v3?src=rss">Sexual dysfunction and other prolactin-related side effects of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: Protocol for a systematic review with single-arm, pairwise, and network meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies [version </a></h4>

              
                Introduction Sexual dysfunctions are common yet underreported side effects of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, affecting 30-80% of treated individuals. These side effects can severely impact social interactions and treatment adherence for individuals with schizophrenia, but comprehensive comparative evidence assessing the risk profiles of different antipsychotics is lacking. This study aims to address this gap using network meta-analysis that integrates data from both randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS). Protocol This systematic review will include both RCTs and NRS focusing on participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses, without restrictions on symptoms, gender, ethnicity, age, or setting. For interventions, all second-generation antipsychotics will be included. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one sexual adverse event of any kind. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of any sexual adverse event evaluated in men and women separately, and any adverse event related to the three phases of sexual response cycle separately: desire (e.g. libido, sexual thoughts), arousal (e.g. erection, lubrication) and orgasm (e.g. ejaculation, anorgasmia), and any adverse effect related to breast dysfunction and menstruation irregularities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 and ROBINS-I will be employed to evaluate the risk of bias for RCTs and NRS, respectively. Single-arm meta-analysis of proportions will synthesize the average frequency of sexual adverse events in treated participants. Pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs and NRS will be used to evaluate comparative tolerability. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will explore possible heterogeneity in results and validate the findings’ robustness. The quality of the evidence will be evaluated using GRADE. Discussion This study will provide vital insights into the sexual side effects of antipsychotics by combining evidence from clinical trials and real-world practice, facilitating better decision-making in choosing the optimal antipsychotic for individuals.

                Background Industrial wastewater significantly affects the microbiome and resistome of aquatic ecosystems, posing environmental and public health risks through the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Methods This study systematically reviewed the influence of industrial effluents on microbial community structure and ARG prevalence in receiving water bodies. Results Our findings revealed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominate polluted environments, with beta-lactamases, macrolides, and sulfonamide resistance genes that are frequently detected. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including integrons and plasmids, are critical drivers of ARG horizontal gene transfer. The limited efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in removing ARGs highlights the urgent need for advanced treatment technologies. Comparisons with the existing literature reinforce the role of industrial activities in exacerbating ARG risks and disrupting microbial diversity. Mitigation strategies including stringent regulatory frameworks, advanced filtration methods, and a one-health approach are recommended to address these challenges. Conclusion This study emphasizes the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration and targeted interventions to safeguard environmental and public health from the impacts of industrial wastewater pollution.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Recent research highlights the role of kinetic chain and core muscle involvement in disease progression, yet evidence for structured core activation protocols such as CARE-KOA© remains limited.This study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of CARE-KOA©, which specifically targets proximal stability and biomechanical deficits in KOA, aiming to enhance pain, function, and core endurance beyond conventional approaches. Methods This prospective single-group pre-post study assessed the effect of a Participants underwent a 4-week CARE-KOA© regimen (12 supervised sessions, each including a 10-minute warm-up and core-focused exercises). Pre- and post-intervention assessments included pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), patient-reported outcomes (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), physical function tests (30-second sit-to-stand, 40-meter fast-paced walk, stair climb, timed up-and-go), and knee muscle strength and core endurance. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests in JAMOVI. Results Significant improvements were observed in pain at rest (mean change: 1.13 cm, p = 0.0006, d = 1.07) and during activity (mean change: 2.46 cm, p = 0.000001, d = 1.76), patient-reported outcomes (KOOS Pain: p = 0.00003, d = -0.83; KOOS ADL: p = 0.0000009, d = -1.19), and core endurance (p = 0.027, d = 0.21). Physical function tests also improved (stair climb: p = 0.031, d = 0.34; timed up-and-go: p = 0.006, d = 0.13). Muscle strength gains were significant in flexors of the unaffected knee and extensors of the affected knee (p < 0.05), while other muscle groups showed no significant change. Conclusion The CARE-KOA© program led to clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, and core endurance, highlighting the value of core activation strategies in KOA management. Future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted to confirm these benefits and optimize exercise protocols.

                Background Anorectal hemorrhoids are a common condition that frequently needs surgery in more challenging situations. Both stapled hemorrhoidectomy and conventional hemorrhoidectomy are standard surgical procedures, each one with various advantages and disadvantages as well. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of these two operations concerning patient satisfaction, complications, recovery time and postoperative pain. Method This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted in Karbala, Iraq, at AL-Kafeel Hospital and AL-Safeer Hospital. Information has been collected from patients who had stapled hemorrhoidectomy in 2023–2024 and those who had conventional hemorrhoidectomy from 2015–2018. To account for baseline variations, especially those related to the kind of anesthetic and extent of hemorrhoids, propensity score matching (caliper = 0.05) was employed. SPSS version 29.0 was used for statistical analysis, and comparisons were made by using t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analyses. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Out of 114 patients (50 conventional, 64 stapled), the stapled group had a higher percentage of fourth-degree hemorrhoids, postoperative pain and bleeding were significantly lower in the stapled group (p < 0.001), and only the conventional group had wound infections and anal stenosis (p < 0.05). The stapled group also showed better postoperative outcomes. Conclusion Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is linked to less pain, fewer complications, and faster recovery than conventional hemorrhoidectomy, but the risk of recurrent hemorrhoidectomy is still a concern. These findings support that surgical decision-making in hemorrhoid management can be optimized.

                Objectives This study aimed to examine health security (HeS) patterns across European Union (EU) member states to address intra-regional disparities in health security, align with EU-wide policy objectives, and propose evidence-based recommendations for harmonizing preparedness measures while respecting national sovereignty Methods This research employed a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making framework, combining the Entropy Weight Method and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo), to assess and rank EU countries, drawing on six Global Health Security Index indicators. K-means clustering classified countries into three performance tiers: High, Intermediate, and Dangerous. Data from the GHSI (2019, 2021) and the aggregated 2017–2021 period were analyzed to track temporal trends and cross-regional performance disparities. A comparative analysis of HeS priorities with the African and Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) Regions further contextualized the EU's HeS landscape. Results Detection and Reporting, and Rapid Response emerged as the most critical dimensions influencing performance, while Risk Environment and Compliance with Norms showed minimal differentiation. High-performing countries, such as Finland and Germany, demonstrated resilience in surveillance and rapid response, while lower-tier nations, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, and Romania, exhibited systemic vulnerabilities in biosecurity and emergency planning. Post-2019, health system resilience gained prominence, while compliance and risk environment remained neglected. The temporal analysis highlighted post-pandemic shifts in health system disparities. Cross-regional comparisons underscoring context-specific challenges. Conclusion This study highlights the need for targeted investments in surveillance systems, laboratory infrastructure, and crisis preparedness to address specific gaps in different clusters. A metrics-driven framework can reduce regional disparities, promoting equity in preparedness. Policymakers should adopt a collaborative approach to mitigate crises, using high-performing clusters as benchmarks.

                In the anterior area of the mouth, the interdental papilla is important for dental hygiene and appearance. When it disappears, unpleasant “black triangles” form, which affects patients’ self-confidence in their smiles and makes oral hygiene more difficult. The loss of interdental papilla is caused by several variables such as tooth shape, periodontal disease, and aging. Although surgical treatments have been utilized to restore or retain missing papilla, their predictability remains unknown. In response, researchers have investigated non-invasive procedures, such as the use of fillers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). Owing to its capacity to increase tissue volume and bind water, HA, a naturally occurring polysaccharide with special rheological qualities, has become a popular choice for use as a dermal filler. It shows promise when used to cure interdental papilla loss; the effects usually last for six–12 months. This review article explores the development and history of papilla rebuilding methods, emphasizing hyaluronic acid as a cutting-edge and successful method for regaining both periodontal health and aesthetics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-332/v2?src=rss">Are Narrative CVs contributing towards shifting research culture? Workshop Report from the 2023 Recognition and Rewards Festival [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Over the past decade, calls for research assessment reform have grown, led by initiatives such as the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Leiden Manifesto, and, more recently, the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA). A key element being discussed as part of research assessment reform is a shift towards more qualitative assessments, focussed on the content of research and the broad skills and competencies of researchers, and the array of contributions they make to knowledge creation and innovation. Narrative CV formats have emerged as a good practice example for enabling qualitative assessments of research projects and researchers, and are becoming more widely piloted and implemented. Methods As part of the 2023 Dutch Recognition and Rewards Festival, the authors hosted a workshop to gather perspectives on Narrative CVs, including whether and how they may contribute to shifts in research culture that are needed to support research assessment reform. Results Participants, representing research organisations and the research community, discussed both beneficial and critical aspects of narrative-style CV implementations from their experiences. The effects observed since narrative CVs have been implemented were discussed, with perspectives provided on career prospects and the empowerment of the research community to direct change. Finally, the discussion turned to expectations for the future, with workshop participants calling for focus on the roles that narrative-style CVs can play in improving research careers, recognition of collaborative work, and equality, diversity, and inclusion. A short informal survey exploring levels of implementation of narrative CVs across different research organisations was run prior to the workshop, the results of which are also presented as part of this report. Discussion The authors intend to expand this discussion to other scientific and policy conferences, and this report serves as a basis for a wider and deeper dialogue in the community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-549/v2?src=rss">ALL-IN meta-analysis: breathing life into living systematic reviews and prospective meta-analyses [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Science is justly admired as a cumulative process (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), yet scientific knowledge is typically built on a patchwork of research contributions without much coordination. This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations against avoidable research waste and for living systematic reviews and prospective meta-analysis. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides meta-analysis based on e-values and anytime-valid confidence intervals that can be updated at any time—reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error and coverage guarantees, live—no need to prespecify the looks, and leading—in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information without losing validity to accumulation bias. The analysis design requires no information about the trial sample sizes or the number of trials eventually included. So ALL-IN meta-analysis can be applied retrospectively as well as prospectively, to evaluate the evidence once or sequentially. Because the intention of the analysis does not change the validity of the results, the results of the analysis can change the intentions (‘optional stopping’ and ‘optional continuation’ based on the results so far). On the one hand: any analysis can be turned into a living one, or even become prospective and real-time by updating with new trial data and including interim data from trials that are still ongoing — without any changes in the cut-offs for testing or the method for interval estimation. On the other hand: no stopping rule needs to be enforced for the analysis to remain valid, so participating in a prospective meta-analysis does not require outside control over data collection. Hence ALL-IN meta-analysis breathes life into living systematic reviews, and offers better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication.

                <p>by Yan Miao, Xuan Tang, Chunyu Wang, Zhenyuan Sun, Guohua Wang, Shan Huang</p>

Circular RNA, a class of RNA molecules gaining widespread attentions, has been widely recognized as a potential biomarker for many diseases. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of the associations between circRNA and diseases. However, traditional experimental methods are often inefficient and costly, making computational models an effective alternative. Nevertheless, existing computational methods still face challenges such as data sparsity and the difficulty of confirming negative samples, which limits the accuracy of predictions. To address these challenges, a novel computational method, namely MVHGCN, is proposed based on multi-view and graph convolutional networks to predict potential associations between circRNA and diseases. MVHGCN first constructs a heterogeneous graph and generates feature descriptors by integrating multiple databases. Then it extracts different connection views of circRNA and diseases through meta-paths, maximizing the utilization of known association information, and aggregates deep feature information through graph convolutional networks. Finally, a MLP is used to predict the association scores. The experimental results show that MVHGCN significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets by 5-fold cross-validation. This research provides an effective new approach to studying the associations between circRNAs and diseases, capable of alleviating the problem of data sparsity and accurately identifying potential associations.

                <p>by Nicholas A. Rondoni, Fan Lu, Daniel B. Turner-Evans, Marcella Gomez</p>

Calcium imaging techniques, such as two-photon imaging, have become a powerful tool to explore the functions of neurons and the connectivity of their circuitry. Frequently, fluorescent calcium indicators are taken as a direct measure of neuronal activity. These indicators, however, are slow relative to behavior, obscuring functional relationships between an animal’s movements and the true neuronal activity. As a consequence, the firing rate of a neuron is a more meaningful metric. Converting calcium imaging data to the firing of a neuron is nontrivial. Most state-of-the-art methods depend largely on non-mechanistic modeling frameworks such as neural networks, which do not illuminate the underlying chemical exchanges within the neuron, require significant data to be trained on, and cannot be implemented in real-time. Leveraging modeling frameworks from chemical reaction networks (CRN) coupled with a control theoretic approach, a new algorithm is presented leveraging a fully deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This framework utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to challenge state-of-the-art correlation scores while retaining interpretability. Furthermore, these computations can be done in real time, thus, enabling online experimentation informed by neuronal firing rates. To demonstrate the use cases of this architecture, it is tested on ground truth datasets courtesy of the <i>spikefinder</i> challenge. Finally, we propose potential applications of the model for guiding experimental design.

                Schneiderova et al. demonstrate an association between EBV reactivation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and host interleukin 1 genetics in individuals with long COVID. Anti-VCA IgA serum levels, a strong marker of recent EBV reactivation, are associated with a high latent EBV load in blood and objective long-term pulmonary dysfunction in long COVID.

                Can et al. show that circulating group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) rapidly migrate from the intestine to the lung after helminth infection. These early responders bolster type-2 immunity and barrier repair, highlighting a key gut-lung axis and distinguishing them from bone marrow-derived and tissue-resident ILC2 populations.

                Park et al. show that GOT1, a key enzyme of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), is selectively upregulated by cold in brown adipose tissue and acts as a molecular switch, turning on the MAS. Cold-activated MAS is essential for supporting mitochondrial fuel preference for fatty acids over glucose.

                The mechanism of leptin resistance, the major contributor to DIO, remains elusive. Li et al. found that leptin receptor-negative Arc GABAergic neurons (non-LepR neurons) were activated by HFD feeding, that their activation caused leptin-resistant obesity, and that inhibition reduced/reversed DIO, revealing aberrant activation of these neurons as an alternative mechanism underlying leptin resistance.

                Van Hooff et al. reconstruct the evolutionary histories of eukaryotic SMC complexes, molecular machineries that organize chromosomes. SMC complexes were fully present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) but have been frequently lost during evolution. Remarkably, these complexes originated from an ancient duplication in archaeal ancestors, suggesting that sophisticated chromosome organization predated eukaryotes.

                Liu et al. show that the choline transporters SLC44A1/5 are required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in mouse postnatal brains. Specifically, SLC44A1 deletion in oligodendrocytes inhibits myelin sheath formation due to decreased plasmalogen synthesis. Choline transporters may be potential targets for myelin deficit-related diseases.

                Han et al. provide evidence suggesting that global brain activity and its coupling with CSF inflow are correlated with tau deposition in higher-order association regions in AD. Using fMRI and PET, they demonstrate that dynamic traveling waves across hierarchal cortices resemble tau spreading in AD and account for its inter-subject variability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103714">Salmonella exploits host- and bacterial-derived β-alanine for replication inside host macrophages</a></h4>

              
                <i>Salmonella</i> is a major foodborne pathogen that can effectively replicate inside host macrophages to establish life-threatening systemic infections. <i>Salmonella</i> must utilize diverse nutrients for growth in nutrient-poor macrophages, but which nutrients are required for intracellular <i>Salmonella</i> growth is largely unknown. Here, we found that either acquisition from the host or de novo synthesis of a nonprotein amino acid, β-alanine, is critical for <i>Salmonella</i> replication inside macrophages. The concentration of β-alanine is decreased in <i>Salmonella</i>-infected macrophages, while the addition of exogenous β-alanine enhances <i>Salmonella</i> replication in macrophages, suggesting that <i>Salmonella</i> can uptake host-derived β-alanine for intracellular growth. Moreover, the expression of <i>panD,</i> the rate-limiting gene required for β-alanine synthesis in <i>Salmonella,</i> is upregulated when <i>Salmonella</i> enters macrophages. Mutation of <i>panD</i> impaired <i>Salmonella</i> replication in macrophages and colonization in the mouse liver and spleen, indicating that de novo synthesis of β-alanine is essential for intracellular <i>Salmonella</i> growth and systemic infection. Additionally, we revealed that β-alanine influences <i>Salmonella</i> intracellular replication and in vivo virulence partially by increasing expression of the zinc transporter genes <i>znuABC</i>, which in turn facilitates the uptake of the essential micronutrient zinc by <i>Salmonella</i>. Taken together, these findings highlight the important role of β-alanine in the intracellular replication and virulence of <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>panD</i> is a promising target for controlling systemic <i>Salmonella</i> infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101128">Efficacy and mechanism of action of cipargamin as an antibabesial drug candidate</a></h4>

              
                Babesiosis is a disease brought on by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus <i>Babesia</i>. Current chemotherapies are accompanied by side effects and parasite relapse. Therefore, it is crucial to develop highly effective drugs against <i>Babesia</i>. Cipargamin (CIP) has shown inhibition against apicomplexan parasites, mainly <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Toxoplasma</i>. This study evaluated the growth-inhibiting properties of CIP against <i>Babesia</i> spp. and investigated the mechanism of CIP on <i>B. gibsoni</i>. The half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of CIP against the in vitro growth of <i>B. bovis</i> and <i>B. gibsoni</i> were 20.2 ± 1.4 and 69.4 ± 2.2 nM, respectively. CIP significantly inhibited the growth of <i>B. microti</i> and <i>B. rodhaini</i> in vivo. Resistance was conferred by L921V and L921I mutations in BgATP4, which reduced the sensitivity to CIP by 6.1- and 12.8-fold. The inhibitory potency of CIP against BgATP4-associated ATPase activity was moderately reduced in mutant strains, with a 1.3- and 2.4-fold decrease in BgATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and BgATP4<sup>L921I</sup>, respectively, compared to that of BgATP4<sup>WT</sup>. An in silico investigation revealed reductions in affinity for CIP binding to BgATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and BgATP4<sup>L921I</sup> compared to BgATP4<sup>WT</sup>. Resistant strains showed no significant cross-resistance to atovaquone or tafenoquine succinate (TQ), with less than a onefold change in IC<sub>50</sub> values. Combining CIP with TQ effectively eliminated <i>B. microti</i> infection in SCID mice with no relapse, and parasite DNA was not detected by qPCR within 90 days post-infection. Our findings reveal the efficacy of CIP as an antibabesial agent, its limitations as a monotherapy due to resistance development, and the potential of combination therapy with TQ to overcome said resistance and achieve complete parasite clearance.

">Classifying Resting State Connectivity: Lag-One Autocorrelation and Pattern Differentiability</a></h4>

              
                Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and resting state effective connectivity (rsEC) are two of the most common measures that can be extracted from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. RSFC is often used to indicate the statistical dependencies among different brain regions of interest, whereas rsEC describes the causal influences among them. Many studies have explored utilities of rsFC and rsEC measures for classifying psychiatric conditions. Several studies showed that rsEC were better than rsFC features for classifying major depression (Frassle et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2018) and schizophrenia ((Brodersen et al., 2014)). However, no study to-date has investigated whether rsEC is inherently better than rsFC for classifying psychiatric conditions or the impact of autocorrelation on classifying rsFC, even though autocorrelation is known to be present in rs-fMRI data. To fill these gaps, we performed a series of computational experiments, by varying the size of the network and the number of participants, to gain some insight into these two aspects of supervised classification with resting state connectivity. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, the results from our study suggest that rsEC cannot be, in principle, better than rsFC features for classification. In fact, rsEC measures led to systematically worse classification results, compared to rsFC features. In terms of the impact of autocorrelation, we found that lag-one autocorrelation could lead to both false negative and false positive classification results for studies with a small sample size.

">Enhancing Functional Connectivity Analysis in Task-Based fMRI Using the BOLD-Filter Method: Greater Network and Activation Voxel Sensitivities</a></h4>

              
                Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) has gained prominence for investigating brain connectivity by engaging specific functional networks during cognitive or behavioral tasks. Compared to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), tb-fMRI provides greater specificity and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for examining task-relevant networks and individual differences in brain function. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the BOLD-filter-a method originally developed to extract reliable BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) components from rs-fMRI-by applying it to tb-fMRI data as a preprocessing step for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The goal was to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of detecting task-induced functional activity. Compared to the conventional preprocessing method, the BOLD-filter substantially improved the isolation of task-evoked BOLD signals. It identified over eleven times more activation voxels at a high statistical threshold and more than twice as many at a lower threshold. Moreover, FC networks derived from BOLD-filtered signals revealed clearer task-related patterns, including gender-specific differences in brain regions linked to everyday behaviors. These patterns were not detectable using standard preprocessing approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the BOLD-filter enhances the robustness and interpretability of FC analysis in tb-fMRI. By effectively isolating meaningful functional networks, this approach offers significant advantages over conventional preprocessing methods. The BOLD-filter holds promise for advancing both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications by enabling more precise characterization of task-induced brain activity.

">A genetic driver of epileptic encephalopathy impairs gating of synaptic glycolysis</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a disproportionately large consumer of fuel, estimated to expend ~20% of the whole-body energy budget, and therefore it is critical to adequately control brain fuel expenditures while satisfying its on-demand needs for continued function. The brain is also metabolically vulnerable as the inability to adequately fuel cellular processes that support information transfer between cells leads to rapid neurological impairment. We show here that a genetic driver of early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE), SLC13A5, a Na+/citrate cotransporter (NaCT), is critical for gating the activation of local presynaptic glycolysis. We show that SLC13A5 is in part localized to a presynaptic pool of membrane-bound organelles and acts to transiently clear axonal citrate during electrical activity, in turn activating phosphofructokinase 1. We show that loss of SLC13A5 or mistargeting to the plasma membrane results in suppressed glycolytic gating, activity dependent presynaptic bioenergetic deficits and synapse dysfunction.

">High-speed whole-brain imaging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in brain-wide recordings of small animals such as worms, fish, and flies have revealed complex activity involving large populations of neurons. In the Drosophila brain, with about 140,000 neurons, brain-wide recordings have been critical to uncovering widespread sensory and motor activity. However, current limitations in volumetric imaging rates hinder the accurate capture of fast neural dynamics. To improve the speed of volumetric imaging in Drosophila, we leverage the recently introduced light beads microscopy (LBM) method. We built a microscope and a LBM module tailored to fly brain experiments and used it to record brain-wide calcium signals in adult behaving flies at 28 volumes per second and at 60 volumes per second when selecting the central brain alone. We uncover fast-timescale auditory responses that are missed with standard volumetric imaging. We also demonstrate how temporal super-resolution can be combined with LBM data to uncover responses to single Drosophila courtship song pulses. This establishes LBM as a viable tool for capturing whole-brain activity at high spatial and temporal resolution in the fly.

">A model investigation of short-term synaptic plasticity tuned via Unc13 isoforms.</a></h4>

              
                Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is a fundamental mechanism of neural computation supporting a variety of nervous system functions from sensory adaptation and gain control to working memory and decision making. At the presynaptic release site, an interplay between distinct (M)Unc13 protein isoforms is suggested to orchestrate depressing and facilitating components of STP. In this study, we introduce a modification of the well-established Tsodyks-Markram Model (TMM) for STP. We constrain our model by in vivo intracellular recordings in the olfactory system of the fruit fly, where previous work suggested Unc13A to provide a phasic, depressing and Unc13B a tonic, facilitating release component. A combination of a facilitating and a depressing model component indeed allowed for accurate model fits. Differential knock-down experiments of the Unc13A and Unc13B gene variants provide biological model interpretation, linking the protein-specific molecular mechanisms to synaptic function and STP. Our mathematical formulation of protein-dependent STP can be readily and efficiently used to design biologically realistic spiking neural network models that feature different genetically defined synapse types.

">Resolving synaptic events using subsynaptically targeted GCaMP8 variants</a></h4>

              
                While genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators are valuable for visualizing neural activity, their speed and sensitivity have had limited performance when compared to chemical dyes and electrophysiology, particularly at synaptic compartments. We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, CaFire, which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca2+ signals. Using CaFire, we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca2+ changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca2+ dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Decision-making is typically influenced by past choices. Previous studies have shown that the activity of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is involved in reward value coding, can be modulated by the reward values of previously chosen options. To further explore how the OFC processes the history of choice-related factors (HCF) from past choices, we analyzed the neuronal activity recorded in the monkey OFC during a decision-making task in which the monkeys could choose between two options based on their reward values. We found that the activity of over 70% of neurons was better explained by models that incorporated HCF than by models without it. The activity of these neurons during current choice was influenced by HCF in the previous trial. Additionally, some types of HCF were represented in these neurons between trials, suggesting that this information was maintained in the OFC and used to guide future decisions. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in the choice reaction times between trials sorted by HCF. Pharmacological inactivation of the OFC by muscimol infusion eliminated such behavioral differences. These results indicate that HCF-modulated OFC activity contributes to the behavioral bias during current decision-making.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study explores how the morphology of the left occipito-temporal sulcus and anterior cingulate cortex relates to reading and writing abilities. The occipito-temporal sulcus, which houses the visual word form area (VWFA), and the anterior cingulate cortex, involved in cognitive control, are key regions for literacy. Structural MRI scans from 38 children (aged 8 to 11) and 23 adults (aged 20 to 40) were analyzed to identify their sulcal patterns. Reading and writing (spelling and graphomotor) performance was assessed using standardized tests indexing both accuracy and speed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the left posterior occipito-temporal sulcus was associated with reading scores in both children and adults, and with graphomotor scores in children only. The anterior occipito-temporal sulcus and right hemisphere occipito-temporal sulcus also contributed to reading and writing outcomes. Anterior cingulate cortex asymmetry was linked to graphomotor performance in both age groups, highlighting its role in writing development. Since sulcal patterns are established prenatally and remain stable over time, the findings suggest that differences in literacy may partly originate from early brain development, alongside the neuroplastic effects of education and socioeconomic factors. This research underscores the interplay between early brain development, literacy, and the neuroplasticity shaped by learning experiences throughout life.</span>

                <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the central circadian clock in mammals, coordinating daily rhythms in both behavior and physiology. In the SCN, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-producing neurons (GRPNs) are predominantly located in the core region, suggesting their possible involvement in photic entrainment. However, the specific contribution of GRPNs to the regulation of circadian rhythms remains poorly understood. This study utilized a Cre-driver mouse line, <I>Grp-iCre</I> knock-in (KI) mice, in which Cre recombinase is exclusively expressed in GRPNs, allowing the selective manipulation of SCN GRPNs to investigate their characteristics and functional roles in circadian regulation. All experiments were conducted in adult male mice. Anatomical tracing revealed that SCN GRPNs primarily project to the thalamus and hypothalamus, whereas input mapping demonstrated that SCN GRPNs receive most synaptic inputs from within the SCN. Behavioral analyses revealed that neither GRP deficiency nor ablation of SCN GRPNs significantly affected circadian locomotor activity rhythms or photic entrainment. However, chemogenetic stimulation of the SCN GRPNs is sufficient to induce phase shifts in behavioral rhythms. Additionally, calcium imaging with fiber photometry indicated that SCN GRPNs quickly responded to photic stimulation, with increased neural activity following retinal exposure to white light. These findings suggest that SCN GRPNs play a role in photic entrainment, albeit potentially redundant with other neuronal populations such as vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing neurons.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are intermittent, fast synchronous oscillations that play a pivotal role in memory formation. It has been well established that SWRs occur during "consummatory behaviors," e.g., eating or drinking a reward for correct action. However, most of typical behavioral experiments using freely moving rodents have not rigorously distinguished between the act of eating/drinking (regardless of consummation or consumption) from stopping locomotion (immobility). Therefore, in this study, we investigated the occurrence of SWRs during a reward-seeking action and subsequent consummatory reward licking in constantly immobile rats (male and female) maintained under head fixation and body covering. Immobile rats performed a pedal hold&ndash;release action that was rewarded with water every other time (false and true consummation). Unexpectedly, the SWRs remarkably decreased during reward licking as well as pedal release action. Untrained rats also showed a similar SWR decrease during water licking. Conversely, SWRs gradually increased during the pedal hold period, which was enhanced by reward expectation. A cluster of hippocampal neurons responded to cue/pedal release and reward, as previously shown. Some other clusters exhibited spike activity changes similar to the SWR occurrence, i.e., decreasing during the pedal release action and reward licking, and enhanced by reward expectation during pedal hold period. These task event-responsive neurons and SWR-like neurons displayed stronger spiking synchrony with SWRs than task-unrelated neurons. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates SWRs, which may associate action with outcome, in "relative immobility" (action pauses) rather than specific consummation or consumption.</p>

                <p>Dynorphin (DYN)/-opioid receptor (KOR) activation contributes to aversion, dysphoria, sedation, depression, and enhanced psychostimulant-rewarding effects by inhibiting dopamine (DA) release. The precise neuronal mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear, limiting the use of KOR agonists in treating mood and substance use disorders. DYN fibers form synapses with DA terminals that express KOR and dopamine transporter (DAT), which is crucial for regulating DA dynamics and related behaviors. Previously, we demonstrated that KOR agonists upregulate DAT activity via ERK1/2 signaling involving phospho-Thr53 DAT (pT53-DAT). However, it remains unclear whether pT53-DAT is involved in KOR-mediated DAT regulation in vivo and whether such a phenomenon contributes to the behavioral effects of KOR agonism. In this study, we utilized male DAT-Ala53 knock-in mice with nonphosphorylatable Ala at position 53 to investigate the role of pT53-DAT in KOR-mediated DAT regulation and its behavioral effects. KOR agonist U69593 increased KOR antagonist-sensitive DAT activity, DAT <I>V</I><SUB>max</SUB>, pT53-DAT, and surface expression in WT but not in DAT-Ala53 mice. KOR agonists caused locomotor suppression, conditioned place aversion (CPA), and enhanced cocaine preference [conditioned place preference (CPP)] in WT but not in DAT-Ala53 mice. Conversely, both WT and DAT-Ala53 mice exhibited similar lithium chloride-induced CPA and morphine-induced CPP. These findings provide the first causal evidence that KOR-mediated locomotor suppression, aversive response, and enhancement of cocaine reward manifest through the modulation of DAT activity via DAT-Thr53 phosphorylation. This suggests that targeting specific DAT-regulatory motif(s) may help develop new KOR-directed therapeutic strategies devoid of adverse effects.</p>

                <p>Spatial frequency (SF) selectivity serves as a fundamental building block within the visual system, determining what we can and cannot see. Attention is theorized to augment the visibility of items in our environment by changing how we process SFs. However, the specific neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear, particularly in humans. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure voxel-wise population SF tuning (pSFT), which allowed us to examine how attention alters the SF response profiles of neural populations in the early visual cortex (V1&ndash;V3). In the scanner, participants (five female, three male) were cued to covertly attend to one of two spatially competing letter streams, each defined by low or high SF content. This task promoted feature-based attention directed to a particular SF, as well as the suppression of the irrelevant stream's SF. Concurrently, we measured pSFT in a task-irrelevant hemifield to examine how the known spatial spread of feature-based attention influenced the SF tuning properties of neurons sampled within a voxel. We discovered that attention elicited attractive shifts in SF preference, toward the attended SF. This suggests that attention can profoundly influence populations of SF preference across the visual field, depending on task goals and native neural preferences.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e0798242025?rss=1">Heterogeneous Effects of Cognitive Arousal on the Contrast Response in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>While animal studies have found that arousal states modulate visual responses, direct evidence for effects of arousal on human vision remains limited. Here, we used fMRI to examine effects of cognitive arousal on the gain of contrast response functions (CRFs) in human visual cortex. To measure CRFs, we measured BOLD responses in early visual cortex (V1&ndash;V3) while participants (<I>n</I> = 20, 14 females and 6 males) viewed stimuli that parametrically varied in contrast. To induce different cognitive arousal states, participants solved auditory arithmetic problems categorized as either Easy (low arousal) or Hard (high arousal). We found diversity in the modulatory effects across individuals: some individuals exhibited enhanced neural response with increased arousal, whereas others exhibited the opposite effect&mdash;a decrease in response with increased arousal. The pattern of overall BOLD modulation showed within-individual stability and was correlated with the degree of arousal-driven change in pupil size. Individuals who exhibited larger increases in pupil size with the arousal manipulation tended to show greater arousal-related decreases in visuocortical responses. We speculate that the polarity of the modulatory effect by cognitive arousal may relate to individual differences in cognitive effort expended in the high-difficulty condition, with individuals reaching different points on an underlying non-monotonic function.</p>

                <p>Neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb (OB) drives coordinated activity in the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network during early development. Inhibiting OB output in neonatal mice disrupts functional development of the hippocampal formation as well as cognitive abilities. These impairments manifest early in life and resemble dysfunctions of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex that have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we investigated OB activity during early development in a disease mouse model and asked whether activity disruptions might contribute to the dysfunctional development of the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network. We addressed this question by combining in vivo electrophysiology with behavioral assessment of immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice of both sexes that mimic the dual genetic&ndash;environmental etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In wild-type mice, we found high DISC1 expression levels in OB projection neurons during development. Furthermore, neuronal and network activity in the OB and the drive from the bulb to the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network were reduced in immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice during early development. This early deficit did not affect odor-evoked activity and odor perception but resulted in impaired long-term odor memory. We propose that reduced spontaneous activity in the developing OB might contribute to altered maturation of the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network, leading to memory impairment in immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1087242025?rss=1">The Molecular Substrates of Second-Order Conditioned Fear in the Basolateral Amygdala Complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rats quickly learn to fear a stimulus (e.g., a light) that signals brief but painful footshock. The consolidation of this first-order conditioned fear requires transcription and translation of specific genes in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Rats also learn to fear the associates of first-order conditioned stimuli, such as a sound paired with the already-conditioned light. The consolidation of this second-order conditioned fear also requires transcriptional processes in the BLA, but unlike consolidation of first-order fear, it is unaffected by BLA infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Accordingly, this study sought to identify genes/pathways that regulate second-order conditioned fear in male rats. It focused on the involvement of immediate early genes, as these can be transcribed in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. In Experiment 1, we used a principal components analysis of PCR data and found that second-order fear conditioning involves region- and time-specific changes in a network of genes including the immediate early genes <I>bdnf</I> and <I>egr1</I>. In Experiments 2&ndash;4, we used BLA infusions of antisense oligonucleotides and found that <I>bdnf</I> is required for consolidation of both first- and second-order fears but is not required for reconsolidation of either and <I>egr1</I> is not required for consolidation of first-order fear but is required for acquisition of second-order fear and reconsolidation of both types of fear. Hence, <I>bdnf</I> and <I>egr1</I> regulate different aspects of first- and second-order fear conditioning in the BLA. These findings are discussed with respect to novel forms of information processing in the mammalian brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1447242025?rss=1">The Functional Anatomy of Nociception: Effective Connectivity in Chronic Pain and Placebo Response</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic pain presents a widespread and complex clinical puzzle, necessitating theoretical approaches. This study expands upon our evolving comprehension of the brain&rsquo;s top-down information processing, encompassing functions such as prediction, expectation, and attention. These processes are believed to play a substantial role in shaping both chronic pain and placebo responses. To examine hierarchical cortical processing in pain, we define a minimal cortical pain network comprising the lateral frontal pole, the primary somatosensory cortex, and posterior insula. Using spectral dynamic causal modeling on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we compare effective connectivity among these regions in chronic osteoarthritic patients (<I>n</I> = 54) and healthy controls (<I>n</I> = 18), and further analyze differences in placebo responders and non-responders within the patient group. Our findings reveal distinct patterns of altered top-down, bottom-up, and recurrent (i.e., intrinsic)  effective connectivity within the network in chronic pain and placebo response. Specifically, recurrent connectivity within the lateral frontal pole becomes more inhibitory, while backward connectivity (higher-to-lower cortical regions) decreases in both pain perceivers and placebo responders. Conversely, forward connections show opposite patterns: nociception is associated with more excitatory (disinhibited) connections, whereas placebo responses correspond to more inhibitory forward connections. The associated effect sizes were sufficiently large to survive a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of predictive validity. The observed alterations are consistent with predictive processing accounts of placebo effects and chronic pain. Overall, effective extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity among cortical regions involved in pain processing emerge as potentially valuable and quantifiable markers of pain perception and placebo response.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1488242025?rss=1">Complex Impact of Stimulus Envelope on Motor Synchronization to Sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human brain tracks temporal regularities in acoustic signals faithfully. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown complex modulations of synchronized neural activities to the shape of stimulus envelopes. How to connect neural responses to different envelope shapes with listeners&rsquo; perceptual ability to synchronize to acoustic rhythms requires further characterization. Here, we examine motor and sensory synchronization to noise stimuli with periodic amplitude modulations (AM) in human participants (14 females, 10 males). We used three envelope shapes that varied in the sharpness of amplitude onset. In a synchronous motor finger-tapping task, we show that participants more consistently align their taps to the same phase of stimulus envelope when listening to stimuli with sharp onsets than to those with gradual onsets. This effect is replicated in a sensory synchronization task, suggesting a sensory basis for the facilitated phase alignment to sharp-onset stimuli. Surprisingly, despite less consistent tap alignments to the envelope of gradual-onset stimuli, participants are equally effective in extracting the rate of amplitude modulation from both sharp and gradual-onset stimuli, and they tapped consistently at that rate alongside the acoustic input. This result demonstrates that robust tracking of the rate of acoustic periodicity is achievable without the presence of sharp acoustic edges or consistent phase alignment to stimulus envelope. Our findings are consistent with assuming distinct processes for phase and rate tracking during sensorimotor synchronization. These processes are most likely underpinned by different neural mechanisms whose relative strengths are modulated by specific temporal dynamics of stimulus envelope characteristics.</p>

                <p>Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in the human brain has been inferred through somatic retroinsertion/retrotransposition events; however, actual endogenous enzymatic activities and sources remain unclear. L1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons bicistronically express ORF2, containing RT and endonuclease (EN) domains, and RNA-binding protein ORF1, together enabling L1 retrotransposition and contributing to somatic genomic mosaicism. Here, we assessed endogenous RT activities and L1 mRNA diversity from cerebral cortex samples of 31 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nondiseased (ND) brains (both sexes) using enzymatic functional assays, targeted PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, and quantitative spatial transcriptomics. Expected bicistronic, full-length L1 transcripts were absent from most samples, constituting &lt;0.01% of L1 sequences, of which &gt;80% were noncoding. Monocistronic ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts were identified across all samples, consistent with quantitative spatial transcriptomics that identified discordant ORF2 and ORF1 expression in neurons. All brains had RT activity, with AD samples showing less activity, consistent with neuronal loss of terminal AD versus aged ND donors. Brain RT activity was higher in the gray matter and correlated with increased neuronal ORF2 expression, further supporting neuronal contributions. Remarkably, &gt;550 protein-encoding, poly(A<sup>+</sup>) ORF2 sequence variants were identified, over two times more than identified in the human reference genome (hg38). Experimental overexpression of full-length and truncated ORF2 variants revealed ~50-fold RT and ~1.3-fold EN activity ranges, supporting endogenous functional capacity of monocistronic ORF2 variants in the human brain. The vast sequence diversity of monocistronic ORF2 mRNAs could underlie functional differences in RT-mediated somatic gene recombination/retroinsertion and resulting genomic mosaicism in the normal and diseased brain.</p>

                <p>This study examined how amyloid burden affects structural and functional brain network topology in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a risk condition for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Functional and structural brain networks were analyzed in 100 individuals with SCD and 86 normal controls (NC; both sexes included) using resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. Topological properties of brain networks were evaluated as indicators of information exchange efficiency and network robustness. Amyloid burden in 55 SCD participants was measured using amyloid PET imaging and a frequency-based staging method, which defined global and regional amyloid burden for four anatomical stages. Compared with NC, individuals with SCD exhibited increased functional nodal efficiency and structural nodal betweenness in the left anterior and median cingulate gyri, with no differences in network-level properties. Amyloid staging revealed four cortical divisions: Stage 1, fusiform and lateral temporal gyri; Stage 2, occipital areas; Stage 3, default mode network (DMN), midline brain, and lateral frontotemporal areas; and Stage 4, the remaining cortex. The global and regional amyloid burdens of each cortical stage were positively associated with the node-level properties of a set of DMN hubs, with the left anterior and posterior cingulate gyri being congruently associated with all amyloid stages. These findings suggest that amyloid burden continuously influences network adaptations through DMN hubs, irrespective of local proximity to pathology. Increased nodal properties in cortical hubs may reflect heightened information-processing demands during early amyloid deposition in this population at risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Self-related representation can enhance perception and memory&mdash;a phenomenon known as the self-referential effect (SRE). While SRE has been linked to the activation of the default mode network (DMN), including the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (Pcu/PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the underlying neurochemical processes of DMN activations remain unclear. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within brain circuits is crucial for cognition and may play a role in the SRE. We examine whether the ratio of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) to -aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations, measured by <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) as a proxy measure for E/I balance, is associated with DMN neural processes involved in self-referential encoding. Fifty-four healthy participants aged 7&ndash;35 (25 female) underwent MRS to measure levels of Glx and GABA in Pcu/PCC and completed an fMRI scan during an encoding task that involved self-referential and semantic judgments. We found that the self-related condition led to better subsequent memory and greater activation in the Pcu/PCC compared with the semantic condition. Activations in the Pcu/PCC were positively correlated with the Glx/GABA+ ratio. Task-dependent functional connectivity analysis revealed that connectivity between the Pcu/PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was positively associated with both the Glx/GABA+ ratio and the SRE effect on recollection accuracy. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that a higher Glx/GABA+ ratio correlated with better SRE on memory recollection through increased Pcu/PCC&ndash;mPFC connectivity. Our study provides valuable insights into how neurochemical activity is associated with self-related cognition via functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks.</p>

                <p>Glymphatic transport in rodents has primarily been studied using cisterna magna cannulation (CMC), a minimally invasive method for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracers infusion. However, CMC is suboptimal due to the lack of bony structures to stabilize the cannula, leading to potential movement artifacts. Here, we present an alternative approach involving chronic cannulation of the lateral ventricles of mice for CSF tracer delivery. A direct comparison demonstrated that intraventricular cannulation (IVC) reproduces CMC results in vivo, including perivascular labeling of the middle cerebral artery, which was further confirmed by ex vivo analysis. IVC enables tracer infusion in awake mice, facilitating glymphatic transport studies in conjunction with behavioral assessments that were previously unattainable. Additionally, IVC supports repeated infusions in awake animals, offering the potential to reduce the number of experimental animals required. This study establishes IVC as a robust alternative for studying glymphatic transport and associated physiological processes.</p>

This variability complicates the use of antibody levels as a correlate of protection and the evaluation of population- and individual-level infection risk without access to broad serological testing. Here, we applied a mathematical model of antibody kinetics to capture individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody trajectories and to identify factors driving the humoral immune response. Subsequently, we evaluated model predictions and inferred the corresponding duration of protection for new individuals based on a single antibody measurement, assuming sparse access to serological testing. We observe a reduced antibody response in older and in male individuals, and in individuals with autoimmune diseases, diabetes and immunosuppression, using data from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in healthcare workers at Sheba Medical Center, Israel, following primary vaccination with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Our results further suggest that model predictions of an individual’s antibody response to vaccination can be used to predict the duration of protection when serological data is limited, highlighting the potential of our approach to estimate infection risk over time on both the population and individual level to support public health decision-making in future pandemics.

                <p>by Matteo Priorelli, Ivilin Peev Stoianov, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>

Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This <i>decide-then-act</i> perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions—called <i>embodied decisions</i>—that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to “change mind” between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference—a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings – namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.

                <p>by Amit Yaron, Tomoyo Shiramatsu-Isoguchi, Felix B. Kern, Kenichi Ohki, Hirokazu Takahashi, Zenas C. Chao</p>

Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

                <p>by Ling S. Loh, Joseph J. Hanly, Alexander Carter, Martik Chatterjee, Martina Tsimba, Donya N. Shodja, Luca Livraghi, Christopher R. Day, Robert D. Reed, W. Owen McMillan, Gregory A. Wray, Arnaud Martin</p>

The evolution of sexual secondary characteristics necessitates regulatory factors that confer sexual identity to differentiating tissues and cells. In <i>Colias eurytheme</i> butterflies, males exhibit two specialized wing scale types—ultraviolet-iridescent (UVI) and spatulate scales—which are absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and single-nucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development. We show that <i>Doublesex</i> (<i>Dsx</i>) expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the UVI cell state in females, while unexpectedly, UVI activation in males is independent from <i>Dsx</i>. In the melanic marginal band, <i>Dsx</i> is required in each sex to enforce the presence of spatulate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UVI and spatulate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion. Both male-specific cell types share a low expression of the <i>Bric-a-brac</i> (<i>Bab</i>) transcription factor, a key repressor of the UVI fate. Bab ChIP-seq profiling suggests that Bab binds the <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions of gene markers associated to UVI fate, including potential effector genes involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal processes and chitin secretion, and loci showing signatures of recent selective sweeps in a UVI-polymorphic population. These findings open new avenues for exploring wing patterning and scale development, shedding light on the mechanisms driving the specification of sex-specific cell states and the differentiation of specialized cell ultrastructures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-598/v1?src=rss">Anticipated Growth in Healthcare Spending: The Role of Thailand’s Comprehensive Health Awareness Policy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Thailand’s health awareness policy embodies a comprehensive, multi-sectoral strategy aimed at enhancing national health literacy and fostering sustainable public health outcomes. Central to this initiative is the empowerment of individuals through education and resources that encourage healthier lifestyles, disease prevention, and a reduction in the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This foundational emphasis reflects the government’s belief that well-informed citizens are the cornerstone of a resilient and effective public health system. Methods The forecasting method for Thailand’s GDP and healthcare spending uses quantitative modeling and scenario analysis, integrating macroeconomic indicators and sector-specific variables. For GDP forecasting, the method applies time-series econometric models, such as ARIMA, with inputs including export performance, domestic consumption, investment trends, and government spending. These models are calibrated using historical data from sources such as the Bank of Thailand and the National Economic and Social Development Council. Healthcare spending forecasts extend these projections by adding demographic data—especially population age structure—along with epidemiological trends, healthcare utilization rates, government healthcare policies, and medical technology advancements. Results A key component of this forecasting involves estimating fiscal pressures by the aging population and rising chronic disease prevalence, increasing demand for long-term care and advanced medical services. Projections consider investments in infrastructure, workforce, and digital health, affecting cost and efficiency. Scenario-based approaches assess policy or economic impacts on future GDP and healthcare spending. This integrated method supports forward-looking, evidence-based policy and resource allocation in economic and healthcare sectors. Conclusions Ultimately, Thailand’s health awareness policy aspires to build a well-informed, health-conscious population capable of making proactive choices that enhance well-being and reduce reliance on healthcare services. Through a sustained focus on prevention, education, and inclusivity, the policy aims to strengthen the resilience of the nation’s healthcare system, promote equity in health outcomes, and ensure long-term public health sustainability.

                Background Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome commonly associated with solid organ malignancies like squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, head & neck, as well as breast, ovarian, renal, and bladder carcinomas and hematological malignancies like Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL). However, its occurrence in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is rare, with the majority of reported cases linked to pancreatic NETs. Here, we describe an extremely rare case of a metastatic duodenal NET presenting with severe hypercalcemia due to the secretion of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP). This case features an exceptionally high PTHrP level, placing it among the most severe reported cases of NET-associated HHM. Case Presentation A 70-year-old male with known metastatic duodenal NET (grade 2, Ki67 index: 18.2%) presented with unresponsiveness. Despite previous distal gastrectomy with D1 duodenal resection, Octreotide Long-Acting Release (LAR), Everolimus, and four cycles of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), disease progression was evident on Gallium- 68 DOTANOC PET/CT scan. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe hypercalcemia (corrected calcium: 14.06 mg/dL) with suppressed iPTH levels (Intact Parathyroid Hormone) and markedly elevated PTHrP levels of 252 pmol/L (Parathyroid Hormone related Peptide), thereby confirming HHM. Multiple myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis were excluded by appropriate testing. Despite aggressive management with intravenous fluids, calcitonin, ibandronate, and multiple hemodialysis sessions, the patient succumbed to hypoxic brain injury. Discussion HHM is rarely seen in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and is most commonly associated with pancreatic NETs; we report a rare case of metastatic duodenal NET causing severe hypercalcemia due to excessive PTHrP production. With a remarkably elevated PTHrP level, this case is among the most severe documented cases of NET-associated HHM. The relationship between tumor grade and PTHrP production, along with the refractory nature of the hypercalcemia despite standard interventions, highlights the complex pathophysiology of this condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1344/v2?src=rss">Migration, Urbanism and Health: Moving Toward Systems-Informed Policy and Practice [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Migration and displacement are pivotal determinants of urban health, influencing both direct and indirect health outcomes. Migrants may face unique health risks, often exacerbated by economic, social, and environmental factors encountered during transit or upon resettlement. As migration patterns shift due to geopolitical, climatic, and economic pressures, they reshape the global and urban policy landscapes in unpredictable ways, presenting challenges that will continue to evolve in the coming decades. Many current legal frameworks do not adequately account for migrant populations, hindering effective policy responses. Therefore, effective urban health interventions must be inclusive of migrant populations and expand beyond healthcare services. A systems-thinking approach that recognizes the broader determinants of health—including housing, employment, social services, and urban infrastructure—is essential to address the intersecting challenges migrants face. Despite these challenges, migration remains crucial to the functioning of urban environments. Migrant workers consistently contribute to the healthy operation of cities, underpinning key infrastructure and services. However, to optimize policy responses and improve urban health outcomes, more robust data and evidence on the health risks and outcomes of migrants, as well as the structural drivers of migration, are needed. Moreover, macro factors such as climate change, future pandemics, and geopolitical shifts are likely to influence both migration dynamics and migrant health. This paper explores links between migration and urban health and identifies implications for policy and practice. It draws from a qualitative review of policy documents, academic literature, and illustrative examples from selected urban contexts. The paper calls for integrated, equity-oriented strategies that consider the structural and social determinants shaping migrant health. A systems-informed and holistic vision of urban health is required to integrate migration into the broader urban policy and planning frameworks to foster healthier, more resilient cities.

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by α-synuclein aggregation in neurons. Recent advances suggest α-synuclein aggregates could serve as a biomarker for PD and related synucleinopathies. This study used surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) to measure α-synuclein aggregates in urine. Patients with PD and isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a precursor to PD, had elevated concentrations compared with healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 65% for PD versus controls and 89% and 62% for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder versus controls. The findings highlight sFIDA's potential for diagnosing synucleinopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:147–151</p>

                <p>Self-limited epilepsies of childhood are common and were considered benign. We aim to determine whether cognitive function in young adults who experienced epilepsy as children and are subsequently seizure-free and unmedicated differ from the general population. We report on a cross-sectional population-based study including 2,124,871 men and women aged 16–19 years. Participants &gt; 5 years following the last seizure and &gt; 2 years without anti-seizure medication (n = 3,452) had an odds ratio (OR) of having low cognitive function of 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24–1.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) using a multinominal regression model. Our results underscore the need to avoid the term “benign” in the classification of childhood epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:62–66</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27205?af=R">Distinct Alterations of Inflammatory Biomarkers in Cluster Headache: A Case Control Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Investigate the immune system's role in cluster headache by analyzing cytokines in people with cluster headache and headache-free controls, and explore if certain cytokines could predict a specific phenotype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured 45 cytokines in adult participants from the Danish Cluster Headache Biobank in a prospective case–control setup. People with cluster headache were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders third-edition. Controls were matched for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 412 were analyzed deriving from 99 with chronic cluster headache, 108 with episodic cluster headache (ECH) in bout, 105 with ECH in remission, and 100 successfully matched controls. Compared with controls, 13 cytokines were altered for ECH in bout (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), 3 in remission (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and 10 for chronic cluster headache (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Oncostatin m was significantly elevated in all 3 disease states compared with controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Overall, the investigated cytokines showed distinct patterns of alterations between chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache in bout and, interestingly, IL-1β was significantly associated with having chronic cluster headache rather than episodic in bout in a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Findings show that the immune system is altered in all 3 states of cluster headache compared with controls. Oncostatin m was elevated, constituting a promising target for future studies. The distinct alterations between episodic and chronic cluster headache are striking and urges further research of the immune system in cluster headache to better understand its potential role in prediction of disease activity and treatment response.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We analyzed the genotypic and phenotypic features of patients with psychosis of epilepsy (POE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with POE recruited to an epilepsy genetics research program underwent phenotyping and genetic analysis. The latter included screening for rare pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes, and polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation for common risk variants associated with schizophrenia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred twenty-two individuals with POE were identified. Eighty-six of 122 of the individuals (70%) had interictal psychosis, with schizophrenia the most common interictal phenotype (36/86, 42%). Twenty-eight of 122 of the individuals (23%) had postictal psychosis (PIP), 2 of 122 of the individuals (2%) had antiseizure medication-induced psychosis, and 6 of 122 of the individuals (5%) had substance-induced psychosis. Focal epilepsies were more frequently associated with PIP (24/28, 86%) compared to interictal psychosis (39/86, 45%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with POE with genetic data had a rare pathogenic variant: 19 in an epilepsy gene (<i>PCDH19</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>KCNT1</i>, <i>CHD2</i>, <i>SLC2A1</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>CLN3</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>, and <i>CACNA1A</i>) and 4 had a chromosomal anomaly. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with a rare pathogenic variant had interictal schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder rather than PIP (9%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). PRSs showed that schizophrenia-related common risk variants were enriched in patients with POE compared to population controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0007), however, among the POE phenotypes, a raised PRS was only observed in interictal schizophrenia (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and not in those with PIP or other interictal POEs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Interictal POE is threefold more common than PIP, and more likely to be associated with both rare pathogenic variants for epilepsy and common risk variants for schizophrenia. Distinguishing between different POE phenotypes enhances clinical practice and our understanding of etiology, paving the way for precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:35–47</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the association between computed tomography perfusion (CTP) parameters and outcomes in basilar artery occlusion (BAO), and to select patients with BAO who may benefit from thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of patients from the ATTENTION trial with available admission CTP data. CTP parameters evaluated included time to maximum (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s/8 s/10 s, relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) &lt;20%/30%/34%/38%/50%, Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS), and CTP-posterior circulation acute stroke prognosis early computed tomography score (CTP-pc-ASPECTS), pons-midbrain-thalamus (PMT) hypoperfusion. Multivariable Firth logistic regression was used to analyze associations between CTP parameters and outcomes and to explore treatment interactions. The primary outcome was favorable outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–3, at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 109 patients (70 thrombectomy, 39 control). Multivariable analysis showed that lower CAPS, smaller rCBF &lt;34% volume, and higher CTP-pc-ASPECTS were associated with favorable outcome. Patients who underwent thrombectomy had a higher likelihood of favorable outcome with increasing CAPS (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt; 6 s) compared to control (<i>P</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.048 for continuous variable). When CAPS (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt; 6 s) was treated as a categorical variable, the interaction remained significant (<i>P</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.03). Similarly, the treatment effect was also modified by PMT hypoperfusion (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s) (<i>P</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.03). In patients with CAPS (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s) &gt;3 or with PMT hypoperfusion (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s), thrombectomy was associated with favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher CAPS correlated with a decrease in the rate of favorable outcomes. However, patients with higher CAPS were more likely to benefit from thrombectomy compared to medical management alone, suggesting that severe hypoperfusion should not preclude endovascular treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27216?af=R">Mapping Molecular Pathways of Multiple Sclerosis: A Gene Prioritization and Network Analysis of White Matter Pathology Transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid advances in transcriptomics have driven efforts to identify deregulated pathways in multiple sclerosis (MS) tissues, though many detected differentially expressed genes are likely false positives, with only a small fraction reflecting actual pathological events. Robust, integrative methods are essential for accurately understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MS pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a gene prioritization analysis of MS white matter pathology transcriptomic studies. Articles were sought in Scopus and PubMed up to July 31, 2024. Potentially eligible publications were those that provided either transcriptomics datasets (deposited in GEO) or lists of differentially expressed genes comparing MS white matter to control white matter.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Applying a vote-count strategy to search for the intersection of genes reported in multiple independent studies with a consistent fold-change direction, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, we identified 528 highly significant differentially expressed multi-study genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; 10,000 simulations). Functional enrichment analysis revealed deregulation of the folate pathway in MS normal-appearing white matter, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related and complement-related pathways in active and chronic active lesions, respectively. Network analysis identified 6 key signaling hubs: PTPRC, HLA-B, MYC, MMP2, COL11A2, MAG. The major nodes identified revealed mechanistic concordance with published in vivo MS models, supporting their value as potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our strategy provides a robust framework for integrating gene expression data, effectively identifying the intricate pathways altered in human diseased tissues. This method holds potential for translating findings into drug development strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:67–79</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27217?af=R">Cyclic Alternating Pattern Dynamics in Individuals at Risk for Developing Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) metrics, a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep physiological rhythm, among recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and individuals at high and low risk for developing PD based on genetic and prodromal risk.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cross-sectional exploratory study, participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and motor evaluation to compute risk based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) prodromal criteria and a standard overnight polysomnography. CAP rate, CAP index, A index subtypes, number of CAP sequences, and CAP sequence duration were computed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 30 patients with early PD (mean age = 62.80 ± 7.69, disease duration = 1.10 ± 1.09), 26 participants at risk for PD (age = 64.88 ± 10.09), and 36 participants with low risk for PD (age = 56.83 ± 7.41). Despite comparable macrosleep architecture, most CAP measures were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with the low-risk group, whereas the at-risk group showed transitional values between PD and the low-risk group. The A2 index was significantly lower in both the at-risk and PD groups from the low-risk group (at risk = 7.59 ± 4.59; PD = 7.71 ± 5.83; and low risk = 12.85 ± 8.63; <i>p</i> = 0.010). Lower CAP rate and lower CAP index were associated with greater disease severity (<i>r</i> = −0.23 and − 0.24, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with early clinical PD exhibit alterations in CAP dynamics despite having comparable macrosleep architecture. Alterations of the NREM microsleep structure may occur early in the neurodegenerative process and the A2 index may be an early event in the evolution of the disease with the potential to serve as an early marker for disease progression.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ofatumumab presents a potentially promising alternative to current second-line immunotherapy for refractory anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR-AE). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab as a novel second-line immunotherapy for NMDAR-AE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, multicenter, nested cohort study compared patients with NMDAR-AE from the CHina Autoimmune encephalitiS outcomE study registry (CHASE) recruited between October 2011 and February 2024, treated with and without ofatumumab. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching a favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≤2) at the last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included mRS scores and Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE) scores over the first 24-month follow-up and the proportion with further mRS score improvement after ofatumumab initiation. A propensity score matching was performed to balance major confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 715 patients with AE were screened. Fifty-eight propensity score-matched patients with NMDAR-AE each in the ofatumumab group and non-ofatumumab group were analyzed. Fifty-four patients (93.1%) in the ofatumumab group achieved further mRS score improvement with a median time of 14 days from ofatumumab initiation, and 53 (91.4%) reached a favorable functional outcome at the last follow-up. For those who failed first-line immunotherapy, the ofatumumab group demonstrated a faster mRS score and CASE score improvement and more frequently reached a favorable functional outcome at the last follow-up compared with the non-ofatumumab group (87.9% vs. 64.7%, odds ratio [OR] 3.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–13.94; <i>p</i> = 0.026). No serious adverse events associated with ofatumumab treatment were reported.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Ofatumumab showed substantial efficacy and safety, particularly in patients who failed first-line immunotherapy, warranting its consideration in NMDAR-AE management. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:80–92</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27222?af=R">Blood DDIT4 and TRIM13 Transcript Levels Mark the Early Stages of Machado–Joseph Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>An abundance of select transcripts and proteins has been found to be dysregulated in blood samples of Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) carriers. Here, we aimed to: (1) identify blood transcriptional changes as potential biomarkers of MJD; (2) correlate levels of differentially expressed blood transcripts with MJD carriers features; and (3) evaluate whether the identified differential abundance of blood transcripts in MJD patients is preserved in MJD brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used unbiased RNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess transcript levels in blood and brain samples, and western blot analysis to evaluate the abundance of specific proteins in brain samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed consistent dysregulation of <i>DDIT4</i>, <i>TRIM13</i>, and <i>P2RY13</i> transcriptional levels in the blood of MJD patients from preclinical to symptomatic stages in Azorean and Brazilian cohorts. Combined blood <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcriptional levels show a very high accuracy to discriminate MJD carriers from matched controls (AUC ≥0.90). Levels of <i>P2RY13</i> transcripts correlate with age at onset, and an abundance of <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcripts correlate with the expanded CAG repeat size in combined Azorean and Brazilian patients; and levels of <i>TRIM13</i> transcripts correlate with age at onset of early-stage Azorean patients. Moreover, the abundance of TRIM13 protein is increased in the cerebral cortex of MJD patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, blood <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcript levels are potential biomarkers of MJD. Cellular processes involving <i>DDIT4</i>, <i>TRIM13</i>, and <i>P2RY13</i> appear to be commonly dysregulated in the blood and brain of MJD patients, indicating the involvement of these genes in MJD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27223?af=R">Dopamine Transporter Imaging as Objective Monitoring Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27224?af=R">Network Localization of Pediatric Lesion‐Induced Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dystonia is a movement disorder defined by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures or twisting and repetitive movements. Classically dystonia has been thought of as a disorder of the basal ganglia, but newer results in idiopathic dystonia and lesion-induced dystonia in adults point to broader motor network dysfunction spanning the basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal regions. It is unclear whether a similar network is shared between different etiologies of pediatric lesion-induced dystonia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three cohorts of pediatric patients with lesion-induced dystonia were identified. The lesion etiologies included hypoxia, kernicterus, and stroke versus comparison subjects with acquired lesions not associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with dystonia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the putamen and globus pallidus were associated with dystonia (<i>r</i> = 0.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Lesion network mapping using normative connectome data from healthy children demonstrated that these regional findings occurred within a common brain-wide network that involves the basal ganglia, anterior and medial cerebellum, and cortical regions that overlap the cingulo-opercular action-mode and somato-cognitive-action networks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We interpret these findings as novel evidence for a unified dystonia brain network that involves the somato-cognitive-action network, which is implicated in the coordination of movement. Elucidation of this network gives insight into the functional origins of dystonia and provides novel targets to investigate for therapeutic intervention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:163–173</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel-aspirin versus aspirin alone in patients after ischemic stroke by glycemic status using data from the Intensive Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for Acute High-risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis (INSPIRES) trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with mild ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin alone. They were categorized into 3 subgroups according to glycemic status based on medical history and diagnosis by a clinician during hospitalization: without type 2 diabetes mellitus, with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were new stroke and moderate-to-severe bleeding risk within 90-day follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 6,100 patients were enrolled (3,050 in each arm), with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range [IQR], 57–71) and 2,185 female (35.8%). Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment was associated with a reduction in recurrent stroke compared with aspirin alone in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (6.3% vs 8.4%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59–0.94; <i>p</i> = 0.01) and those with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (5.8% vs 13.0%; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14–0.66; <i>p</i> = 0.002), but not in those with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (10.0% vs 9.9%; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72–1.33; <i>p</i> = 0.88) (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.03). Moderate-to-severe bleeding events did not differ significantly by treatment across glycemic subgroups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the INSPIRES trial, patients without or with type 2 diabetes mellitus derived greater benefit from clopidogrel-aspirin than those with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus after mild ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by altered metabolome and energy homeostasis, manifesting with body mass index changes and hypermetabolism—both prognostic of disease progression and survival. The cross-sectional ALS metabolome has been characterized, but longitudinal correlations to functional decline are lacking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally evaluated metabolomes from ALS plasma and terminal postmortem spinal cord and brain motor cortex tissue. We constructed 3 plasma models. A linear mixed effects model correlated all metabolite levels across all timepoints to their corresponding functional scores. An interaction model predicted a longitudinal change in function from baseline metabolites, whereas a progression model identified metabolites linked to a 20% or 50% drop in function. In postmortem samples, differential metabolites in onset versus second spinal cord segments served as a surrogate of disease progression. Mendelian randomization assessed potential causality from metabolites.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In plasma, all models primarily selected lipid metabolites and sub-pathways, in addition to amino acids, xenobiotics, and various less frequently selected pathways. Among lipids, fatty acids and sphingomyelins were predominant, along with plasmalogens, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophospholipids. Sex interaction findings were nominal. In the spinal cord, sphingomyelin and long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the onset segment tissue, whereas phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were less abundant. Mendelian randomization suggested that impaired carnitine and short chain acylcarnitine metabolism may be genetically determined in ALS, along with various antioxidant derivatives.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest metabolomic changes primarily involving different lipid classes and carnitine metabolism may underscore ALS severity and progression. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:19–34</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in <i>KCNT1</i> encoding for potassium channels are associated with different epilepsy phenotypes, including epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), other early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and focal epilepsy. Fluoxetine blocks currents from both wild-type (WT) and mutant KCNT1 channels with GoF in vitro features. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with fluoxetine might improve clinical outcome in patients with EIMFS carrying GoF variants in KCNT1 channels showing in vitro sensitivity to fluoxetine blockade.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled three pediatric patients carring de novo KCNT1 genetic variants linked to EIMFS. Functional and pharmacological studies to assess fluoxetine's ability to counteract in vitro variant-induced functional effects were performed with patch-clamp electrophysiology on heterologous channel expression in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. Neuropsychological assessment, electroencephalogram and seizure diary were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months during the study. Electrocardiography and blood levels of medications were monitored for safety.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All 3 <i>KCNT1</i> variants displayed GoF effects in vitro. Exposure to fluoxetine (10μM) blocked both WT and mutant KCNT1 channels, therefore, counteracting variant-induced functional effects. Treatment with fluoxetine caused a variable reduction of seizure frequency (25–75%). Improvement in visual attention, participation, and muscle tone was also reported. No adverse events were reported except for transient dyskinesia in 1 patient, which was probably related to an increase in fluoxetine plasma level.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fluoxetine may be a potential targeted medication in EIMFS caused by <i>KCNT1</i> GoF variants. Further research is needed to assess its long-term efficacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:48–61</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common cause of arboviral disease in the United States. Approximately 1% of infections involve the nervous system, most commonly resulting in West Nile encephalitis (WNE), West Nile meningitis (WNM), or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this systematic review, we characterized comprehensively the diagnostic and clinical features of WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) in the United States, as well as the evidence regarding prognostic factors and long-term outcomes of WNND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 47 relevant studies reporting data on acute or longitudinal features of WNND. Across studies, the most common presenting symptoms were fever (88%), nausea/vomiting (58%), and fatigue (50%) coupled neurologically with headache (50%), altered mental status (39%), and focal weakness (32%). Pooled mortality was 9.2%, and 42.1% of reported cases required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In meta-analyses, chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] = 5.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.71–13.23), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.54–3.84), and hypertension (OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 2.39–6.72) were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Multidomain neurocognitive impairment was reported in several studies at post-hospitalization follow-up, although with marked heterogeneity between study methodology. Subjective neurocognitive impairment, most notably fatigue (37–75%), memory concerns (11–57%), concentration deficits (17–48%), and depression (17–38%), were also common at post-hospitalization follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings underscore the significant mortality and morbidity of WNND in the acute and long-term setting. Our findings may additionally provide utility for risk stratification of hospitalized patients with WNND and suggest the need for further evaluation of novel therapeutics to prevent substantial disease-associated acute and long-term disability.

                In this issue of Neuron, Son et al. reveal how pathologic α-synuclein inhibits autophagy, leading to neurodegeneration. Their work highlights the key roles of the acetyl-CoA-producing enzyme ACLY and aberrant cytoplasmic p300 acetylation, uncovering new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease.

                Clusterin (CLU) is a recognized genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. In this issue of Neuron, Lish et al. found that lower CLU levels in astrocytes, caused by the CLU risk allele, heightened inflammation and reduced synaptic functions, potentially increasing risk for cognitive decline.

                In this issue of Neuron, Phillips et al. report that the thalamus encodes abstract rules, guides actions, and monitors outcomes—functions thought exclusive to the prefrontal cortex—highlighting the need to reconsider the role of thalamocortical interactions for cognitive control.

                Leptin regulates energy balance through the brain, yet its key neuronal targets remain unclear. Solheim et al. identify hypothalamic GABAergic PNOC/NPY neurons as mediators of leptin’s anorectic effects, advancing our understanding of neurocircuits linking adiposity signals to feeding control.

                Saleme et al. show that cancer’s stress resistance is driven by translation of hyperacute response proteins from m6A-tagged mRNAs within minutes of various stresses (metabolic stress, radiation, oxidative stress, or chemotherapy). Translation is mediated by cytosolic FTO activation by MARK4 on specialized γ-tubulin-associated ribosomes. FTO and MARK4 inhibitors are therapeutic targets for cancer’s resistance to stress.
