              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02799">Data-driven mean-field within whole-brain models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field models provide a link between microscopic neuronal activity and macroscopic brain dynamics. Their derivation depends on simplifying assumptions, such as all-to-all connectivity, limiting their biological realism. To overcome this, we introduce a data-driven framework in which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns the macroscopic dynamics directly from simulations of a network of spiking neurons. The network connection probability serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment, which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical model. For validation, we use simulation-based inference on synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate accurate parameter recovery for the novel mean-field model, while the current state-of-the-art models lead to biased estimates. This work presents a flexible and generic framework for building more realistic whole-brain models, bridging the gap between microscale mechanisms and macroscopic brain recordings.

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional, and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of 0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data analysis.

                arXiv:2504.00300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. This change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure.

                arXiv:2509.00116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds. Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across 15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in everyday life.

                arXiv:2509.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii) Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image transformations.

                arXiv:2406.14427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in advancing artificial intelligence is achieving the right balance between utility maximization and resource use by both external movement and internal computation. While this trade-off has been studied in fully observable settings, our understanding of resource efficiency in partially observable environments remains limited. Motivated by this challenge, we develop a version of the POMDP framework where the information gained through inference is treated as a resource that must be optimized alongside task performance and motion effort. By solving this problem in environments described by linear-Gaussian dynamics, we uncover fundamental principles of resource efficiency. Our study reveals a phase transition in the inference, switching from a Bayes-optimal approach to one that strategically leaves some uncertainty unresolved. This frugal behavior gives rise to a structured family of equally effective strategies, facilitating adaptation to later objectives and constraints overlooked during the original optimization. We illustrate the applicability of our framework and the generality of the principles we derived using two nonlinear tasks. Overall, this work provides a foundation for a new type of rational computation that both brains and machines could use for effective but resource-efficient control under uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01806">Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.01806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.

                arXiv:2509.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent) with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

                arXiv:2509.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03281">A Brain-Inspired Gating Mechanism Unlocks Robust Computation in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and energy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic advantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized owing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation, providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical validations. This work thus paves the way for more resilient, efficient, and biologically inspired spiking neural networks.

                arXiv:2509.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions. This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110), physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement (CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a single differentiable framework.

Abstract: This note presents a simple and effective variation of genetic algorithm (GA) for solving RCPSP, denoted as 2-Phase Genetic Algorithm (2PGA). The 2PGA implements GA parent selection in two phases: Phase-1 includes the best current solutions in the parent pool, and Phase-2 excludes the best current solutions from the parent pool. The 2PGA carries out the GA evolution by alternating the two phases iteratively. In exploring a solution space, the Phase-1 emphasizes intensification in current neighborhood, while the Phase-2 emphasizes diversification to escape local traps. The 2PGA was tested on the standard benchmark problems in PSPLIB, the results have shown that the algorithm is effective and has improved some of the best heuristic solutions.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly shape decision making in creative design contexts, understanding how humans engage with these tools has become a critical challenge for interactive intelligent systems research. This paper contributes a challenge to rethink how to evaluate human--AI collaborative systems, advocating for a more nuanced and multidimensional approach. Findings from one of the largest field studies to date (n = 808) of a human--AI co-creative system, The Genetic Car Designer, complemented by a controlled lab study (n = 12) are presented. The system is based on an interactive evolutionary algorithm where participants were tasked with designing a simple two dimensional representation of a car. Participants were exposed to galleries of design suggestions generated by an intelligent system, MAP--Elites, and a random control. Results indicate that exposure to galleries generated by MAP--Elites significantly enhanced both cognitive and behavioural engagement, leading to higher-quality design outcomes. Crucially for the wider community, the analysis reveals that conventional evaluation methods, which often focus on solely behavioural and design quality metrics, fail to capture the full spectrum of user engagement. By considering the human--AI design process as a changing emotional, behavioural and cognitive state of the designer, we propose evaluating human--AI systems holistically and considering intelligent systems as a core part of the user experience -- not simply a back end tool.

                arXiv:2508.19660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability, conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits remains challenging. This work bridges the gap between classification accuracy and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average, being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5% accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.

">Children with Autism Show Impaired Oculomotor Entrainment to Predictable Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show altered synchronization with external events, which may underlie the rigidity and reduced adaptability that characterize the condition. We previously demonstrated that electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from children with ASD reveals impaired neuronal entrainment to predictable visual sequences. Whether similar effects are reflected in other physiological signals remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether eye movement and pupil dilation responses exhibit comparable entrainment differences in ASD. Microsaccades (MS) and pupil diameter were recorded from 31 children with ASD (6-9 years) and 21 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) controls during a task in which four equally spaced visual cues preceded an auditory target. We analyzed modulation of MS release time (MS RT) and pupil response time (pupil RT), along with trial-by-trial variability, as indices of ocular entrainment. Both groups exhibited periodic oculomotor responses to the cues, including phasic MS inhibition and repeated pupil constrictions. In TD children, MS RT and pupil RT increased across cues while their variability decreased, consistent with progressive temporal alignment. These effects were significantly reduced in the ASD group. Oculomotor entrainment measures correlated with EEG inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in TD but not ASD children. They also correlated with behavioral response times in both groups, and moderately correlated with autism severity scores. Children with ASD thus showed diminished oculomotor modulation and greater variability in response to predictable stimuli, paralleling earlier EEG findings. These results suggest convergence across physiological systems in indexing impaired processing of predictability in ASD and highlight the promise of multimodal approaches.

">Astrocytic lysosome deficits reduce alpha-synuclein degradation and induce spread of pathology</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra due to Lewy body aggregates, primarily composed of misfolded alpha-synuclein (Syn). While PD progression is thought to be driven by a prion-like spread of Syn aggregates between neurons, the role of astrocytes remains unclear. Observations of Syn pathology in PD patient astrocytes suggest their potential involvement in processing aggregates. To investigate this, we studied astrocytes' interactions with Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) and their effects in astrocyte-neuron co-cultures on the spread of seed-competent Syn. Primary astrocytes quickly internalized and degraded Syn PFFs. However, degradation was significantly hindered by lysosome-compromising agents like chloroquine, Leupeptin, or CA-074. Adding astrocytes to neuron cultures reduced endogenous Syn aggregation, indicating their role in mitigating Syn pathology. When lysosome efficiency in astrocytes was compromised, their anti-seeding effect diminished. Moreover, lysosome-compromised astrocytes preloaded with Syn PFFs enhanced Syn pathology in neurons, whereas unimpaired astrocytes did not. These findings suggest astrocytes can modulate and contribute to Syn pathology spread, playing a significant role in PD pathogenesis.

">Developing a model of temporomandibular disorder in the common marmoset using nerve growth factor</a></h4>

              
                Developing an animal model that more closely represents the human multidimensional pain experience is an important step towards addressing the current chronic pain crisis. The common marmoset has potential as this model species given its biological, neurological and phylogenetic similarity to humans. Here, we developed a model of myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD) in the marmoset by injecting nerve growth factor (NGF) into the superficial masseter. Following injection, animals showed reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds at 5 g and 10 g doses of NGF and changes in circadian rhythm and feeding initiation following injection of 10 g of NGF. Animals did not show evidence of jaw dysfunction, masticatory alterations, or grimace during novel behavioural assays. The model is transient, with pain resolution occurring approximately 7 days after onset, which allows for repeated testing on the same animal. This same NGF-TMD model has been previously validated in rodents and humans and presents an opportunity for forward and reverse translation to examine mechanisms, develop relevant pain assessment tools, and ultimately test novel treatments for TMD and other musculoskeletal pain conditions.

                <p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the <f></f> foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only <f></f> away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~<f></f> away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>

                <p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>

                <p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>

                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) are an important building block in neural activity. Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>

                <p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/36/e2119242025?rss=1">Uncovering the Role of the Human Hippocampus in Procedural Motor Learning: Insights from Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent evidence suggests that the human hippocampus, traditionally associated with declarative memory, plays a role in motor sequence learning (MSL). However, the classic MSL paradigm depends initially on declarative learning. Thus, it is critical to discern whether the participation of the hippocampus relates to its canonical role or to processing a general aspect of learning that transcends the declarative/non-declarative distinction. To address this issue, here we turned to visuomotor adaptation (VMA)&mdash;a type of motor learning involving skill recalibration&mdash;which unlike MSL can be easily manipulated to eliminate the explicit component. We examined the broader involvement of the hippocampus in procedural motor learning by using diffusion MRI in a sample of males and females to assess structural plasticity associated with memory consolidation in VMA and an implicit-only version (IVMA). We found that both VMA and IVMA engaged the left posterior hippocampus in a learning-specific manner. Remarkably, while VMA induced only transient hippocampal alterations, IVMA elicited structural changes that persisted overnight, underscoring the reliance on implicit learning for enduring neuroplasticity. As expected, training on both tasks impacted the microstructure of the cerebellum and the motor and posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the temporal dynamics of changes in these regions paralleled those of the left hippocampus, suggesting that motor and limbic regions operate together as part of the same network. Collectively, our findings support an active role of the hippocampus in implicit motor learning and argue for a unified function in memory encoding regardless of the declarative or non-declarative nature of the task.</p>

                <p>The insular cortex is involved in a wide range of auditory functions in the mammalian brain. We studied the organization and basic response properties of auditory neurons in the insular cortex and adjacent areas by recording responses to sound stimuli in anesthetized female rats. Auditory neurons were present in an insulo-parietal auditory field that spans the boundary between the posterior insula, particularly in the granular insular cortex, and the ventral part of the adjacent nonprimary somatosensory fields. Confirming previous reports, neurons in this field had narrow tuning and were preferentially tuned to relatively low frequencies (&lt;16&nbsp;kHz). Intriguingly, auditory units in this field displayed shorter minimal latencies than units in the primary auditory cortex, as well as weaker sensitivity to deviance. These results establish the existence of a rapid auditory information stream with distinct properties through the insulo-parietal cortex that may parallel the pathway through the primary and anterior auditory fields.</p>

                <p>Prosocial behaviors are crucial for maintaining primates' complex social relationships. As central regions involved in social decision-making, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) processes social salience and value, while the gyrus of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACCg) integrates social information to guide decision-making. Oxytocin, a key modulator of social behavior, can influence both prosocial behavior and neural activity in these regions, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated oxytocin's effects on prosocial behavior and neural activity by infusing oxytocin or saline into the BLA (Oxt-BLA, Sal-BLA) and examining the effects of Oxt-BLA on prosocial decisions, BLA and ACCg neural activity, and the coordination between the two regions in male rhesus macaques. We found that Oxt-BLA's behavioral effects were state-dependent: during high prosocial states, it sustained prosocial choices and task engagement, counteracting the natural decline seen in the control condition. However, during low prosocial states, Oxt-BLA had minimal behavioral effects. At the neural level, Oxt-BLA enhanced BLA and ACCg activity for prosocial choices only during high prosocial states. Importantly, Oxt-BLA maintained stable BLA&ndash;ACCg coordination during high prosocial states, preventing the decline in communication observed in control conditions. These findings demonstrate that oxytocin's ability to sustain prosocial behavior depends on social motivational state. These results support that oxytocin processing in the BLA acts as a state-dependent neuromodulator that enhances BLA and ACCg neural responses and maintains BLA&ndash;ACCg communication to guide prosocial decisions.</p>

                <p>Current research strives to investigate cognitive processes under natural conditions. Virtual reality and EEG are promising techniques combining naturalistic settings with close experimental control. However, many questions and technical challenges remain, e.g., are saccade onsets a suitable replacement of fixation onsets as key events in continuous gaze trajectories (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Amme et al., 2024</cross-ref>), and consequently, can VR capture differences across different stimulus categories associated with varying saccade durations? To address both questions, we investigate the N170 face effect in humans (14 males, 19 females, zero diverse) using a free-viewing and free-movement immersive VR study that contained houses, various background stimuli, and, notably, static and moving pedestrians to study face perception under naturalistic conditions. Our results show that aligning trials to saccade onsets leads to more well-defined ERPs than fixation onsets, especially for the P100 component, demonstrating that saccade-onset ERPs are a better-suited analysis method for this type of experiment. Furthermore, we observe an evolution of category-based differences, i.e., face versus background saccade-onset ERPs, compatible with previous reports but extending in a large temporal window and including all electrode sites at different points in time. In summary, employing VR, EEG, and eye-tracking to investigate differences across fixation categories provides insights into the relevance of saccadic onsets as event triggers and enhances our understanding of cognitive processes in naturalistic settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013426">Optimal algorithms for controlling infectious diseases in real time using noisy infection data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sandor Beregi, Kris V. Parag</p>

Deciding when to enforce or relax non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based on real-time outbreak surveillance data is a central challenge in infectious disease epidemiology. Reporting delays and infection under-ascertainment, which characterise practical surveillance data, can misinform decision-making, prompting mistimed NPIs that fail to control spread or permitting deleterious epidemic peaks that overload healthcare capacities. To mitigate these risks, recent studies propose more data-insensitive strategies that trigger NPIs at predetermined times or infection thresholds. However, these strategies often increase NPI durations, amplifying their substantial costs to livelihood and life-quality. We develop a novel model-predictive control algorithm that optimises NPI decisions. We jointly minimise the cumulative risks and costs of interventions of different stringency over stochastic epidemic projections. Our algorithm is among the earliest to realistically incorporate uncertainties underlying both the generation and surveillance of infections. We find, except under extremely delayed reporting, that our projective approach outperforms data-insensitive strategies and show that earlier decisions strikingly improve real-time control with reduced NPI costs. Moreover, we expose how surveillance quality, disease growth and NPI frequency intrinsically limit our ability to flatten epidemic peaks or dampen endemic oscillations and reveal why this potentially makes Ebola virus more controllable than SARS-CoV-2. Our algorithm provides a general framework for guiding optimal NPI decisions ahead-of-time and identifying the key factors limiting practical epidemic control.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013000">Molecular dynamics study of differential effects of serotonin-2A-receptor (5-HT2AR) modulators</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jordy Peeters, Dimitri De Bundel, Kenno Vanommeslaeghe</p>

The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) is an interesting target for drug design in the context of antidepressants that might have a rapid onset of action and/or be effective in treatment-resistant cases. The main challenge, however, is that the activation of this receptor can provoke hallucinations. Recent studies have shown that activating the receptor with certain (partial) agonists could potentially give rise to antidepressant effect without hallucinogenic side effects. Although substantial research has been done in this area, the atomistic details of this differential activation of the serotonin-2A receptor are not fully understood. In the present study we performed multiple atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R bound with two antipsychotics, three different potential non-hallucinogens and two hallucinogens to identify the receptor’s ligand dependent conformations. Overall, our findings suggest that modest 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation would only yield antidepressant effects and hallucinations result from excessive activation. While modest activation through microdosing may be problematic on account of abuse potential as well as possibly narrow and patient-dependent therapeutic windows, modest activation through administration of a sufficiently weak partial agonist may offer a viable drug development pathway.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental illnesses that significantly impact quality of life. These disorders are associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which can be assessed through heart activity analysis. Heart rate variability (HRV) has shown promise as a potential biomarker for diagnostic support and early screening of those conditions. This study aims to develop and evaluate an automated classification method for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using short-duration electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded with a low-cost wearable device. We conducted classification experiments using machine learning techniques to analyze R-R interval windows extracted from short ECG recordings. The study included 60 participants—30 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and 30 control subjects. We evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, multilayer perceptrons, Gated Recurrent Units, and ensemble methods. Two time window lengths (about 1 and 5 minutes) were evaluated. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, with hyperparameter optimization and patient-level classification based on individual window decisions. Our method achieved classification accuracy of 83% for the 5-fold cross-validation and 80% for the leave-one-out scenario. Despite the complexity of our scenario, which mirrors real-world clinical settings, the proposed approach yielded performance comparable to advanced diagnostic methods reported in the literature. The results highlight the potential of short-duration HRV analysis as a cost-effective and accessible tool for aiding in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our findings support the feasibility of using wearable ECG devices and machine learning-based classification for psychiatric screening, paving the way for further research and clinical applications.

                <p>by Alaska Pokhrel, Lachlan Chisholm, Ariana Costas, Matthew Pittorino, Iain G. Duggin, Bill Söderström</p>

<i>Escherichia coli</i> is arguably one of the most studied bacterial model systems in modern biology. While <i>E. coli</i> are normally rod-shaped gram-negative bacteria, they are known to undergo conditional morphology changes under environmental and nutrient stress. In this study, using an infection-based in-vitro infection model system combined with advanced dynamical imaging, we present the first molecular details of uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (UPEC) dividing to form and proliferate as coccoid-shaped cells inside human host cells. For these intracellular UPEC cells, the frequency of cell division outpaced the rate of cell growth, resulting in a morphological transition from traditional rod-shape to coccobacilli. We also visualized the subcellular protein dynamics in these cells and noted that the division proteins follow the similar localization and constriction patterns that have been demonstrated for vegetative growth. However, unlike for fast-growing rod-shaped cells, FtsZ constriction in intracellular UPEC occurs prior to visual nucleoid segregation. Our results suggest that the modulation of division rate contributes to morphological adaptability of intracellular UPEC at the single-cell level.

                <p>by Jan Willem de Gee, Niels A. Kloosterman, Anke Braun, Tobias H. Donner</p>

Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognition and behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels in human participants through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers’ history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. Atomoxetine and variations of pupil-linked arousal at slower and faster timescales had analogous effects on choice history bias. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions.

                <p>by Joon Ho Choi, Sungwon Bae, Jiho Park, Minsu Yoo, Chul Hoon Kim, Lukas Ian Schmitt, Youngbin Tchoe, Dongil Chung, Ji-Woong Choi, Jong-Cheol Rah</p>

Understanding the neural mechanisms behind short-term memory (STM) errors is crucial for unraveling cognitive processes and addressing deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This study examines whether STM errors arise from misrepresentation of sensory information or decay in these representations over time. Using 2-photon calcium imaging in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a delayed match-to-sample task, we identified a subset of PPC neurons exhibiting both directional and temporal selectivity. Contrary to the hypothesis that STM errors primarily stem from mis-encoding during the sample phase, our findings reveal that these errors are more strongly associated with a drift in neural activity during the delay period. This drift leads to a gradual divergence away from the correct representation, ultimately leading to incorrect behavioral responses. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining stable neural representations in the PPC for accurate STM. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for therapeutic interventions aimed at stabilizing PPC activity during delay periods as a strategy for mitigating cognitive impairments in conditions like schizophrenia.

                Johnson and Lukens review how innate and adaptive immune responses, including microglial activation, interferon signaling, lipid dysregulation, and T cell infiltration, contribute to tauopathy progression. They also discuss potential immune-based strategies that can be deployed in the future to therapeutically mitigate tau-driven neurodegeneration.

The firing rate of neuronal cells in the brain’s amygdala predicts decisions to explore in both learning strategies, but neuronal ‘noise’ predicts exploration decisions only when avoiding losses. Together, these signals explain the increased exploration when risking losses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102930">DNA methylation insulates genic regions from CTCF loops near nuclear speckles</a></h4>

              
                The insulator protein CTCF is essential for mediating chromatin loops and regulating gene expression. While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (DNMT1i) to investigate the characteristics and functions of ‘DNMT1i-specific’ CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that DNMT1i-specific peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles – condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1i-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence RNA abundance but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust toward the loss of speckles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92088">Kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation (kTMP) as a new non-invasive method to modulate cortical excitability</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) provides a method for safely perturbing brain activity, and has been employed in basic research to test hypotheses concerning brain–behavior relationships with increasing translational applications. We introduce and evaluate a novel subthreshold NIBS method: kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation (kTMP). kTMP is a magnetic induction method that delivers continuous kHz-frequency cortical electric fields (E-fields) which may be amplitude modulated to potentially mimic electrical activity at endogenous frequencies. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to compare the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a hand muscle before and after kTMP. In Experiment 1, we applied kTMP for 10 min over motor cortex to induce an E-field amplitude of approximately 2.0 V/m, comparing the effects of waveforms at frequencies of 2.0, 3.5, or 5.0 kHz. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used two forms of amplitude-modulated kTMP (AM kTMP) with a carrier frequency at 3.5 kHz and modulation frequencies of either 20 or 140 Hz. The only percept associated with kTMP was an auditory tone, making kTMP amenable to double-blind experimentation. Relative to sham stimulation, non-modulated kTMP at 2.0 and 3.5 kHz resulted in an increase in cortical excitability, with Experiments 2 and 3 providing a replication of this effect for the 3.5 kHz condition. Although AM kTMP increased MEP amplitude compared to sham, no enhancement was found compared to non-modulated kTMP. kTMP opens a new experimental NIBS space inducing relatively large amplitude subthreshold E-fields able to increase cortical excitability with minimal sensation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94609">Deletion of sulfate transporter SUL1 extends yeast replicative lifespan via reduced PKA signaling instead of decreased sulfate uptake</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of cellular metabolism and growth in response to nutrient availability is crucial for cell survival and can significantly impact on lifespan. Central to this regulation is a class of transporters that sense and transport specific nutrients and transduce the signal downstream to control genes responsible for growth and survival. In this study, we identified SUL1, a plasma membrane transporter responsible for regulating the entry of extracellular sulfate in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, as a key gene for regulating lifespan. We conducted a systematic analysis to delineate the downstream mechanism underlying the lifespan extension by SUL1 deletion. Surprisingly, we found that the lifespan-extending effect of SUL1 deletion is not due to decreased sulfate transport. The SUL1 deletion mutant exhibited decreased PKA signaling, resulting in a series of downstream effects, including increased stress-protective trehalose and glycogen, increased nuclear translocation of MSN2, elevated expression of general stress response genes, enhanced autophagy, and reduced expression of amino acid biosynthetic and ribosomal genes. We demonstrated that the observed increase in lifespan is dependent on MSN2 and autophagy pathways. Our findings exemplify the influence of nutrient signaling rather than the nutrient itself on lifespan regulation and further substantiate the pivotal role of the PKA pathway in this process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106934">WRN and WRNIP1 ATPases impose high fidelity on translesion synthesis by Y-family DNA polymerases</a></h4>

              
                Y-family DNA polymerases (Pols) are intrinsically highly error-prone; yet they conduct predominantly error-free translesion synthesis (TLS) in normal human cells. In response to DNA damage, Y-family Pols assemble and function together with WRN, WRNIP1, and Rev1 in TLS. Among these proteins, WRN possesses a 3’→5’ exonuclease activity and an ATPase/3’→5’ DNA helicase activity, and WRNIP1 has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. In a previous study, we identified a role of WRN 3’→5’ exonuclease activity in the high in vivo fidelity of TLS by Y-family Pols. Here we provide evidence for a crucial role of WRN and WRNIP1 ATPase activities in raising the fidelity of TLS by these Pols. Defects in WRN and WRNIP1 ATPase activities cause a diversity of nucleotide (nt) misincorporations opposite DNA lesions by Y-family Pols, implicating an unprecedented role of these activities in restraining nt misincorporations, which they could accomplish by tightening the active site of the TLS Pol. Altogether, the combined actions of WRN and WRNIP1 ATPases in preventing nt misincorporations and of WRN exonuclease in removing misinserted nts confer such an enormous rise in the fidelity of Y-family Pols that they perform error-free TLS – essential for genome stability and cellular homeostasis.

                Associative recognition memory is essential for our everyday lives, allowing us to form cognitive representations of and remember relationships between things we encounter and their environments, such as where we left our keys or parked the car. Evidence suggests that these associations are represented in the lateral entorhinal and medial prefrontal cortices. However, the identity of neurons in which these associations are formed, the cellular mechanisms supporting them and how representations of object-associations react to changes in the environment are not understood. Here we use transgenic mice to label associative recognition memory engrams in mice, finding that memory recall reactivates engram cells in multiple cortical regions, but that engram cell reactivation only correlates with behavioural performance in the dorsolateral entorhinal cortex, where reactivation was highest in layer 5/6. Chemogenetic inhibition of engram cells in lateral entorhinal cortex impaired memory retrieval. Electrophysiology from ex vivo slices following memory recall demonstrated that engram cells in lateral entorhinal cortex layer 5, but not other cortices or layers, showed increased excitability only when the engram-specific objects had been reconfigured. These data collectively identify neurons in deep layers of lateral entorhinal cortex as probable loci of object-place associations and propose a mechanism by which new information is incorporated into pre-existing neural representations.

">A transformation from vision to imagery in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Extensive work has shown that the visual cortex is reactivated during mental imagery, and that models trained on visual data can predict imagery activity and decode imagined stimuli. These findings may explain why imagery can feel and function like vision, but give little insight into how the brain activity patterns that encode seen and mental images differ. While one popular theory (''weak vision'') suggests that imagery differs from vision only in strength, recent work points to more complex differences. To clarify the relationship between visual and imagery activity in the human brain, we introduce the concept of an imagery transformation - a mapping from visual to imagery activity patterns evoked by the same stimulus. Importantly, this approach can describe a variety of possible scenarios, from simple rescaling to the selective removal or reorientation of activity dimensions. Using two 7T fMRI datasets, we estimated imagery transformations across different visual areas and found they accurately predict imagery activity. We show that imagery transformations are indeed more complex than simple weakening: in early visual cortex, they halve the number of active dimensions and reorient them, such that reconstructions of visual activity in terms of imagery dimensions explain only 25 - 50% of the variance. Nonetheless, these reoriented dimensions still coarsely encode the features encoded by the principal dimensions of visual activity. These findings help to explain the ''same but different'' relationship between mental imagery and vision: imagery activity patterns are transformations of visual activity patterns that approximate them, but encode fewer features and occupy a distinct subspace within the overall space of brain activations.

">Human neuronal firing is modulated by the frequency of local field potential oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations play a critical role in shaping neuronal firing patterns. While phase-locked neuronal firing ("phase tuning") has been extensively studied in animal models and human invasive recordings, much less is known about whether neurons show preferential firing at specific oscillatory frequencies, termed frequency tuning. Here, we employ human intracranial recordings across several brain regions including hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex to test the hypothesis that neurons exhibit frequency-specific firing. We analyzed 357 single units recorded simultaneously with local field potentials in 19 neurosurgical patients during awake resting. We estimated the instantaneous frequency of the LFP using adaptive spectral decomposition and assessed frequency tuning of each neuron while controlling for changes in firing rate unrelated to frequency changes. We found 27% neurons exhibited increased or decreased firing within specific frequencies, most commonly within the low-theta range (<10 Hz). Neurons exhibiting frequency tuning were distinct from those displaying phase tuning, and both types of tuning were observed across multiple brain regions with no anatomical preference. Together, our results demonstrate that the instantaneous frequency of neural oscillations modulates neuronal firing which may serve as an additional mechanism for information processing in the human brain, opening new avenues for frequency-targeted neural stimulation.

">Fetal network controllability co-develops with synaptic density and synchronizes with maternal network controllability during pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                White matter undergoes rapid changes during the fetal period that are foundational for later cognition. However, how these changes contribute to the brain's capacity for dynamic state transitions-its controllability-remains largely unknown. Here, we apply network control theory (NCT) to investigate the developmental trajectory of controllability from the second trimester through the first postnatal month. We analyzed structural connectivity data from 217 fetuses, 448 term infants, and 194 preterm infants as part of the developing Human Connectome Project. We identified a robust, nonlinear U-shaped developmental curve of whole-brain controllability across the perinatal period, with a minimum at approximately 35 gestational weeks. Preterm birth disrupted these trajectories, leading to greater controllability and earlier minimums compared to age-matched fetuses. We used positron emission tomography in seven pregnant rhesus macaques to quantify changes in fetal synaptic density. Increased synaptic density in non-human primates (NHPs) co-occurred with periods of reduced controllability in humans, suggesting that changes in controllability may be driven by synaptogenesis. Finally, using longitudinal scans of a pregnant woman, we mapped the trajectory of changes in maternal controllability during pregnancy. This trajectory exhibited a U-shaped pattern that inversely correlated with the fetal trajectory and reached a maximum around 36 weeks. Together, fetal controllability follows a nonlinear trajectory that co-develops with synaptic density in NHPs and synchronizes with maternal changes in controllability during pregnancy.

">Natural language processing captures memory content associated with shared neural patterns at encoding</a></h4>

              
                People can experience the same event yet form distinct memories shaped by individual interpretations. Prior research shows that multivariate activity patterns in the Default Mode Network (DMN) are correlated across individuals during shared experiences, suggesting a role in representing high-level event features. However, it remains unclear whether these shared neural patterns reflect similarity in subsequent memory content. Here, we examined whether memory similarity correlates with intersubject spatial patterns in the DMN. Using topic modeling, we transformed verbal recall into vectors of latent topics to quantify memory similarity across participants. Twenty-four individuals watched and recounted two cartoon movies during fMRI scanning. We found that greater similarity in recalled content was associated with stronger shared activation patterns at encoding, particularly in the posterior medial cortex. These findings highlight the utility of natural language processing tools in linking memory representations to brain activity and underscore the DMN's role in encoding and interpreting complex event features.

">The cellular associates of late life changes in white matter microstructure</a></h4>

              
                The microstructural architecture of white matter supporting information flow across local circuits and large-scale networks changes throughout the lifespan. However, the genetic and cellular factors underlying age-related variations in white matter microstructure have yet to be established. Here, we examined the genetic associates of individual differences in diffusion-based measures of white matter in a population-based cohort (N=29,862) from the UK Biobank. Estimates of heritability from Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data revealed that genetic factors are linked to population variability in 96.1% of 432 tract microstructural measures. The presence of shared genetic influences was observed to be greater within, relative to between, broad tract classes (commissural, association, projection, and complex cerebellar). Age associations with microstructural changes were estimated across diffusivity measures, with association class tracts showing the greatest vulnerability to age-related decline in older adults. Analyses of imputed cellular associates of age-related changes in white matter revealed a preferential relationship with cell gene markers of oligodendrocytes and other glial cell types, with sparse relationships observed for inhibitory and excitatory cells. These data indicate that white matter tract microstructure is shaped by genetic factors and suggest a role for glial cell-related transcripts in late-life changes in the structural wiring properties of the human brain.

">The Influence of Force Field Perturbations on Symmetric and Asymmetric Bimanual Reaching</a></h4>

              
                Bimanual symmetric and asymmetric reaching movements require the motor system to coordinate the two limbs under varying spatial and physical demands. While prior research has shown a strong tendency for temporal synchronization between the hands, little is known about how bimanual reaching is organized when each limb is subjected to distinct types of force fields, such as viscous or elastic loads. This study systematically investigated how matched (viscous/viscous, elastic/elastic) and mismatched (e.g., viscous/no load, elastic/no load, viscous/elastic) load conditions influence key timing and kinematic parameters during bimanual reaching tasks across different spatial configurations and force magnitudes. Results show that kinematic measures for each arm, including peak velocity, peak acceleration, and peak deceleration, exhibit significant differences across both matched and mismatched load conditions, reflecting clear adaptations in limb behavior. In contrast, temporal aspects of movement-specifically the timepoints of peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, and movement end time-remain coupled under matched loads but become decoupled under mismatched loads, with each limb operating more independently regardless of the spatial configuration of the task. Together, these findings clarify how the motor system balances the need for coordinated bimanual performance with the flexibility required to adapt to varying load conditions. This study extends prior work by demonstrating that not all bimanual reaches are temporally synchronized; instead, task-specific factors such as load type and symmetry critically shape how the limbs coordinate, revealing the motor system's capacity for flexible, context-dependent control.

">An Evaluation of the Efficacy of Single-Echo and Multi-Echo fMRI Denoising Strategies</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is commonly used to study brain-wide patterns of inter-regional functional coupling (FC). However, the resulting signals are vulnerable to multiple sources of noise, such as those related to non-neuronal physiological fluctuations and head motion, which can alter FC estimates and influence their associations with behavioral outcomes. The best strategy for acquiring and processing rsfMRI data to mitigate noise remains an open question. In this study of 358 healthy individuals, we compared the denoising efficacy of 60 multi-echo (ME) and 30 single-echo (SE) rsfMRI preprocessing pipelines across six distinct measures of data quality. We also evaluated how each pipeline influences the effect sizes of FC-based predictive models of personality and cognitive measures estimated via cross-validated kernel ridge regression. We found that ME pipelines generally showed superior denoising efficacy to SE pipelines, but that no single pipeline was associated with both superior denoising efficacy and behavioural prediction. Using a heuristic scheme to rank pipelines across benchmark evaluations, we found that an ME acquisition combined with Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts Independent Component Analysis (ICA-AROMA) and Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offered a reasonable compromise between denoising efficacy and brain-behavior predictions for both ME and SE data. In general, ME pipelines ranked more highly than SE pipelines. These findings support the use of ME acquisitions in future work but suggest that no single denoising pipeline should be considered optimal for all purposes.

">Perceptual Support for Temporal Normalization Across Hundreds of Milliseconds</a></h4>

              
                Perception across time is limited: phenomena like masking and temporal crowding reveal perceptual interference between sequential stimuli, even when separated by hundreds of milliseconds. However the underlying causes of these suppressive temporal interactions remain unclear. A potential explanatory mechanism is temporal normalization, a form of divisive suppression proposed to operate across time in the visual cortex, but largely untested behaviorally. Here in three experiments we tested a key perceptual prediction of temporal normalization: contrast-dependent suppression between sequential stimuli. By independently manipulating the contrasts of two sequential gratings presented 250 ms apart, we found that perceptual sensitivity to a target's orientation decreased when a high- vs. low-contrast non-target appeared either before or after it. Reduced sensitivity arose from both decreased orientation precision and increased "swapping" errors. The results provide perceptual support for a temporal normalization computation operating across hundreds of milliseconds, offering a theoretical framework for perceptual limits across time.

">Alterations in steady-state synchronisation between Acute and Chronic Tinnitus suggests reduction in both tinnitus and central gain.</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism of tinnitus remains unclear as the generation and persistence of tinnitus is not widely understood. The acute tinnitus population serves as an ideal group for investigating the mechanisms behind the origin and persistence of tinnitus, from its initial onset to its subsequent chronification. One of the neural markers for measuring tinnitus such as neural synchrony or central gain is the Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR). The experiment was carried out on 39 participants with acute tinnitus (18 followed back six months post baseline), 30 with chronic tinnitus, and 27 controls. The results reveal that both cross sectionally and longitudinally, there were no significant differences in absolute amplitudes of ASSR across intensities and the slope of ASSR growth function between the groups. However, Controls tend to have an overall increase in ASSR amplitude when compared to Acute and Chronic Tinnitus which can be attributed to changes in neural synchronisation, attentional modulation, tinnitus-related distress, and diminished GABAergic inhibition coinciding with the presence of tinnitus. As there were no changes in the ASSR amplitude between Acute and Chronic Tinnitus or between Acute and Post Acute Tinnitus despite variations in distress and tinnitus loudness, we infer that auditory sensitivity/neural sensitvity is independent of the tinnitus.

">Successful transfer of myoelectric skill from virtual interface to prosthesis control</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Prosthesis control can be seen as a new skill to be learned. To enhance learning, both internal and augmented feedback are exploited. The latter represents external feedback sources that can be designed to enhance learning, e.g. biofeedback. Previous research has shown that augmented feedback protocols can be designed to induce retention by adhering to the guidance hypothesis, but it is not clear yet if that also results in transfer of those skills to prosthesis control. In this study, we test if a training paradigm optimised for retention allows for the transfer of myoelectric skill to prosthesis control. Approach. Twelve limb-intact participants learned a novel myoelectric skill during five one-hour training sessions. To induce retention of the novel myoelectric skill, we used a delayed feedback paradigm. Prosthesis transfer was tested through pre-and post-tests with a prosthesis. Prosthesis control tests included a grasp matching task, the modified box and blocks test, and an object manipulation task, requiring five grasps in total ('power', 'tripod', 'pointer', 'lateral grip', and 'hand open'). Main results. We found that prosthesis control improved significantly following five days of training. Importantly, the prosthesis control metrics were significantly related to the retention metrics during training, but not to the prosthesis performance during the pre-test. Significance. This study shows that transfer of novel, abstract myoelectric control from a computer interface to prosthetic control is possible if the training paradigm is designed to induce retention. These results highlight the importance of approaching myoelectric and prosthetic skills from a skill acquisition standpoint, and open up new avenues for the design of prosthetic training protocols.

">Tool and hand adaptation and localization in immersive virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                The human brain readily adapts movements to achieve motor goals. Most visuomotor adaptation studies use planar reaching with a cursor, where misaligned feedback leads to compensatory adjustments, reach aftereffects, and shifts in perceived hand location. Whether these effects extend to more natural settings and tool use remains unclear. In the Hand Experiment, we showed that in immersive virtual reality (VR), adaptation to 30{degrees} and 60{degrees} visuomotor rotations produced robust reach aftereffects and the expected shifts in hand localization. In the Pen Experiment, we extended this paradigm to a familiar hand-held tool, assessing localization of both the tool tip and the hand. Adaptation with the pen induced comparable or greater recalibration effects than with the hand-cursor, including shifts in both perceived tool and hand position. These findings demonstrate that visuomotor adaptation in immersive VR generalizes beyond cursor-based tasks, revealing how the sensorimotor system recalibrates internal representations of both the body and tools in realistic 3D environments.

">Parallel Belief States account for Learning and Updating of Attentional Priorities in Multidimensional Environments</a></h4>

              
                Inferring the behavioral relevance of visual features is difficult in multidimensional environments as many features could be important. One solution could involve tracking the experience with multiple features and using attentional control to decide which subset of features to explore and chose. Here, we characterize this attentional control process with a model of parallel belief states and test it with a task requiring the learning and updating of attention to features with varying selection histories and motivational costs. We found that exploring and exploiting features was accounted for by a model that tracks the latent beliefs about the relevance of multiple features in parallel. These parallel belief states accounted for the fast learning of feature-based attention, for perseverative selection history effects for features that were previously relevant, and for enhanced learning performance when the motivational costs of making errors increased. Taken together, these results quantify how multiple parallel belief states guide exploration and exploitation of feature-based attention during learning. We suggest parallel belief states represent attentional priorities that are read out by a competitive attentional control process to explore and exploit those visual objects in multidimensional environments that are believed to be relevant.

">Adolescent stress impairs parvalbumin interneurons and their associated perineuronal nets: protective effects of microglia-modulating minocycline treatment</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation during which exposure to stress can lead to long-lasting behavioral and neurobiological alterations linked to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated whether minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that modulates microglial activity, could prevent or attenuate the long-term effects of adolescent stress on behavior, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing (+) interneurons (PVIs), perineuronal nets (PNNs), and microglia in adulthood. Male mice were exposed to a 10-day footshock stress protocol during adolescence (postnatal days 31-40) and treated with minocycline (30 mg/kg; i.p.) either during or after stress exposure. Behavioral assessments in adulthood revealed that adolescent stress impaired sociability, social memory, and object recognition memory, which were attenuated by minocycline treatment during or after adolescent stress exposure. Stress also reduced the number of PV+, PNN+, and PV+/PNN+ cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHip). These effects were prevented by minocycline administration at both time points. No significant long-lasting changes were observed in microglial number, density, or spatial distribution in either region. However, minocycline treatment modulated microglial morphology in a region- and timing-dependent manner, with increased microglial area observed in the PFC and subtle alterations in circularity in the vHip. These findings suggest that adolescent stress induces enduring impairments in PVIs and behavior, possibly through transient microglial intervention and PNN degradation. Minocycline treatment during or after stress was effective in preventing these changes, supporting its potential as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate the long-term consequences of adolescent stress and to reduce vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders.

">Somatostatin released by single O-LM interneurons slowly inhibits intrinsic neuronal excitability in a paracrine and autocrine manner</a></h4>

              
                Somatostatin (SST) is a neuropeptide known to inhibit both neuronal excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission in principal neurons. While SST is expressed in some GABAergic interneurons such as Oriens-Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) cells, the precise conditions governing SST release remain poorly defined. We show here that, in the presence of GABAA receptor antagonist, single O-LM interneurons of CA1 are able to inhibit pyramidal neuron excitability when O-LM cells fire at frequencies above 20 Hz. This inhibition is suppressed by the SST receptor antagonist cyclo-SST and is absent when the O-LM interneuron is located more than 150 micormeters from the pyramidal cell. Likewise, a single O-LM cell was also able to inhibit the intrinsic excitability of another O-LM cell, provided the two cells are in proximity. Exogeneous application of SST transiently inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability in O-LM interneurons through SST1 and SST2, respectively. Notably, this transient inhibition became sustained when clathrin-dependent endocytosis of SST receptors was blocked. Blocking of SST receptors reduced NMDA receptor-mediated responses, prevented induction of both synaptic and intrinsic potentiation in pyramidal neurons and reduced the coherence of theta oscillations. These findings reveal that SST released by O-LM interneurons constitutes an additional inhibitory mechanism, modulating both synaptic excitation and intrinsic excitability beyond the transient inhibition mediated by GABA release.

">Identification of bacterial signals that modulate enteric sensory neurons to influence behavior in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The bacterial microbiome influences many aspects of animal health and disease. Some bacteria have beneficial functions, for example providing nutrients, whereas others act as pathogens. These bacteria are sensed by host cells to induce adaptive changes in physiology and behavior. While immune and intestinal cells detect bacterial signals through well-characterized mechanisms, recent studies indicate that neurons can also directly sense bacterial signals. However, the bacterial sensory mechanisms in neurons are less well understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the enteric sensory neuron NSM innervates the pharyngeal lumen and is directly activated by bacterial food ingestion; in turn, NSM releases serotonin to induce feeding-related behaviors. However, the molecular identities of the bacterial signals that activate NSM are unknown. To identify these signals, we systematically probed bacterial macromolecules from nutritive bacteria using biochemical approaches and GC-MS identification. We find that polysaccharides from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are sufficient to activate NSM. We further identify peptidoglycan from gram-positive bacteria as a specific component capable of activating NSM. NSM responses to polysaccharides require the acid-sensing ion channels DEL-3 and DEL-7, which localize to its sensory dendrite in the pharyngeal lumen. Ingestion of bacterial polysaccharides enhances feeding rates and reduces locomotion, matching the known effects of NSM on behavior. We also examine bacterial signals from pathogenic bacteria that can infect and kill C. elegans. This approach identifies prodigiosin, a metabolite from pathogenic Serratia marcescens, as a bacterial cue that prevents NSM activation by nutritive bacterial signals. This study identifies molecular signals that underlie neuronal recognition of nutritive bacteria in the alimentary canal and competing signals from a pathogenic bacterial strain that mask this form of recognition.

">Distinct contributions and sensorimotor encoding of PV and FoxP2 neurons in the external globus pallidus during perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The external globus pallidus (GPe), a central nucleus of the basal ganglia (BG), comprises diverse cell types, including PV and FoxP2 neurons. While previous studies have delineated their distinct roles in movement regulation and sensory processing, their contributions to perceptual decision-making remain unclear. Here we investigated the sensorimotor functions of PV and FoxP2 neurons in mice performing a Go/No-Go visual task. Optogenetic activation of either population impaired task performance, whereas only inhibition of PV, but not FoxP2 neurons, disrupted behavior. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that PV and FoxP2 neurons exhibited distinct encoding of visual stimuli, licking movement, and trial outcomes. Moreover, inhibiting GPe PV neurons altered stimulus and outcome selectivity, as well as task-related activity, in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a major output nucleus of the BG. These findings reveal that GPe PV and FoxP2 neurons uniquely regulate the flow of sensorimotor information within the BG during perceptual decision-making.

">Representational geometry of emotional empathy in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and in the mid-posterior insula.</a></h4>

              
                Facial expressions provide rapid and informative cues about others' emotional and mental states, playing a critical role in social interactions. However, whether distinct emotional expressions reflect discrete neural processes or arise from varying combinations of underlying affective dimensions such as arousal and valence remains a subject of investigation. Crucially, these accounts need not be mutually exclusive: different brain regions may encode emotional expressions along both categorical and dimensional axes to varying degrees. To test this hypothesis, we probed different brain systems involved in emotion recognition - the ventral attentional network and the cortical limbic system centered on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) - to investigate the extent to which these networks and their subregions encode emotional facial expressions in terms of (1) perceived arousal, (2) arousal+valence, or (3) six discrete emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pain, sadness). To this aim, we modelled the fMRI signal from perceiving movies of facial emotional expressions with ratings for either arousal, arousal+valence or emotion category using representational similarity analysis (RSA) - a method that aims at assessing which ratings model better represents how the perception of facial expressions is reflected by the fMRI parameter estimates across all the voxels within a brain region. This analysis showed that regions in the vmPFC network, including the subgenual cingulate and the medial OFC, are sensitive to ratings for distinct emotion category and for arousal+valence - significantly more so for the former - while they fail to show sensitivity for arousal ratings alone. In the ventral attentional network, the mid-posterior insula showed a similar profile, while the most posterior and ventral insular show evidence of encoding arousal+valence, but not for emotion category or arousal alone. Our findings support the idea that the vmPFC and the mid-posterior insula play a role in encoding emotion-specific and valence representations beyond general arousal processing. These results contribute to understanding how integrative brain regions support emotional empathy and social cognition.

">Learning neural dynamics through instructive signals</a></h4>

              
                Rapid learning is essential for robust behavior, allowing animals to quickly adapt to changing environments and task conditions. However, traditional Hebbian plasticity rules lack the power to induce the rapid, flexible changes in neural dynamics needed for such learning. Here we propose a network model with a rapid, heterosynaptic plasticity rule inspired by circuit motifs in hippocampus, cerebellum, and mushroom body, which relies on interactions between pre-synaptic activity and an "instructive signal" such as dopamine. We show that this rule can quickly produce highly flexible nonlinear dynamics using sparse, low-dimensional instructive signals while also admitting precise mathematical interpretation inspired by the well-known support vector machine. Using adaptive control theory, we additionally derive an online rule allowing such networks to learn using instructive signals guided by real-time feedback. Thus, heterosynaptic instruction-mediated plasticity is a powerful, biologically plausible and analytically tractable mechanism for the rapid learning of flexible dynamics, shedding light on the neural basis of complex adaptive behavior.

">Cortical control of a forelimb prosthesis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Robotic upper-limb prostheses aim to restore the autonomy of paralyzed patients and amputees. So far, advances in this field have relied on monkey pre-clinical and human clinical research. Here, we report on the direct brain control by mice of a miniature mouse forelimb prosthesis. We show that mice implanted with a cortical, microelectrode-based brain-machine interface can learn to control the prosthesis via neuronal operant conditioning, and solve a water collection task in a 2-dimensional and up to a 3-dimensional space. As they learned this task, the mice shaped increasingly consistent prosthesis movements that led to rewards, thanks to coordinated patterns of neuronal activity across the several control dimensions. Beyond the demonstration of unexpected cognitive and motor control abilities in mice, we anticipate that this preclinical model of upper-limb prosthesis control will be a tool to address several of the most pressing issues in BMI-controlled prosthetics.

">Anatomical and Neurochemical Profiles of GABAergic Projection Neurons in the Mouse Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                The inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical hub for the integration of auditory signals in the midbrain. Although both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the IC project to the medial geniculate body (MGB), the detailed neurocircuitry and neurochemical properties of GABAergic projection neurons remain poorly understood. In this study, glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-Cre mice and the viral vector were utilized to selectively visualize the axonal projections of GABAergic neurons in the IC. These neurons project predominantly to the medial division of MGB (MGv) and contralateral IC and minorly to the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body. Importantly, GABAergic projections from both lemniscal and non-lemniscal regions of the IC primarily targeted the lemniscal division of the MGB, whereas those projections from the external cortex of the IC, which is part of the non-lemniscal pathway, additionally extended into non-lemniscal MGB subregions. Using a retrograde tracer, a substantial proportion of GABAergic projection neurons targeting the MGB and contralateral IC were positive for several neurochemical markers, implying that some GABAergic neurons send axon collaterals to both targets. Notably, GABAergic neurons constituted 10% of the total neuronal population in the IC, whereas GABAergic neurons accounted for approximately 20% of IC neurons projecting to the MGB or contralateral IC. Our results suggest that GABAergic projection neurons are more involved in the IC to MGB pathway than would be expected based on their proportion in the IC and may exert widespread influence on auditory processing via direct inhibition of the MGv and indirect modulation through suppression of the contralateral IC.

">Evaluating Place Cell Detection Methods in Ratsand Humans: Implications for Cross-Species Spatial Coding</a></h4>

              
                Place cells, first identified in the rat hippocampus as neurons that fire selectively at specific locations, are central to investigations of the neural underpinnings of spatial navigation. With recent work with human patients, identifying and characterizing place cells across species has become increasingly important for understanding the extent to which decades of rodent research generalize to humans and uncovering principles of spatial cognition. One challenge, however, is that detection methods differ: rodent studies often rely on spatial information (SI), whereas human studies employ analysis of variance (ANOVA) - based approaches. These methodological differences may affect the identified place cell population, which complicates how their properties are interpreted and cross-species comparisons. To address this, we systematically applied multiple detection pipelines to human and rat datasets, supported by simulations that vary place-field properties. Our analyses and simulations demonstrate that spatial information and ANOVA-based approaches are responsive to distinct place field properties: spatial information primarily reflects the contrast between peak and average firing rates, while ANOVA emphasizes consistency across trials. Across species, rodent place cells revealed a broad spectrum of spatial tuning, including strongly tuned neurons with high spatial information (SI) and high ANOVA values. In contrast, human place cells lacked this strongly tuned population and exhibited a narrower distribution of tuning scores, concentrated at the lower end of both spatial tuning metrics. Despite these differences, both species had an overlapping population of neurons with weaker yet consistent spatial tuning, which may support important functional roles such as generalization and mixed selectivity. Together, our study provides a roadmap showing how spatial tuning metrics shape place cell detection and interpretation, while underscoring the functional importance of weaker-tuned neurons in cross-species comparisons.

">Convergent motifs of early olfactory processing are recapitulated by layer-wise efficient coding</a></h4>

              
                The architecture of early olfactory processing is a striking example of convergent evolution. Typically, a panel of broadly tuned receptors is selectively expressed in sensory neurons (each neuron expressing only one receptor), and each glomerulus receives projections from just one neuron type. Taken together, these three motifs--broad receptors, selective expression, and glomerular convergence--constitute "canonical olfaction," since a number of model organisms including mice and flies exhibit these features. The emergence of this distinctive architecture across evolutionary lineages suggests that it may be optimized for information processing, an idea known as efficient coding. In this work, we show that by maximizing mutual information one layer at a time, efficient coding recovers several features of canonical olfactory processing under realistic biophysical assumptions. We also explore the settings in which noncanonical olfaction may be advantageous. Along the way, we make several predictions relating olfactory circuits to features of receptor families and the olfactory environment.

">Deletion of the 5-HT3A receptor reduces behavioral persistence and enhances flexibility</a></h4>

              
                The 5-HT3A receptor is the only ionotropic serotonin receptor and has been implicated in cognitive functions, yet its specific role remains unclear. To investigate the contribution of the 5-HT3A subtype, we trained wild-type (C57BL/6J) and 5-HT3A receptor knockout (Htr3a-/-) mice across a series of operant conditioning tasks and compared their behavioral performance. Following nose-poke training, both groups underwent a rule-switching task, extinction tests under fixed ratio (FR) and variable ratio (VR) reinforcement schedules, and a progressive ratio (PR) task to assess persistence. We found that 5-HT3A receptor knockout mice exhibited reduced responding during the extinction and PR tasks, suggesting diminished behavioral persistence. Notably, however, knockout mice acquired the new rule in the switching task significantly faster than wild-type controls, indicating enhanced cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest that the 5-HT3A receptor plays a role in regulating the balance between behavioral persistence and flexibility, normally biasing this balance toward persistence under normal physiological conditions. This mechanism may underlie the therapeutic effect of 5-HT3A receptor antagonists in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

">Electrophysiological Characteristics of Epidural Spinal Signals in Preclinical Models of Spinal Cord Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Epidural stimulation of the spinal cord evokes distinct electrophysiological responses that can be recorded epidurally. Here, we characterized evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs), doublets (secondary or tertiary ECAPs, likely of different physiological origin than primary ECAPs), evoked synaptic activity potentials (ESAPs), and electromyographic (EMG) signals in preclinical models. Our objective was to clarify the features and distinct physiological origins of these signals, in order to advance mechanistic studies and support clinical applications of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy. Materials and Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-440 g) were implanted with two epidural leads (caudal and rostral; each with eight electrodes) and received monopolar, biphasic stimulation (200 s pulse width) at 2 and 50 Hz, with current increased stepwise to motor threshold. Rhesus macaques (11.5 and 10.2 kg) were implanted with a single 12-electrode epidural lead and stimulated using either tripolar, triphasic pulses at 10 Hz (100 s) or tripolar, biphasic pulses at 3 Hz (80 s) up to 3xECAP threshold. Recordings were taken from non-stimulating electrodes. Results: ECAPs and EMG signals were recorded across multiple spinal segments in both rats (L1-T7) and macaques (L2-T11). Doublets presented as complex waveforms with multiple negative peaks, two in rats and three in macaques, likely representing distinct ECAPs at T11-T6 in a rat and L1-T11 in macaques. ESAPs, detectable in rats, showed anatomical specificity, over the L1/T13 vertebrae with peak responses at L1. Signal analysis included activation thresholds, amplitudes, latencies, and conduction velocities. Conclusions: This study outlines electrophysiological signals evoked by SCS in terms of their waveform, recruitment thresholds, and putative physiological origins. We propose that, to the extent these signals reflect different aspects of spinal processing and may serve as biomarkers of dysregulated nociceptive pathways, as well as indicators of SCS efficacy or potential side effects.

">Spatially Resolved Microglial Expression Around Aβ Plaques in Human Alzheimers Disease Tissue</a></h4>

              
                Using microglia-enriched spatial transcriptomics on human Alzheimers disease tissue, we identify distinct gene expression changes across microglia located in direct contact with plaques, in periplaque regions, and in areas distant from plaques. We define a group of plaque contact only microglial (PCOM) genes whose expression increases exclusively in microglia directly contacting plaques. These genes show significant overlap with previously reported gene sets, suggesting that many of the well-characterised disease-associated microglia (DAM) and other AD-related gene-expression signatures are only upregulated when microglia contact plaques. We further identify distinct co-expression networks associated with disease-relevant covariates, including an immune module linked to APOE genotype and a synaptic-mitochondrial module negatively associated with Braak stage. Finally, we compare the human dataset to our previously published data from 18-month-old AppNL-F mice, generated using the same experimental paradigm and demonstrate cross-species concordance in gene expression particularly within plaque-contacting microglia.

">Chemogenetic Manipulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus-Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata Pathway Promotes Recovery in HemiParkinsonian Rat Models</a></h4>

              
                Motor control through the basal ganglion is mediated primarily thought two pathways, the direct and indirect pathways. The indirect pathway functions in opposition to the direct pathway, balancing excitatory and inhibitory control over motor movement. In Parkinsons disease, the indirect pathway is thought to suppress movements through excessive excitation of inhibitory neurons within the globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. In an attempt to restore this balance, we induced the expression of GAD65 in glutamatergic subthalamic neurons to enable the co-release of GABA. Previous studies indicated co-expression of GABA with glutamate reduces glutamate excitability and might restore balance to the network. Indeed, we observed a reduction in post-lesional amphetamine-induce rotations in 6OHDA lesioned rats co-transduced with GAD65 and excitatory DREADDs and activated by CNO. This study indicates rebalancing inhibitory and excitatory output from the subthalamic nucleus can have a positive effect on motor outcome.

                <p>High-level spinal cord injury (SCI) often reduces neural regulation of cardiovascular function. During the chronic phase, humoral regulation via the renin&ndash;angiotensin system (RAS) is enhanced to compensatorily maintaining blood pressure. It was recently shown that transplanting early-stage neurons into the injured cord mitigates cardiovascular disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying this recovery remain largely unknown. Here, we employed various pharmacological interventions to elucidate whether this strategic transplantation affects the imbalance of neuroendocrine regulation of hemodynamics and the role of specific serotonergic and catecholaminergic components. Female rats received a complete crush at the fourth thoracic spinal cord. Embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) harvested from the raphe nuclei or the spinal cord were transplanted into the lesion. Naive rats or injury alone served as controls. After 8&ndash;9&nbsp;weeks, radio-telemetric recordings demonstrated that both implants decreased tachycardia at rest and diminished the frequency or severity of autonomic dysreflexia (AD). Pharmacological interventions demonstrated that both NPC grafts partially restored neural regulation of blood pressure without normalizing the aberrant RAS hyperactivity. Subsequently, specific neural mechanisms were explored through intrathecal administration of the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> antagonist ketanserin, the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> antagonist WAY100635, or the &alpha;1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin. It revealed that graft-derived serotonergic signaling was involved in the restoration of the resting heart rate via 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors but did not attenuate AD. In addition, catecholaminergic mechanisms remained critical for blood pressure maintenance after SCI. Ultimately, the results provide insight into understanding the mechanistic nuances associated with cell therapy for SCI-induced cardiovascular dysfunction.</p>

                <p>by Eric V. Strobl, Eric R. Gamazon</p>

Root causal genes correspond to the first gene expression levels perturbed during pathogenesis by genetic or non-genetic factors. Targeting root causal genes has the potential to alleviate disease entirely by eliminating pathology near its onset. No existing algorithm has been designed to discover root causal genes from observational data alone. We therefore propose the Transcriptome-Wide Root Causal Inference (TWRCI) algorithm that identifies root causal genes and their causal graph using a combination of genetic variant and unperturbed bulk RNA sequencing data. TWRCI uses a novel competitive regression procedure to annotate cis and trans-genetic variants to the gene expression levels they directly cause. The algorithm simultaneously determines the sequence in which gene expression changes propagate through the system to pinpoint the underlying causal graph and estimate root causal effects. TWRCI outperforms alternative approaches across a diverse group of metrics by directly targeting root causal genes while accounting for distal relations, linkage disequilibrium, patient heterogeneity and widespread pleiotropy. We demonstrate the algorithm by uncovering the root causal mechanisms of two complex diseases, which we confirm by replication using independent genome-wide summary statistics.

                <p>by Madison Shoraka, Herby Jean-Baptiste, Bettina Buttaro, Gillian Queisser</p>

A biofilm is a community of microorganisms adhered to a surface, bound together by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). They are ubiquitous in nature and develop on a range of surfaces including living tissue. Biofilms themselves typically do not negatively affect their host, but under certain conditions they can retain pathogenic features and cause a wide range of illnesses including persistent or chronic infections. In this study, we look at the bacterium <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. <i>E. faecalis</i> is a gram-positive, commensal bacterium commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. Generally, commensal <i>E. faecalis</i> does not negatively impact human health, but pathogenic strains have been found to acquire mobile genetic elements, including plasmids. When <i>E. faecalis</i> with the pCF10 plasmid forms a biofilm it constructs raised complex structures with variable cellular packing, including aggregates, instead of a homogeneous and less densely packed biofilm above a rigid base. This reconfiguration of the biofilm confers resistance to high levels of erythromycin. For this study, we carried out biological experiments which show that pCF10-containing <i>E. faecalis</i> biofilms undergo a rapid reconfiguration of its initial architecture, resulting in a doubling of cellular population over a single hour of antibiotic treatment. We developed a mathematical and computational model, calibrated using image processing techniques, to identify the characteristics of the biofilm’s spatial architecture that allow for the rapid one-hour reconfiguration under treatment. This model involves both stochastic cellular automata and deterministic partial differential equations. The numerical simulations carried out in this study demonstrate that biofilm survival requires both the robust formation of initial complex structures and an associated extracellular DNA (eDNA) cloud. These findings highlight the fundamental role of biofilm heterogeneity, containing aggregated structures with an associated eDNA cloud, in erythromycin resistance of <i>E. faecalis</i> with the pCF10 plasmid. The identification of eDNA as a target to increase the susceptibility of the biofilm to erythromycin could ultimately improve antibiotic treatment protocols.

                <p>by Gui Araujo, Miguel Lurgi</p>

Unveiling the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the assembly of stable and complex ecosystems is a main focus of community ecology. Ecological theory predicts the necessity of structural constraints on the network of species interactions to allow for growth and persistence of multi-species communities. However, the mechanisms behind their emergence are not well understood. An understanding of how the coexistence of diverse species interaction types could influence the development of complexity and how a persistent composition of interactions could arise in nature is needed. Using an eco-evolutionary model, we investigate the assembly of complex species interaction networks with multiple interaction types and its consequences for ecosystem stability. Our results show that highly mutualistic communities promote complex and stable network configurations, thus resulting in a positive complexity-stability relationship. We show that evolution by speciation enhances the emergence of such conditions compared to a purely ecological assembly scenario of repeated invasions by migrating species. Furthermore, communities evolved in isolation promote a disproportionately higher complexity and a larger diversity of outcomes. Our results produce valuable theoretical insight into the mechanisms behind the emergence of ecological complexity and into the roles of mutualism and speciation in community formation.

                <p>by Matthew Aguirre, Jeffrey P. Spence, Guy Sella, Jonathan K. Pritchard</p>

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) govern many core developmental and biological processes underlying human complex traits. Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.

                <p>by Andrew Patton, Jörn Davidsen</p>

Although the brain’s structural and functional alterations with age are individually well documented, how differences in cognitive abilities emerge from variations in the underlying spatio-temporal patterns of regional brain activity is largely unknown. Patterns of increased synchronization between brain regions are taken as enhanced cognitive integration, while decreased synchronization is indicative of cognitive segregation. The ability to dynamically switch between different levels of integration and segregation across different cognitive systems is believed to be crucial for overall cognitive performance. Building on a recently proposed cognitively informed, synchronization-based framework, we study here age-related variations in dynamical flexibility between segregation and integration, as captured by changes in the variable patterns of partial synchronization or chimera states. Leveraging personalized brain network models based on large-scale, multisite datasets of cross-sectional healthy cohorts, we systematically show how regional brain stimulation produces distinct patterns of synchronization. We find that chimera states play a crucial role in regulating the balance between cognitive integration and segregation as the brain ages, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline and preservation in aging. Whereas the emergent synchronization behavior of brain regions belonging to the same cognitive system often show the same aging trends, different cognitive systems can demonstrate distinct trends. This supports the idea that aging affects cognitive systems differently and that understanding this variability is essential for a more comprehensive view of neuro-cognitive aging. At the same time, dynamical flexibility increases in the oldest age groups across most cognitive systems. This may reflect compensatory mechanisms to counteract age-related cognitive declines and points towards a phenomenon of dedifferentiation. Yet, the multiplicity of behaviors highlights that whereas dedifferentiation emerges in certain cognitive systems, differentiation can also occur in others. This illustrates that these processes, though seemingly oppositional, can coexist and unfold in parallel across different cognitive systems.

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle essential for various cellular functions, particularly signal transduction. While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE1) cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation delays ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited distal appendage dysregulation, failure to remove CP110/CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicle docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels.

                <p>by Emilio E. Méndez-Olivos, Katrinka M. Kocha, Joshua Bloomekatz, Shan Liao, Peng Huang</p>

In vertebrates, the sclerotome is a transient embryonic structure that gives rise to various tissue support cells, including fibroblasts. However, how fibroblast precursors are guided to diverse tissues remain poorly understood. Using zebrafish, our lab has previously shown that sclerotome-derived cells undergo extensive migration to generate distinct fibroblast subtypes, including tenocytes along the myotendinous junction and fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold. The pan-fibroblast gene platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (<i>pdgfra</i>), which has been implicated in cell migration across various contexts, is specifically expressed in the sclerotome and its descendants. Loss of functional Pdgfra in a <i>pdgfra</i> gene-trap mutant results in severe defects in the migration of sclerotome-derived cells, leading to a dose-dependent loss of tenocytes and fin mesenchymal cells. By combining live imaging and mosaic labeling with a membrane-bound dominant-negative tool, we demonstrate that Pdgfra acts cell-autonomously to regulate the migration of sclerotome-derived cells. In the absence of ligand <i>pdgfab</i>, which is expressed in the medial somite, sclerotome-derived cells fail to migrate medially, resulting in a loss of tenocytes, although they can migrate normally toward the fin fold and generate fin mesenchymal cells. Strikingly, localized expression of Pdgfab in <i>pdgfab</i> mutants can direct the migration of sclerotome-derived cells to both normal and ectopic locations, suggesting a chemoattractive role for the Pdgfab ligand. Together, our results demonstrate that Pdgfab/Pdgfra-mediated chemoattraction guides the migration of sclerotome-derived fibroblast precursors to specific locations, where they diversify into distinct fibroblast subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003352">Viral expansion after transfer is a primary driver of influenza A virus transmission bottlenecks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie E. Holmes, Lucas M. Ferreri, Baptiste Elie, Ketaki Ganti, Chung-Young Lee, David VanInsberghe, Anice C. Lowen</p>

For many viruses, narrow bottlenecks acting during transmission sharply reduce genetic diversity in a recipient host relative to the donor. Since genetic diversity represents adaptive potential, such losses of diversity are thought to limit the opportunity for viral populations to undergo antigenic change and other adaptive processes. Thus, a detailed picture of evolutionary dynamics during transmission is critical to understanding the forces driving viral evolution at an epidemiologic scale. To advance this understanding, we used a barcoded virus library and a guinea pig model of transmission to decipher where in the transmission process influenza A virus populations lose diversity. In inoculated guinea pigs, we show that a high level of viral barcode diversity is maintained. Within-host continuity in the barcodes detected across time furthermore indicates that stochastic effects are not pronounced within the inoculated hosts. Importantly, in both aerosol-exposed and direct contact animals, we observed many barcodes at the earliest time point(s) positive for infectious virus, indicating robust transfer of diversity through the environment. This high viral diversity is short-lived, however, with a sharp decline seen 1–2 days after initiation of infection. Although major losses of diversity at transmission are well described for influenza A virus, our data indicate that events that occur following viral transfer and during the earliest stages of natural infection have a central role in this process. This finding suggests that host factors, such as immune effectors, may have greater opportunity to impose selection during influenza A virus transmission than previously recognized.

                <p>by Emily P. Van Syoc, Emily R. Davenport, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Human genetic determinants of the gut mycobiome remain uninvestigated despite decades of research highlighting tripartite relationships between gut bacteria, genetic background, and disease. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study on the number and types of human genetic loci influencing gut fungi relative abundance. We detect 148 fungi-associated variants (FAVs) across 7 chromosomes that statistically associate with 9 fungal taxa. Of these FAVs, several occur in the protein-coding genes <i>PTPRC</i>, <i>ANAPC10</i>, <i>NAV2</i>, and <i>CDH13</i>. Additional FAVs link to tissue-specific gene expression as fungi-associated expression quantitative trait loci. Notably, the relative abundance of gut yeast <i>Kazachstania</i> associates with genetic variation in <i>CDH13</i> encoding T-cadherin, a protein linked to cardiovascular disease. <i>Kazachstania</i> forms a causal relationship with cardiovascular disease risk in a mendelian two-sample randomization analysis. These findings establish previously unrecognized connections between human genetics, gut fungi, and chronic disease, broadening the paradigm of human-microbe interactions in the gut to the mycobiome.
