              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20831">BACE: Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation for Interpretable Graphs of Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines. Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions during behavior.

                arXiv:2510.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial world models, representations that support flexible reasoning about spatial relations, are central to developing computational models that could operate in the physical world, but their precise mechanistic underpinnings are nuanced by the borrowing of underspecified or misguided accounts of human cognition. This paper revisits the simulation versus rendering dichotomy and draws on evidence from aphantasia to argue that fine-grained perceptual content is critical for model-based spatial reasoning. Drawing on recent research into the neural basis of visual awareness, we propose that spatial simulation and perceptual experience depend on shared representational geometries captured by higher-order indices of perceptual relations. We argue that recent developments in embodied AI support this claim, where rich perceptual details improve performance on physics-based world engagements. To this end, we call for the development of architectures capable of maintaining structured perceptual representations as a step toward spatial world modelling in AI.

                arXiv:2510.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely defining consciousness and identifying the mechanisms that effect it is a long-standing question, particularly relevant with advances in artificial intelligence. The scientific community is divided between physicalism and natural dualism. Physicalism posits consciousness is a physical process that can be modeled computationally; natural dualism rejects this hypothesis. Finding a computational model has proven elusive, particularly because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities exhibited by humans, such as intelligence and physiological sensations. Here we show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness, natural or artificial, identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect it, confirming the physicalism hypothesis. We found such a model is obtainable when including the underlying (biological or digital) substrate and accounting for reactive behavior in substrate sub-systems (e.g., autonomous physiological responses). Results show that, unlike all other computational processes, consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities. Our result shows there is no impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but, surprisingly, that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever, and that there is no advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness.

                arXiv:2510.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20847">Integrated representational signatures strengthen specificity in brains and models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which different neural or artificial neural networks (models) rely on equivalent representations to support similar tasks remains a central question in neuroscience and machine learning. Prior work has typically compared systems using a single representational similarity metric, yet each captures only one facet of representational structure. To address this, we leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics-each capturing a distinct facet of representational correspondence, such as geometry, unit-level tuning, or linear decodability-and assess brain region or model separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics that preserve geometric or tuning structure (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield stronger region-based discrimination, whereas more flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode brain-region- or model-family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models. To integrate these complementary representational facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a framework originally developed for multi-omics data integration. SNF produces substantially sharper regional and model family-level separation than any single metric and yields robust composite similarity profiles. Moreover, clustering cortical regions using SNF-derived similarity scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual cortex-surpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics.

                arXiv:2510.20848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classic view of cortical rhythms, the interaction between excitatory pyramidal neurons (E) and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons (I) has been shown to be sufficient to generate gamma and beta band rhythms. However, it is now clear that there are multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes and that they play important roles in the generation of these rhythms. In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20855">BrainCognizer: Brain Decoding with Human Visual Cognition Simulation for fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain decoding is a key neuroscience field that reconstructs the visual stimuli from brain activity with fMRI, which helps illuminate how the brain represents the world. fMRI-to-image reconstruction has achieved impressive progress by leveraging diffusion models. However, brain signals infused with prior knowledge and associations exhibit a significant information asymmetry when compared to raw visual features, still posing challenges for decoding fMRI representations under the supervision of images. Consequently, the reconstructed images often lack fine-grained visual fidelity, such as missing attributes and distorted spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose BrainCognizer, a novel brain decoding model inspired by human visual cognition, which explores multi-level semantics and correlations without fine-tuning of generative models. Specifically, BrainCognizer introduces two modules: the Cognitive Integration Module which incorporates prior human knowledge to extract hierarchical region semantics; and the Cognitive Correlation Module which captures contextual semantic relationships across regions. Incorporating these two modules enhances intra-region semantic consistency and maintains inter-region contextual associations, thereby facilitating fine-grained brain decoding. Moreover, we quantitatively interpret our components from a neuroscience perspective and analyze the associations between different visual patterns and brain functions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that BrainCognizer outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple evaluation metrics.

                arXiv:2510.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cognitive science and AI, a longstanding question is whether machines learn representations that align with those of the human mind. While current models show promise, it remains an open question whether this alignment is superficial or reflects a deeper correspondence in the underlying dimensions of representation. Here we introduce a methodology to probe the internal geometry of vision-language models (VLMs) by having them generate pairwise similarity judgments for a complex set of natural objects. Using multidimensional scaling, we recover low-dimensional psychological spaces and find that their axes show a strong correspondence with the principal axes of human perceptual space. Critically, when this AI-derived representational geometry is used as the input to a classic exemplar model of categorization, it predicts human classification behavior more accurately than a space constructed from human judgments themselves. This suggests that VLMs can capture an idealized or `denoised' form of human perceptual structure. Our work provides a scalable method to overcome a measurement bottleneck in cognitive science and demonstrates that foundation models can learn a representational geometry that is functionally relevant for modeling key aspects of human cognition, such as categorization.

                arXiv:2510.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is a foundational tool for analyzing neural spike train data. However, standard implementations rely on discretizing spike times into binned count data, limiting temporal resolution and scalability. Here, we develop Monte Carlo (MC) methods and polynomial approximations (PA) to the continuous-time analog of these models, and show them to be advantageous over their discrete-time counterparts. Further, we propose using a set of exponentially scaled Laguerre polynomials as an orthogonal temporal basis, which improves filter identification and yields closed-form integral solutions under the polynomial approximation. Applied to both synthetic and real spike-time data from rodent hippocampus, our methods demonstrate superior accuracy and scalability compared to traditional binned GLMs, enabling functional connectivity inference in large-scale neural recordings that are temporally precise on the order of synaptic dynamical timescales and in agreement with known anatomical properties of hippocampal subregions. We provide open-source implementations of both MC and PA estimators, optimized for GPU acceleration, to facilitate adoption in the neuroscience community.

Abstract: A fine-grained account of functional selectivity in the cortex is essential for understanding how visual information is processed and represented in the brain. Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder-decoder transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a "digital twin" offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses about visual selectivity in the human brain - hypotheses that can guide future fMRI experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21265">EEG Dynamic Microstate Patterns Induced by Pulsed Wave Transcranial Photobiomodulation Therapy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.21265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy is an emerging, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated considerable potential in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have found that pulsed wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed. Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21588">Contribution of task-irrelevant stimuli to drift of neural representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that, even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift. Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying computation in the brain.

                arXiv:2510.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

                arXiv:2510.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision, their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets, which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

                arXiv:2506.00138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as model-based intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal -- without any behavioral or neural training data -- demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

                arXiv:2506.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in large-scale recording technologies now enable simultaneous measurements from multiple brain areas, offering new opportunities to study signal transmission across interacting components of neural circuits. However, neural responses exhibit substantial trial-to-trial variability, often driven by unobserved factors such as subtle changes in animal behavior or internal states. To prevent evolving background dynamics from contaminating identification of functional coupling, we developed a hybrid neural spike train model, GLM-Transformer, that incorporates flexible, deep latent variable models into a point process generalized linear model (GLM) having an interpretable component for cross-population interactions. A Transformer-based variational autoencoder captures nonstationary individual-neuron dynamics that vary across trials, while standard nonparametric regression GLM coupling terms provide estimates of directed interactions between neural populations. We incorporate a low-rank structure on population-to-population coupling effects to improve scalability. Across synthetic datasets and mechanistic simulations, GLM-Transformer recovers known coupling structure and remains robust to shared background fluctuations. When applied to the Allen Institute Visual Coding dataset, it identifies feedforward pathways consistent with established visual hierarchies. This work offers a step toward improved identification of neural population interactions, and contributes to ongoing efforts aimed at achieving interpretable results while harvesting the benefits of deep learning.

                arXiv:2506.14957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

                arXiv:2509.02139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii) Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image transformations.

                arXiv:2406.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields from the brain are tiny relative to ambient fields which therefore need to be suppressed. The common solution of passive shielding is expensive, bulky and insufficiently effective, thus motivating research into the alternative of active shielding which comes in two flavours: feed-back and feed-forward. In feed-back designs (the most common), corrective fields are created by coils driven from sensors within the area that they correct, for example from the main sensors of an MEG device. In feed-forward designs (less common), corrective fields are driven from dedicated reference sensors outside the area they correct. Feed-forward can achieve better performance than feed-back, in principle, however its implementation is hobbled by an unavoidable coupling between coils and reference sensors, which reduces the effectiveness of the shielding and may affect stability, complicating the design. This paper suggests a solution that relies on a ``decoupling matrix," inserted in the signal pathway between sensors and corrective coils, to counteract the spurious coupling. This allows feed-forward shielding do reduce the ambient field to zero across the full frequency range, in principle, although performance may be limited by other factors such as current noise. The solution, which is fully data-driven and does not require geometric calculations, high-tolerance fabrication, or physical calibration, has been evaluated by simulation, but not implemented in hardware. It might contribute to the deployment of a new generation of measurement systems based on optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM). The lower cost and reduced constraints of those systems are a strong incentive to likewise reduce the cost and constraints of the shielding required to operate them, hence the appeal of active shielding.

                arXiv:2410.19315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference in both brains and machines can be formalized by optimizing a shared objective: maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in machine learning, or minimizing variational free energy (F) in neuroscience (ELBO = -F). While this equivalence suggests a unifying framework, it leaves open how inference is implemented in neural systems. Here, we introduce FOND (Free energy Online Natural-gradient Dynamics), a framework that derives neural inference dynamics from three principles: (1) natural gradients on F, (2) online belief updating, and (3) iterative refinement. We apply FOND to derive iP-VAE (iterative Poisson variational autoencoder), a recurrent spiking neural network that performs variational inference through membrane potential dynamics, replacing amortized encoders with iterative inference updates. Theoretically, iP-VAE yields several desirable features such as emergent normalization via lateral competition, and hardware-efficient integer spike count representations. Empirically, iP-VAE outperforms both standard VAEs and Gaussian-based predictive coding models in sparsity, reconstruction, and biological plausibility, and scales to complex color image datasets such as CelebA. iP-VAE also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, exceeding hybrid iterative-amortized VAEs. These results demonstrate how deriving inference algorithms from first principles can yield concrete architectures that are simultaneously biologically plausible and empirically effective.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19648">Spectral Analysis of Representational Similarity with Limited Neurons</a></h4>

Abstract: Understanding representational similarity between neural recordings and computational models is essential for neuroscience, yet remains challenging to measure reliably due to the constraints on the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously. In this work, we apply tools from Random Matrix Theory to investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We propose an analytical framework for representational similarity analysis that relates measured similarities to the spectral properties of the underlying representations. We demonstrate that neural similarities are systematically underestimated under finite neuron sampling, mainly due to eigenvector delocalization. Moreover, for power-law population spectra, we show that the number of localized eigenvectors scales as the square root of the number of recorded neurons, providing a simple rule of thumb for practitioners. To overcome sampling bias, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints.

                arXiv:2505.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13763">Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring and Control of Their Internal Activations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, yet at other times seem unable to recognize those strategies that govern their behavior. This suggests a limited degree of metacognition - the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognition enhances LLMs' capabilities in solving complex tasks but also raises safety concerns, as models may obfuscate their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight (e.g., safety detector). Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand their metacognitive abilities. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm that uses in-context learning to quantify metacognitive abilities of LLMs to report and control their activation patterns. We demonstrate that their abilities depend on several factors: the number of in-context examples provided, the semantic interpretability of the neural activation direction (to be reported/controlled), and the variance explained by that direction. These directions span a "metacognitive space" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a small subset of their neural activations. Our paradigm provides empirical evidence to quantify metacognition in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety (e.g., adversarial attack and defense).

                arXiv:2505.09816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that synaptic weights in the brain follow heavy-tailed distributions, yet most theoretical analyses of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) assume Gaussian connectivity. We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible L\'evy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable -- implying ubiquitous chaos -- our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader parameter regime near the edge of chaos, namely a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks -- where mean-field theory breaks down -- we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.

                arXiv:2408.07908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seeking high-quality representations with latent variable models (LVMs) to reveal the intrinsic correlation between neural activity and behavior or sensory stimuli has attracted much interest. In the study of the biological visual system, naturalistic visual stimuli are inherently high-dimensional and time-dependent, leading to intricate dynamics within visual neural activity. However, most work on LVMs has not explicitly considered neural temporal relationships. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Evolving Visual Dynamical System (TE-ViDS), a sequential LVM that decomposes neural activity into low-dimensional latent representations that evolve over time. To better align the model with the characteristics of visual neural activity, we split latent representations into two parts and apply contrastive learning to shape them. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real neural datasets from the mouse visual cortex demonstrate that TE-ViDS achieves the best decoding performance on naturalistic scenes/movies, extracts interpretable latent trajectories that uncover clear underlying neural dynamics, and provides new insights into differences in visual information processing between subjects and between cortical regions. In summary, TE-ViDS is markedly competent in extracting stimulus-relevant embeddings from visual neural activity and contributes to the understanding of visual processing mechanisms.

                arXiv:2510.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI) and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low- and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings. When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal learning in complex contexts.

                arXiv:2510.21403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing through an event-driven paradigm. While training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose two novel channel-mixer architectures: \underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct \underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN architectures across a broader range of tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21407">REvolution: An Evolutionary Framework for RTL Generation driven by Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search, hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution, a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs' generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the local-search limitations of previous methods.

                arXiv:2510.21647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoW Protocol batch auctions aggregate user intents and rely on solvers to find optimal execution paths that maximize user surplus across heterogeneous automated market makers (AMMs) under stringent auction deadlines. Deterministic single-objective heuristics that optimize only expected output frequently fail to exploit split-flow opportunities across multiple parallel paths and to internalize gas, slippage, and execution risk constraints in a unified search. We apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization to this blockchain routing problem, proposing a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) architecture for real-time solver optimization that combines a production-grade, multi-objective NSGA-II engine with adaptive instance profiling and deterministic baselines. Our core engine encodes variable-length path sets with continuous split ratios and evolves candidate route-and-volume allocations under a Pareto objective vector F = (user surplus, -gas, -slippage, -risk), enabling principled trade-offs and anytime operation within the auction deadline. An adaptive controller selects between GA and a deterministic dual-decomposition optimizer with Bellman-Ford based negative-cycle detection, with a guarantee to never underperform the baseline. The open-source system integrates six protection layers and passes 8/8 tests, validating safety and correctness. In a 14-stratum benchmark (30 seeds each), the hybrid approach yields absolute user-surplus gains of approximately 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders, while large high-fragmentation orders are unprofitable across gas regimes. Convergence occurs in about 0.5 s median (soft capped at 1.0 s) within a 2-second limit. We are not aware of an openly documented multi-objective GA with end-to-end safety for real-time DEX routing.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety. Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience, leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n), based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a 13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding significant clinical application value.

                arXiv:2408.05098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural-network processing in machine learning applications relies on layer synchronization. This is practiced even in artificial Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are touted as consistent with neurobiology, in spite of processing in the brain being in fact asynchronous. A truly asynchronous system however would allow all neurons to evaluate concurrently their threshold and emit spikes upon receiving any presynaptic current. Omitting layer synchronization is potentially beneficial, for latency and energy efficiency, but asynchronous execution of models previously trained with layer synchronization may entail a mismatch in network dynamics and performance. We present and quantify this problem, and show that models trained with layer synchronization either perform poorly in absence of the synchronization, or fail to benefit from any energy and latency reduction, when such a mechanism is in place. We then explore a potential solution direction, based on a generalization of backpropagation-based training that integrates knowledge about an asynchronous execution scheduling strategy, for learning models suitable for asynchronous processing. We experiment with two asynchronous neuron execution scheduling strategies in datasets that encode spatial and temporal information, and we show the potential of asynchronous processing to use less spikes (up to 50%), complete inference faster (up to 2x), and achieve competitive or even better accuracy (up to 10% higher). Our exploration affirms that asynchronous event-based AI processing can be indeed more efficient, but we need to rethink how we train our SNN models to benefit from it.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient and dynamic spatio-temporal data processing. This paper reformulates a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, as a time-series segmentation task suited for SNN execution. Automated systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram encoding methods and network parameters, applying first and second-order leaky integrate and fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. We introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, improving detection performance across multiple encodings strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling initial results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). We position SNNs as a viable path towards real-time RFI detection, with many possibilities for follow-up studies. These findings highlight the potential for SNNs performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way towards efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.

                arXiv:2508.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) frequently arise in real-world applications where multiple conflicting objectives must be optimized under complex constraints. Existing dual-population two-stage algorithms have shown promise by leveraging infeasible solutions to improve solution quality. However, designing high-performing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) remains a challenging task due to the intricacy of algorithmic components. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for assisting with algorithm design; however, their effective integration into such tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LLM4CMO, a novel CMOEA based on a dual-population, two-stage framework. In Stage 1, the algorithm identifies both the constrained Pareto front (CPF) and the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF). In Stage 2, it performs targeted optimization using a combination of hybrid operators (HOps), an epsilon-based constraint-handling method, and a classification-based UPF-CPF relationship strategy, along with a dynamic resource allocation (DRA) mechanism. To reduce design complexity, the core modules, including HOps, epsilon decay function, and DRA, are decoupled and designed through prompt template engineering and LLM-human interaction. Experimental results on six benchmark test suites and ten real-world CMOPs demonstrate that LLM4CMO outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the LLM-aided modular design. These findings offer preliminary evidence that LLMs can serve as efficient co-designers in the development of complex evolutionary optimization algorithms.

                arXiv:2505.16649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) learning algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function with well-designed negative samples for contrastive learning. Existing goodness functions are typically defined as the sum of squared postsynaptic activations, neglecting correlated variability between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for noisy copies of individual inputs while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples.We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared output, which is equivalent to making predictions based on an energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

                arXiv:2505.19458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

                arXiv:2506.08966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models' representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' precision, judged by our probe's accuracy, explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern our probes discover can mitigate these errors.

                arXiv:2507.07207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts.

                arXiv:2510.12837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural evolution allows ideas and technology to build over generations, a process reaching its most complex and open-ended form in humans. While social learning enables the transmission of such innovations, the cognitive processes that generate innovations remain unclear. We propose that semantic knowledge-the associations linking concepts to their properties and functions-guides human innovation and drives cumulative culture. To test this, we combined an agent-based model, which examines how semantic knowledge shapes cultural evolutionary dynamics, with a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243) testing its role in human innovation. Semantic knowledge directed exploration toward meaningful solutions and interacted synergistically with social learning to amplify innovation and cultural evolution. Participants lacking access to semantic knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social information was available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies for innovation. Together, these findings indicate that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative culture.

">The songbird basal ganglia connectome</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) play an essential role in shaping vertebrate behavior, ranging from motor learning to emotions, but comprehensive maps of their canonical synaptic architecture are missing. In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways. Our data thus challenge the universality of the view of the basal ganglia as an information processor organized into discrete feedforward pathways.

">Connectivity and phenotype of vasopressin 1a receptor cells in the lateral septum</a></h4>

              
                The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) regulates sexually-differentiated social behaviors, including sexual behavior, aggression, and social communication. Much of AVP's effect on social behavior is mediated by the most widely-expressed AVP receptor in the central nervous system: the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). Dense expression of V1aR is found in males and females in the lateral septum (LS), which also receives heavy input from sexually-differentiated populations of AVP cells in the extended amygdala. In order to access and interrogate the structure and function of V1aR cells, we developed and validated a V1aR-Cre knockin mouse line (Avpr1a-P2A-iCre). V1aR-Cre mice did not differ from their Cre-negative littermates in their health, sensorimotor function, anxiety/motivational behavioral responses, or in their V1aR binding levels in the LS. The distribution of Cre in the brain, as assessed by crosses with Cre-reporter mouse lines and in situ hybridization (ISH), was highly similar to patterns of V1aR binding and demonstrated strong colocalization between Cre and V1aR expression within LS cells. We used this V1aR-Cre mouse to identify the inputs and outputs of V1aR+ cells in the LS, via a monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus as well as anterograde synaptophysin-mRuby AAV tracing approaches. Monosynaptic inputs to V1aR LS cells were observed from the medial preoptic area (MPA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), hippocampus (mostly ventral), medial septum, diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Synaptophysin labeling revealed outputs to some of these same structures (MS, LH, DBB, SuM) as well as parts of the lateral preoptic area (LPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), and ventral pallidum. Notably, most structures (except for hippocampus) bidirectionally connected to V1aR LS cells also contain populations of V1aR+ cells and are targets for BNST/MeA AVP cells, suggesting an integrated AVP/V1aR circuit. Finally, using ISH, we measured levels of V1aR mRNA expression in subregions of the LS and colocalization of V1aR with oxytocin receptor (OTR) mRNA, which also has a high affinity for AVP, within the LS. We found similar high percentages of cells containing V1aR+ puncta across dorsal and intermediate LS in both males and females. In contrast, the ventral LS contained fewer V1aR+ cells in both males and females. The highest level of co-expression of V1aR and OTR was found in the intermediate LS in both sexes, suggesting the possible location of functional interactions between AVP and oxytocin within the LS. We also sought to identify other phenotypic aspects of V1aR cells using ISH and confirmed that all LS V1aR cells are GABAergic and that most also express corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, suggesting a substrate by which AVP could interact with stress-related systems in the LS. Our characterized V1aR-Cre mouse will be a valuable resource for understanding the role of AVP/V1aR in behavioral and physiological systems. Using this mouse, we have characterized the connectional architecture of V1aR cells in the LS and revealed an interlocking set of structures that may be the substrate through which AVP regulates social and emotional behavior.

">Topological analysis of neuronal assemblies reveals low-rank structure modulated by cholinergic activity</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal assemblies are fundamental building blocks of brain function (e.g. memory, spatial navigation, eye fixation, etc.). However, the principles underlying the connectivity patterns that support their function have remained elusive. The optic tectum of the zebrafish larva is organized into distinct functional neuronal assemblies. These assemblies display all-or-none preferred activation states and inhibitory competition, mechanisms that improve the decoding of visual information. Here, we combined light-sheet microscopy to capture the dynamics of large neuronal networks ([~]2,000 neurons) in the optic tectum; genetic cell-type markers for studying the physiological and functional properties of tectal assemblies; and techniques from topological data analysis to study the dynamic connectivity patterns that enable the emergence and functional role of the neuronal assemblies. We found that during spontaneous activations, tectal assemblies maintain a tight and stable ratio of E-I activity despite the large increase in activity. Topological analysis of the spontaneous activations indicated a low-rank organization of the assemblies and a discrete number of temporal activation patterns. Finally, we observed that the cholinergic system can modulate the topological features of the assemblies to alter their functional role.

">Frequency-Dependent Modulation of the Prefrontal Cortex by Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound: Impact on Mesolimbic Dopamine Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Synchronized neural oscillations are fundamental for cognitive function and orchestrate inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission and downstream signaling. We hypothesized that low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) with frequency parameters mimicking oscillatory patterns would enable targeted neuromodulation. Building on prior findings of the ability of LIFU to modulate neurotransmission, we investigated the effects of frequency-modulated LIFU applied to the prelimbic cortex (PLC) on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core as well as neuronal and astrocytic activity. After three 80-second LIFU stimulations spaced 30 minutes apart, we found that LIFU excited or inhibited NAcc dopamine release for up to 90 minutes, and these effects were dependent on oscillation frequency and sex. In male rats, theta (8 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) LIFU reduced both dopamine release by 58% and the level of the astrocytic marker GFAP by 50%. Similar decreases in dopamine density were observed in females. Delta (2 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) stimulation produced similar inhibitory effects. Conversely, theta (5 Hz)-coupled gamma (50 Hz) LIFU increased dopamine release by 28% in males. However, similar excitation levels were observed only in females with an increased gamma frequency of 70 Hz (coupled with a theta frequency of 7 Hz). Histological analysis revealed no cell death, but both 8:16 Hz and 5:50 Hz LIFU elevated neuronal activation (cFOS) in the PLC in males, while 5:50 Hz also upregulated GFAP by 30%, suggesting astrocytic involvement. Thus, LIFU stimulation of the PLC can be frequency-tuned to selectively excite or inhibit dopaminergic signaling in the NAcc, suggesting a novel approach for manipulating neurotransmission.

">Electrostatic Interaction Determines the Docking Specificity and the Formation of Functional Cx36 Gap Junction Channels</a></h4>

              
                Connexin36 (Cx36) is broadly expressed in neurons and serves as the principal protein to form interneuronal gap junctions (GJs), also known as electrical synapses. Recent high-resolution structures of human Cx36 GJ have revealed crucial electrostatic interactions (ESIs) between two docked Cx36 hemichannels at the second extracellular (E2) loops. Despite their structural importance, the functional roles of these ESIs remain poorly understood. To investigate their significance, we systematically designed and tested a series of missense variants targeting key E2 interface residues, aiming to disrupt or modulate the electrostatic landscape at the docking interface. Based on the ESI pairs defined from the crystal structure, our combined computational calculations and dual patch-clamp experiments in engineered HEK293 cell pairs suggest that at least three ESI residual pairs per E2-E2 interface are required to support functional GJ formation. Furthermore, we found that these unique ESIs of Cx36 ensure its docking specificity to itself, preventing the formation of heterotypic GJs with other brain connexins (Cx26, Cx30, Cx31.3, Cx32, Cx43, Cx45, Cx47). Overall, these findings provide essential molecular and functional insights into the mechanisms governing Cx36 GJ formation and partner specificity, paving the way for future therapeutic approaches targeting connexin dysfunction in human diseases.

">Sound source history warps perceived azimuth and elevation</a></h4>

              
                In real-world auditory localization, humans make decisions based on acoustic cues that reach the ear as well as from expectations of where the sound may originate. Past studies have shown that the auditory system makes rapid adjustments in response to changes in the statistics of recent stimulation, which help maintain sensitivity over the range where most stimuli occur. In the current study, we explored the auditory system's adaptability and plasticity by presenting sounds in different spatial contexts and examined the subsequent effects on sound localization accuracy. Identical sounds were rendered at different azimuth and elevation ranges of [-15{degrees}, -30{degrees}, 0{degrees}] or [15{degrees}, 30{degrees}, 0{degrees}] presented in contextual blocks. Sounds presented at 0{degrees} azimuth exhibited a rightward shift in perception when the targets were blocked within the left hemispace, and a leftward shift when targets were blocked in the right hemispace. Sounds that were blocked in the bottom hemispace showed an upward bias in perceived elevation, although the reverse was not found to be significant. Furthermore, participants who showed more errors in overall localization showed a higher degree of bias. Our results corroborate the account that the mapping of auditory space is dynamic and shifts depending on the context in which sounds are presented.

">Individual Differences in Training Naive Listeners to Localize Spatial Audio in Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                It has been widely believed that a key factor in creating realistic spatial audio in virtual reality (VR) is the head-related transfer function (HRTF), which is unique to each individual, but costly to measure for widespread use. This study investigates the effects of HRTF personalization and training on sound localization accuracy in VR. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 compared naive listeners and those who underwent brief training on localization tasks using personalized versus generic HRTFs; Experiment 2 used a within-subject design to assess training effects over two sessions. Results show that accurately localizing sound can be a difficult task for many participants the first time. Training significantly improves localization accuracy, reducing errors and confusions, and enabling many initially non-sensitive listeners to perceive spatial audio effectively. Although HRTF personalization yielded a statistically significant benefit, the effect was small, primarily improving elevation perception at extreme angles. These findings suggest that generic HRTFs combined with user training may suffice for most VR applications.

">Human-like individual differences emerge from random weight initializations in neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Much of AI research targets the behavior of an average human, a focus that traces to Turing's imitation game. Yet, no two human individuals behave exactly alike. In this study, we show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with different random initializations exhibit substantial individual differences that resemble those in humans. Using a large dataset (N = 60) of human responses (accuracy, confidence, & response time) in a digit recognition task, we trained multiple instances of three ANN architectures on the same task, creating as many ANN instances as human subjects. We found that these ANN instances vary significantly from one another. Critically, ANN instances showed consistent variation in their alignment with specific human subjects. This consistency in alignment between ANN instances and humans extended across behavioral metrics, indicating that an ANN instance mimicking an individual on one metric also does so on others. Finally, we showed that leveraging these alignments improves predictions of individual human responses. Our findings highlight the potential of ANNs to capture human variability, opening new directions to develop models that go beyond aligning the average human and instead aligning the idiosyncratic behavior of specific individuals.

">Active Sampling and Sex Differences in Perceptual Decision Making in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Decisions are typically viewed as arising from a sequential process: perception, decision, and then action. However, an alternative perspective, drawing from ecological psychology and embodied cognition, suggests that perception, decision, and action are interconnected in a cycle. Perception is an active process where information is gathered from the environment through actions that sample task stimuli. The sampling behavior of an animal reflects its internal state and serves as inputs that influence the decision-making process. To examine this framework, we trained rats on a visual stimulus detection task with three luminance levels. Our findings indicated that the time rats spent actively sampling the stimuli correlated with their success in detection, regardless of the cue's luminance. Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) showed that cue luminance primarily affected the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), while active sampling specifically influenced the decision threshold. These results suggest that perceptual decisions are reliant on active cue sampling, supporting the notion that actions and decisions are co-regulated. We also identified significant sex differences: female rats spent more time sampling the cues than male rats. Additionally, males took longer to act after making errors, possibly due to less efficient sampling behavior. These performance differences were linked to negative influences of sampling time on drift rates in females, but not in males. This divergence in the relationship between active sampling and DDM parameters is further support for a sex difference in choice impulsivity.

">Expression of Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the dorsolateral striatum is critical for the temporal coordination of acetylcholine and dopamine, and motor learning.</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are key modulators of adult neurocircuits, balancing their sensitivity to both excitation and inhibition, and fine-tuning fast neurotransmitter action under physiological conditions. We found that the mono-carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can take part in producing and/or processing of several neuroactive peptides in the mammalian brain and is best known for converting the pro-inflammatory peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) to the stress-ameliorating and neuro-protective peptide angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), is broadly expressed in the striatum. Cholinergic interneurons (CIN) of the striatum, known to express multiple peptide receptors also co-expressed the corresponding and functionally opposing receptors angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) for Ang II and mas receptor (MasR) for Ang 1-7 . Accordingly, the conditional, semi acute ablation and/or local pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 increased the frequency of acetylcholine (ACh) bursts, reduced the amplitude of dopamine (DA)-modulated pausing of CIN activity, and disrupted the temporal coordination of extracellular levels of ACh and DA during burst events. Further, ablation of ACE2 in the DLS biased directional movement and impaired motor skill learning. Co-injection of the AT1R inhibitor losartan and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonist quinpirole reduced steady state level cholinergic activity in an additive manner, and proximity ligation supported close spatial association of AT1R and D2R on CINs. Together our study provides evidence that striatal produced ACE2 impinges on the dynamics of ACh and DA and impacts action selection and motor learning through functional and structural interactions of peptidergic and dopaminergic signaling on CIN.

">Relative-location tuning in five frontal areas in a rhesus monkey</a></h4>

              
                Primates exhibit remarkable flexibility in coordinating gaze angle, spatial attention, and motor goals, such as fixating on one point, attending to another, and planning a reach toward a third. Neuronal reference frames are critical for these behaviors. We investigated relative-location tuning in macaque monkeys, where the reference frame was defined by the relative positions of two objects in a scene rather than their absolute coordinates. Single neurons were recorded from five frontal cortex regions: dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd and PMv), supplementary motor area (SMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFdl), and frontal eye field (FEF). In each trial, the monkey viewed two food pellets, one in a stationary feeder and another in a feeder attached to a moving robot, which served as an attention attractor. By task rule, the monkey could obtain only one pellet. A significant proportion of neurons in all five regions showed spatial tuning based on the relative positions of the two feeders (~35-65%, depending on the area). For instance, some neurons were more active when one feeder was positioned to the right of the other. In PFdl and FEF, most relative-location neurons primarily encoded the monkey fixation on the relatively left or right feeder. In SMA, PMd, and PMv, some neurons reflected fixation, but more encoded whether the relatively left or right feeder was the attention attractor (independent of gaze) or the reach target. Relative-location tuning was more prevalent when both feeders were task-relevant, such as when the monkey attended to one feeder while planning a reach to the other. Relative-location neurons could contribute to computing object-based reference frames or allocating spatial information-processing resources across attentional, oculomotor, and skeletomotor behaviors. They also suffice to explain gaze-dependent reach-related activity without contradicting theories of visually guided reaching, which predict gaze invariance.

">VDAC activation inhibits hippocampal plasticity via NLRP3 inflammasome & caspase-1: modulation by allopregnanolone enantiomers</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are the most abundant proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and key regulators of mitochondrial function under physiological and pathological conditions. These channels are modulated by multiple agents and are known binding sites for neuroactive steroids (NAS) including allopregnanolone (AlloP). Using erastin, an agent that promotes VDAC activation by preventing inhibition by tubulin, we assessed the impact of VDAC activation on hippocampal function. Brief erastin administration had no effect on basal transmission but completely inhibited induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of rat hippocampal slices. This LTP inhibition was prevented by VBIT-4, an agent that inhibits VDAC oligomerization. VDAC-mediated LTP inhibition was also prevented by inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, downstream effectors of VDACs, but not by inhibition of cGAS-STING, narrowing the neuroinflammatory pathways involved. Similarly, effects of erastin were prevented by AlloP and at lower concentrations by its unnatural enantiomer (ent-AlloP), an agent that unlike AlloP has little effect on GABAA receptors. Erastin also inhibited memory formation in a hippocampal-dependent form of one-trial learning and these effects were prevented by VBIT-4 and ent-AlloP, but not by a non-sedating dose of AlloP. These results have relevance for understanding the role of VDACs as mediators of neuronal stress and for the further development of NAS as neurotherapeutics and modulators of cellular stress.

While this paradigm has been shown to be associated with epigenetic de-aging, the dynamics of this process have remained unclear. Here, we used overexpression of the two reprogramming factors SOX2 and cMYC to generate iNSC from erythroid progenitors of donors ranging from neonatal to 101 years of age. Using an epigenetic clock algorithm, we corroborated our previous finding that iNSCs generated from aged donors show pronounced epigenetic de-aging, preserving around 13 % and 5 % of the original donor age at low and high passages, respectively. Studying the dynamic of epigenetic de-aging during iNSC conversion across time, we found that this process is largely protracted, continuing for several weeks and even beyond forced neuronal differentiation of iNSCs. Transcriptomic differences between young and old donor-derived iNSCs dissipate with extended time in conversion, too. Concordant with this observation, established iNSC lines lack age-associated cellular hallmarks, similar to induced pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. Interestingly, time course analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data revealed that acquisition of a bona fide NSC signature extends greatly beyond the time point when proliferative PAX6-positive iNSCs emerge. The unexpected slow dynamics of these processes makes iNSC conversion an attractive model for dissecting the mechanisms underlying somatic transdifferentiation and de-aging.

">Influence of STDP rule choice and network connectivity on polychronous groups and cell ensembles in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Spike-timing dependent plasticity plays an important role in how biological neural networks modify themselves with experience. However, the relationship between STDP and memory is not fully understood. Previously, an important advancement in understanding the relationship between spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and memory was made through cortical simulations. The proposed memory items, polychronous groups (PGs), combined the network anatomy with precise spike-timing relationships between the connected cells of the network. However, there are some challenges with this previous work. It is unclear how different STDP rules would impact the PG results and if the PG results are complementary with purely spike-pattern defined memory items called cell ensembles (CEs). Lastly, it is unclear how these results are affected by changes in network connectivity. We address these challenges by comparing the PGs and CEs detected in spiking neural network simulations of cortical and hippocampal CA1 networks with two different STDP rule implementations. We show that the PG and CE results differ greatly for the two different STDP rules and for the cortical and CA1 networks. Our results show an important disconnect between anatomically defined and spike-pattern defined memories in spiking neural network simulations illustrating that care must be taken when drawing conclusions on the relationship between STDP and memory in simulation studies.

">Multi-Class Classification of Cannabis and Alcohol Use Disorder: Identifying Common and Substance-Specific Neural Circuits.</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning approaches have advanced the identification of neural signatures of substance use, particularly through case-control comparisons and network-level analyses. However, most studies have focused on single substances in isolation, making it difficult to directly compare shared and distinct network computations and limiting their generalizability, given that many individuals engage in polysubstance use. Here, we introduce an explainable, connectivity-based multiclass classification framework that models distributed brain network organization to delineate both shared and substance-specific mechanisms of addiction. This design enables direct comparison among cannabis users, alcohol users, and controls, revealing network computations that uniquely differentiate each group. Using functional connectivity features from cue-induced craving tasks, we classified cannabis users (n=166), alcohol users (n=101), and healthy controls (n=238), achieving high out-of-sample accuracy (87% for cannabis, 69% for alcohol, and 73% for controls). Functional connectivity-based models consistently outperformed activation-based models, highlighting the importance of inter-regional network properties for biomarker development. Network analysis further revealed dorsal prefrontal, cingulate, and precuneus hubs consistent with meta-analytic craving networks and substance-specific connectivity motifs enhanced prefrontal coupling in cannabis users and greater insular-striatal integration in alcohol users. These results demonstrate that distinct network configurations define different substance-use profiles, advancing interpretable biomarkers for addiction neuroscience.

">Visual representations in the human brain rely on a reference frame that is in between allocentric and retinocentric coordinates</a></h4>

              
                Visual information in our everyday environment is anchored to an allocentric reference frame - a tall building remains upright even when you tilt your head, which changes the projection of the building on your retina from a vertical to a diagonal orientation. Does retinotopic cortex represent visual information in an allocentric or retinocentric reference frame? Here, we investigate which reference frame the brain uses by dissociating allocentric and retinocentric reference frames via a head tilt manipulation combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Nineteen participants completed between 1728-2880 trials during which they briefly viewed (150 ms) and then remembered (1500 ms) a randomly oriented target grating. In interleaved blocks of trials, the participant's head was either kept upright, or tilted by 45 degee using a custom rotating chinrest. The target orientation could be decoded throughout the trial (using both voltage and alpha-band signals) when training and testing within head-upright blocks, and within head-tilted blocks. Importantly, we directly addressed the question of reference frames via cross-generalized decoding: If target orientations are represented in a retinocentric reference frame, a decoder trained on head-upright trials would predict a 45 degree offset in decoded orientation when tested on head-tilted trials (after all, a vertical building becomes diagonal on the retina after head tilt). Conversely, if target representations are allocentric and anchored to the real world, no such offset should be observed. Our analyses reveal that from the earliest stages of perceptual processing all the way throughout the delay, orientations are represented in between an allocentric and retinocentric reference frame. These results align with previous findings from physiology studies in non-human primates, and are the first to demonstrate that the human brain does not rely on a purely allocentric or retinocentric reference frame when representing visual information.

">Differential encoding of noxious heat and self-reported pain along corticospinal networks: a simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain poses a substantial public health burden. Elucidating how the healthy central nervous system (CNS) differentially encodes objective stimulus intensity and subjective experiences of pain perception may offer key insights into the central mechanisms contributing to chronic pain. Functional MRI (fMRI) combined with controlled noxious stimulation provides a powerful means to explore neural representations of nociception and pain perception. Here, we applied noxious heat at three intensities (46 {degrees}C, 47 {degrees}C, 48 {degrees}C, 8 trials each randomized) to the right forearm of 28 healthy women during simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI to investigate how distributed corticospinal activity and connectivity encode stimulus intensity and subjective pain. Activity increased with stimulus temperature across regions involved in pain processing--including somatosensory, motor, prefrontal, insular, and subcortical areas--as well as in the ipsilateral dorsal and ventral spinal cord. Spinal-brain functional connectivity was observed between the right dorsal horn and pain-related brain regions such as primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and was positively associated with individual pain ratings. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that multivoxel activation patterns in the brain and spinal cord, as well as corticospinal connectivity patterns, reliably tracked stimulus temperature, while only subsets of cortical regions (e.g., insula, sensorimotor, and frontal cortices) encoded subjective pain. Notably, spinal cord representations were primarily organized by stimulus temperature rather than perceived pain intensity. These findings demonstrate that simultaneous spinal cord-brain fMRI combined with multivariate modeling can identify sensory and perceptual components of nociceptive processing across the neuroaxis. Such approaches advance mechanistic understanding of pain and may inform the development of CNS-based biomarkers for chronic pain assessment and intervention.

">Unfolding the Black Box of Recurrent Neural Networks for Path Integration</a></h4>

              
                Path integration is essential for spatial navigation. Experimental studies have identified neural correlates for path integration, but exactly how the neural system accomplishes this computation remains unresolved. Here, we adopt recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to perform a path integration task to explore this issue. After training, we borrow neuroscience prior knowledge and methods to unfold the black box of the trained model, including: clarifying neuron types based on their receptive fields, dissecting information flows between neuron groups by pruning their connections, and analyzing internal dynamics of neuron groups using the attractor framework. Intriguingly, we uncover a hierarchical information processing pathway embedded in the RNN model, along which velocity information of an agent is first forwarded to band cells, band and grid cells then coordinate to carry out path integration, and finally grid cells output the agent location. Inspired by the RNN-based study, we construct a neural circuit model, in which band cells form one-dimensional (1D) continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) and serve as upstream neurons to support downstream grid cells to carry out path integration in the 2D space. Our study challenges the conventional view of considering grid cells as the principal velocity integrator, and supports a neural circuit model with the hierarchy of band and grid cells.

">PEX11β-mediated improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction restores behavioral defect and cellular viability in neuropathological conditions</a></h4>

              
                Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 beta (Pex11{beta}) is a key regulator of peroxisome proliferation, functioning in coordination with mitochondrial fission proteins. Recent human proteome co-regulation mapping has revealed a distinctive co-expression pattern between Pex11{beta} and components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex at the peroxisome-mitochondria interface. In neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mitochondrial dysfunction is primarily associated with impairments in the respiratory chain complexes, particularly Complex II. However, the role of Pex11{beta} in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in these two disease conditions remains largely unexplored. In this study, using both in vitro and in vivo models, we identify Pex11{beta} as a critical modulator of mitochondrial dynamics, influencing the balance between fission and fusion. Through targeted knockdown and overexpression experiments, we demonstrate a direct link between Pex11{beta} level and mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated by transcriptional dysregulation of nuclear-encoded Complex II and mitochondrial fusion genes. Restoration of Pex11{beta} expression, along with Complex II and fusion gene level in striatal brain via a peroxisome proliferator and chemical chaperone, significantly alleviates motor and cognitive deficits in 3-NP-induced HD mouse model indicating better mitochondrial health in striatal brain. Furthermore, in silico analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a critical transcription factor governing the co -expression of Pex11{beta} and Complex II genes. This establishes a novel transcriptional axis that orchestrates inter organellar communication. Collectively, our findings position Pex11{beta} as a pivotal mediator of mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics, linking mitochondrial morphology and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to behavioural outcomes, and offering mechanistic insights relevant to amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

">Fingerprint-Based Explainable Machine Learning for Predicting Blood--Brain Barrier Permeability</a></h4>

              
                Predicting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is essential for early central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery, yet reliable computational screening remains challenging. This study presents a gradient-boosted ensemble framework trained on precomputed molecular fingerprints to classify compounds as BBB-permeable (BBB+) or non-permeable (BBB-). The 2048-bit fingerprints encode substructural information relevant to passive diffusion without requiring explicit physicochemical descriptors. The model, trained on experimentally annotated BBB datasets using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, achieved strong predictive performance (cross-validated ROC-AUC = 0.897 +/- 0.019; validation ROC-AUC = 0.932). External testing on literature-reported CNS-active compounds (Caffeine, Diazepam, Dopamine, and Levodopa) confirmed biological consistency: highly lipophilic drugs were predicted as BBB+, while polar molecules dependent on carrier-mediated transport were predicted as BBB-. The fingerprint-based model thus captures underlying permeability mechanisms through data-driven substructure learning. This approach eliminates the need for handcrafted descriptors while preserving interpretability through feature-importance analysis, establishing a reproducible, efficient, and explainable baseline for virtual BBB permeability screening in CNS drug development.

">Neural control of coordinated wing and leg movements during a terrestrial threat display</a></h4>

              
                Threat displays are a common form of social communication. In flying species, such displays often involve stereotypical, choreographed wing and leg movements. How the brain coordinates characteristic movements of these appendages to transmit social signals is poorly understood. In male Drosophila, threat displays flexibly combine wing displays with rapid turns and charges. Here we identify two brain modules downstream of a superordinate threat command center. Each contains two neurons that combinatorially generate threat-specific appendicular movements: one comprises two descending neurons synergistically controlling wing threat; the other contains two interneurons that antagonistically control turns and charges. Within-module neuronal coactivation evokes appendage-specific actions recapitulating those evoked by the upstream center. These data uncover a hierarchical combinatorial circuit that coordinates wing and leg movements during a terrestrial social display. More generally, our findings identify an instantiation of a Tinbergenian hierarchical behavioral control system for social communication and reveal a novel underlying implementation logic.

">Dual Inhibitors Targeting G9a and GSK-3B: Translational Perspectives on Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic dysregulation and abnormal kinase signaling are key factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet no existing treatment targets both. We introduce a dual-targeting strategy that inhibits the histone methyltransferase G9a and the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3B;-two synergistic drivers of neurodegeneration-using a single CNS-penetrant small molecule. This report covers the rational design, synthesis, and preclinical testing of T2 as a new therapeutic candidate. Structure-based pharmacophore modeling and medicinal chemistry refinement led to a focused library of dual inhibitors, with T2 standing out due to its balanced potency against both targets, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, low off-target effects, and a favorable safety profile. In the SAMP8 mouse model of late-onset AD, T2 markedly improved memory, restored social behaviors, and increased synaptic complexity. Molecular studies showed that T2 treatment lowered tau phosphorylation, the AB;42/40 ratio, and neurofilament light chain levels, while boosting neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory pathways. Multi-omics analyses indicated that T2 causes widespread transcriptional and proteomic changes, activating synaptic plasticity genes (like Arc and Nectin3), reducing ferroptosis and senescence-related pathways, and altering chromatin accessibility. Electrophysiological tests confirmed the restoration of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Overall, these results support dual G9a/GSK-3B; inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach for AD, with T2 emerging as a strong candidate for further therapeutic development.

                The Na,K-ATPase (NKA) plays a fundamental role in neuronal excitability by maintaining ionic gradients and contributing to electrogenic resting currents. Among its isoforms, the neuron-specific a3 subunit exhibits a uniquely low affinity for intracellular Na, weak voltage dependence, and slightly reduced ATP sensitivity compared to the ubiquitous a1. Although mutations in ATP1A3 are known to cause severe neurological disorders, the specific kinetic features of a3 that underlie its functional specialization remain incompletely understood. Here we employed biophysically detailed models of stretch receptor neurons, grounded in patch-clamp recordings of the a3-isoform current and spiking responses, to dissect the contribution of isoform-specific pump kinetics to firing behavior. Substitution of a1 for a3 abolished the ability to sustain long spike trains and reduced high-frequency entrainment, whereas a3-preserved prolonged discharges and faithful responses to vibratory stimuli. Remarkably, even halved pump density a3 50% preserved superior excitability compared to mixed expression (a 50%/a1 50%), indicating that kinetic profile rather than pump quantity determines firing capacity. Hybrid models revealed that Na; affinity is the decisive factor: retaining the low Na; affinity of a3 preserved excitability, while introducing a1-like voltage or ATP dependence produced only minor effect on simulated neuron discharge. These findings establish a mechanistic explanation for the selective expression of a3 in muscle spindle afferents and other neurons with high-frequency demands, and help to explain why a1 cannot compensate in ATP1A3-linked diseases. More broadly, they highlight the principle that isoform specialization of the NKA is not redundant but tuned to the discharge requirements of distinct neuronal populations.

">Phosphoproteomic profiling reveals post-translational dysregulation in Huntington's disease patient-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although transcriptomic and proteomic changes have been characterized in patient-derived neurons, the contribution of post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, remains poorly understood. Here, we present the first phosphoproteomic analysis by mass spectrometry (P-MS) of human induced neurons (iNs) directly reprogrammed from HD patient fibroblasts. We identified 177 phosphopeptides with significantly altered abundance in HD-iNs, mapping to phosphoproteins associated with key signaling pathways known to be affected in HD, such as splicing and autophagy. By integrating P-MS data with previously published proteomic and transcriptomic data from the same donors, we identified distinct subsets of ON-OFF phosphopeptides that exhibited a complete loss of phosphorylation in either HD- or Ctrl-iNs, without corresponding changes at the RNA or protein level. An exception was MXRA8, previously described in glial cells as a mediator of blood-brain barrier integrity and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. This protein showed increased protein abundance despite the absence of phosphorylation in HD-iNs, suggesting a compensatory mechanism - a pattern also observed in human post mortem cortical HD tissue. Additionally, MXRA8 showed altered protein-protein interactions with lysosomal and metabolic regulators in HD-iNs, highlighting its potential role in autophagy impairment as well as in neurovascular dysfunction. These findings uncover a distinct layer of post-translational dysregulation in HD, suggesting that phospho-switch proteins such as MXRA8 may be candidate effectors of pathology and thus site-specific phosphorylation loss may contribute to impaired signaling and proteostasis in human HD neurons.

">Visual working memory-related saccade biases are amplified by task demands, without updating working memory content</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (VWM) and oculomotor control exert bi-directional influences on each other: eye movements during memory delays can influence VWM performance, and VWM content can bias the execution of eye movements. Oculomotor capture has been shown to extend to automatic, corrective saccades that can be biased towards distractors whose feature matches VWM content. We address the question of bi-directional influences between VWM and the oculomotor system, here with a focus on corrective saccade biases. 20 participants had to memorize a color hue and later discriminate it from another hue from a different (Easy condition) or the same color category (Difficult condition). Between encoding and test, they performed a gaze-contingent saccade task where, mid-saccade, the position of items shifted, introducing an artificial saccade error, and the color of a distractor neighboring the target changed to a color (mis)matching the memorized one. VWM performance was higher in the Easy compared to the Difficult experimental block, reflecting the successful manipulation of task demands. Corrective saccade biases towards the distractor occurred more frequently when it matched memory content compared to when it did not, replicating previous findings. Importantly, they also occurred more in the Difficult experimental block, which required stronger VWM representations than the Easy condition. VWM performance, however, was not affected by saccade corrections to memory (mis)matching distractors. Our results provided no evidence of saccade biases having a role in the updating of VWM content, however they indicate an influence of task demands and VWM engagement on automatic oculomotor biases.

">Distinct response selectivity changes in primary visual and parietal cortex during visual discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                When animals learn the behavioral relevance of sensory features, response selectivity in primary sensory areas increases for those features. However, the effect of learning on neuronal activity in higher-level areas associated with decision-making in the parietal cortex, compared to primary sensory cortex, is not yet known. We used two-photon calcium imaging to determine how learning modifies neural representations in primary visual cortex (V1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in a visual go/no-go orientation discrimination task. We found that behavior improvements after learning were associated with increased neuronal selectivity in both V1 and PPC. The increased selectivity in PPC was mainly driven by neurons preferring the rewarded go stimulus, while, in V1, neurons increased their selectivity for both the rewarded go and unrewarded no-go stimulus. Furthermore, feature preference was robust in V1 neurons but reorganized in PPC after learning. Finally, feature preference was preserved across contexts in V1 but not in PPC after learning, where many neurons switched their preference to the rewarded feature during active task engagement. Our results demonstrate that learning a visually-guided discrimination task increased information about relevant sensory features through distinct changes in the bottom and top levels of the visual cortical hierarchy. Visual cortex neurons encode visual features with increased reliability but with preserved feature preferences, while parietal neurons reorganize their feature preferences in a task-specific manner.

">Ketamine strengthens synaptic inputs to the dorsal raphe to boost serotonergic activity: pivotal for rapid antidepressant-like effects</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine at subanaesthetic dose is known as a fast-acting antidepressant (AD), able to facilitate synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the hippocampus. However, its influence on the serotonergic (5-HT) system is more confusing as it loses its behavioral effects in 5-HT-depleted animals, but does not modify 5-HT neuron function. We hypothesized that this discrepancy was due to the different temporal scales chosen in the related studies. We performed electrophysiological recordings of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and microdialysis measurements of 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Experiments were designed to collect the results over a long duration, i.e. 4-5 hours after the injection. Levels of the pro-neuroplastic factors PSD-95 and Synapsin-1 in the DRN were also assessed, as was cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG). 5-HT neuron mean firing rate was unmodified within the 2 h that followed ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), but strongly (90%) increased in the 2-5 h time bin, an effect abolished by lesioning the mPFC or administering the mTOR inhibitor Torin-2. A similar kinetics was found for hippocampal 5-HT release. Synapsin-1 and PSD-95 mRNA transcriptions were enhanced at 2 h, and PSD-95 protein levels appeared to peak at 24 h. Finally, DG mitogenesis was enhanced 48 h post-injection, an augmentation suppressed in 5-HT-depleted animals. Low-dose ketamine provokes a neuroplastic wave originating in the mPFC and emerging in the hippocampus, a transfer in which the 5-HT system appears to act as an integrative hub of plasticity.

">Butyrate regulates the blood-brain barrier transport and intra-endothelial accumulation of Alzheimers disease Amyloid-beta peptides</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the pathological deposition of amyloid beta (A) proteins as amyloid plaques, tau aggregates, and cerebrovascular dysfunction that drive disease progression. Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway. These changes may also improve the integrity of BBB tight junctions by increasing claudin-5 expression and extracellular matrix, and by upregulating TIMP-2 expression. This study highlights butyrate's potential as a therapeutic modulator of AD-related BBB dysfunction.

">Stress drives the hippocampus to prioritize statistical prediction over episodic encoding</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a critical role in encoding individual experiences into episodic memory, while also detecting patterns shared across these experiences that allow us to anticipate future events via statistical learning. Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Slow waves are the main oscillatory activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep, playing a crucial role in synaptic homeostasis, memory consolidation, and cortical network regulation. In urethane-anesthetized rodents, frequently used in long-term potentiation experiments in vivo, brain activity alternates between a deactivated state, dominated by slow waves, and an activated state characterized by faster oscillations. However, the interplay between synaptic plasticity and slow wave dynamics within these fluctuating brain states remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether long-term potentiation in the hippocampal–medial prefrontal cortex (CA1-mPFC) circuit, critical for memory processing, modulates cortical slow wave dynamics during urethane anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of CA1 robustly evoked a transient (50 to 200 ms) event of population silence (down states) in the medial prefrontal cortex, which emerged after the typical evoked field post-synaptic potential, and was consistently associated with a slow waves. Importantly, long-term potentiation induction significantly enhanced the CA1-evoked medial prefrontal cortex down states and slowed spontaneous cortical slow wave oscillations, without altering the activated/deactivated brain state proportion. Our findings provide direct evidence of an interaction between synaptic plasticity and cortical slow wave dynamics, laying the groundwork for future studies on the underlying mechanisms of state-dependent synaptic homeostasis.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is a longitudinally extended brain structure characterized by its classic trisynaptic circuit, comprising the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subregions, evident in transverse slices and consistent throughout the hippocampal formation. Traditionally, the hippocampal circuit's intrinsic features have been studied using transverse slices. However, the trisynaptic flow extends beyond the transverse plane; Schaffer collaterals, the excitatory projections from CA3 to CA1, also extend along the longitudinal (septotemporal) axis. Despite the anatomical establishment of Schaffer collaterals' longitudinal projection, its physiological properties remain underexplored. In this study, we recorded the transverse and longitudinal transmission of Schaffer collaterals using photostimulation with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression. Our results revealed that optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs) were significantly smaller in distal CA1 compared to proximal CA1, while optically evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) remained consistent along the longitudinal axis. Additionally, CA1 interneurons mediating feedforward inhibition received smaller oEPSCs in distal planes. These findings indicate that Schaffer collaterals transmit excitatory signals more effectively than inhibitory signals along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus.</p>

">Relationships between phenotypic differences in punishment behaviour and prefrontal cortex network engagement</a></h4>

              
                Avoiding actions with negative consequences is fundamental to adaptive behaviour, yet individuals differ drastically in their tendencies to avoid to punishment. Using a conditioned punishment task in male and female rats, we replicate findings of a bimodal distribution of punishment avoidance, and identify four distinct behavioural phenotypes (Sensitive, Hypersensitive, Insensitive, Generalised) that differed in their punishment avoidance, unpunished reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We examined how these phenotypic differences related to c-Fos (transcriptional activity marker) across prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. While region-level c-Fos differences were minimal, covariance and graph-theoretic analyses revealed three functional PFC networks predominantly composed of medial PFC, ventrolateral PFC, or sensorimotor regions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC network predicted punishment avoidance, while activity in the medial PFC network predicted generalised suppression during initial punishment learning. These findings suggest phenotypic differences in punishment sensitivity is underpinned by differential recruitment of distinct cortical networks that drive adaptive versus maladaptive responses to negative outcomes.

                <p>Although clinical and experimental evidence highlight the role of the thalamus in voluntary movement production, the involvement of the thalamus in complex motor tasks such as speech production remains to be elucidated. The present study examined neural activity within the bilateral thalamus in 13 participants (seven females) with essential tremor undergoing awake deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, using three speech tasks of varied complexity [vowel vocalization, a diadochokinetic task (DDK), and sentence repetition]. Low-frequency neural activity (delta/theta band) activity was significantly increased during sentence and DDK compared with vowel vocalization in the bilateral motor thalamus and, to a lesser extent, increased for sentence repetition compared with DDK. Moreover, there was prominent prespeech beta band activity, with a greater decrease in the power of beta activity for sentence compared with DDK and vowel vocalization. The greater low-frequency activity in more complex speech tasks may reflect the allocation of additional cognitive resources to monitor the execution of speech motor plans through cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical pathways in a temporally precise manner. The greater decrease in the power of beta activity prior to the onset of sentence repetition may imply greater involvement of the bilateral thalamus in the planning of complex speech tasks. These findings provide new insights into the role of the bilateral thalamus in speech production and may have clinical implications for neurological disorders that affect speech production.</p>

                <p>Aberrant dopamine transmission is a hallmark of several psychiatric disorders. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display distinct activity states that are regulated by discrete afferent inputs. For example, burst firing requires excitatory input from the mesopontine tegmentum, while dopamine neuron population activity, defined as the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons, is thought to be dependent on inhibitory drive from the ventral pallidum (VP). Rodent models used to study psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, consistently exhibit elevated dopamine neuron population activity, due to decreased tonic inhibition from the VP. However, it remains unclear whether the VP can modulate all dopamine neurons or if only a specific subset of VTA dopamine neurons receive innervation from the VP to be recruited as required. This knowledge is critical for understanding dopamine regulation in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology in male and female rats to record VTA dopamine neurons inhibited by electrical stimulation of the VP. Specifically, VP stimulation inhibited ~22% of spontaneously active dopamine neurons; however, activation of the ventral hippocampus, a modulator of VTA population activity, increased the proportion to ~48%. This increase suggests that VP selectively modulates a subset of dopamine neurons that can be recruited by afferent activation. Anterograde monosynaptic tracing revealed that approximately half of the VTA dopamine neurons receive input from the VP. Taken together, we demonstrate that a subset of VTA dopamine neurons receives monosynaptic input from the VP, providing valuable information regarding the regulation of VTA neuron activity.</p>

                <p>by Jeremy Charlier, Zeinab Sherkatghanad, Vladimir Makarenkov</p>

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive accuracy in complex tasks, particularly in scenarios where data is limited or imbalanced. This study explores the use of similarity-based pre-evaluation as a methodology to identify optimal source datasets for transfer learning, addressing the dual challenge of efficient source-target dataset pairing and off-target prediction in CRISPR-Cas9, while existing transfer learning applications in the field of gene editing often lack a principled method for source dataset selection. We use cosine, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances to evaluate similarity between the source and target datasets used in our transfer learning experiments. Four deep learning network architectures, i.e. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and two traditional machine learning models, i.e. Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), were tested and compared in our simulations. The results suggest that similarity scores are reliable indicators for pre-selecting source datasets in CRISPR-Cas9 transfer learning experiments, with cosine distance proving to be a more effective dataset comparison metric than either Euclidean or Manhattan distances. An RNN-GRU, a 5-layer FNN, and two MLP variants provided the best overall prediction results in our simulations. By integrating similarity-based source pre-selection with machine learning outcomes, we propose a dual-layered framework that not only streamlines the transfer learning process but also significantly improves off-target prediction accuracy.

                <p>by Hao Zhu, Donna K. Slonim</p>

A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of “dropout,” when some transcripts’ expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to improve resilience to zero inflation in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the “dropout” problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem. Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE.

                <p>by Fabiano Baroni, Ben D. Fulcher</p>

Neuronal activity is organized in collective patterns that are critical for information coding, generation, and communication between neural populations. These patterns are often described in terms of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships. Many methods have been proposed for the quantification of these collective states of dynamic neuronal organization. However, it is difficult to determine which method is best suited for which experimental setting and research question. This choice is further complicated by the fact that most methods are sensitive to a combination of synchrony, oscillations, and other factors; in addition, some of them display systematic biases that can complicate their interpretation. To address these challenges, we adopt a highly comparative approach, whereby spike trains are represented by a diverse library of measures. This enables unsupervised or supervised analysis in the space of measures, or in that of spike trains. We compile a battery of 122 measures of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships, complemented with 9 measures of spiking intensity and variability. We first apply them to sets of synthetic spike trains with known statistical properties, and show that all measures are confounded by extraneous factors such as firing rate or population frequency, but to different extents. Then, we analyze spike trains recorded in different species—rat, mouse, and monkey—and brain areas—primary sensory cortices and hippocampus—and show that our highly comparative approach provides a high-dimensional quantification of collective network activity that can be leveraged for both unsupervised and supervised characterization of firing patterns. Overall, the highly comparative approach provides a detailed description of the empirical properties of multineuron spike train analysis methods, including practical guidelines for their use in experimental settings, and advances our understanding of neuronal coordination and coding.

Proteins carry out cellular functions by changing their structure among a few conformations, each characterised by a different energy level. Therefore, structural changes, energy transformations, and protein function are intimately related. Despite its central importance, this relationship remains elusive. For example, while many hexameric ATPase motors are known to function using a hand-over-hand alternation of subunits, how energy transduction throughout the assembly structure drives the hand-over-hand mechanism is not known. In this work, we unravel the energetic basis of hand-over-hand in a model AAA+ motor, RuvB. To do so, we develop a general method to compute the residue-scale elastic pseudoenergy due to structure changes and apply it to RuvB structures, recently resolved through cryo-EM. This allows us to quantify how progression through RuvB’s mechanochemical cycle translates into residue-scale energy transduction. In particular, we find that DNA binding is associated with overcoming a high energy barrier. This is possible through inter-subunit transmission of energy, and ultimately driven by nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we show how this structure-inferred energetic quantification can be integrated into a non-equilibrium model of AAA+ assembly dynamics, consistent with single-molecule biophysics measurements. Overall, our work elucidates the energetic basis for the hand-over-hand mechanism in RuvB’s cycle. Furthermore, it presents a generally applicable methodology for studying the energetics of conformational cycles in other proteins, allowing to quantitatively bridge data from structural biology and single-molecule biophysics.

                <p>by Weifan Wang, Xueyan Niu, Liyuan Liang, Tai-Sing Lee</p>

A ubiquitous phenomenon observed along the ventral stream of the primate hierarchical visual system is the suppression of neural responses to familiar stimuli at the population level. The observation of the suppression of the neural response in the early visual cortex (V1 and V2) to familiar stimuli that are multiple times larger in size than the receptive fields of individual neurons implicates the plausible development of recurrent circuits for encoding these global stimuli. In this work, we investigated the neural mechanisms of familiarity suppression and showed that a recurrent neural circuit based on Hebbian learning, consisting of neurons with small and local receptive fields, can develop to encode specific global familiar stimuli robustly as a result of familiarity training. We proposed that the learned recurrent circuit implements a manifold transform. The recurrent circuit compresses the dimensions of nuisance variations of a familiar image in the neural response manifold relative to the dimensions for discriminating different familiar stimuli, resulting in increased robustness of the global stimulus representation against noise and other irrelevant perturbations. We demonstrate that a recurrent circuit implements the manifold transform using a mixed strategy of locally linear and globally nonlinear computations, where the local linear computation selectively redistributes recurrent gain to enhance concept discrimination. These results provide testable predictions for neurophysiological experiments.

                <p>by Huijuan Zhou, Jun Chen, Xianyang Zhang</p>

Microbiome sequencing data are inherently sparse and compositional, with excessive zeros arising from biological absence or insufficient sampling. These zeros pose significant challenges for downstream analyses, particularly those that require log-transformation. We introduce BMDD (BiModal Dirichlet Distribution), a novel probabilistic modeling framework for accurate imputation of microbiome sequencing data. Unlike existing imputation approaches that assume unimodal abundance, BMDD captures the bimodal abundance distribution of the taxa via a mixture of Dirichlet priors. It uses variational inference and a scalable expectation-maximization algorithm for efficient imputation. Through simulations and real microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that BMDD outperforms competing methods in reconstructing true abundances and improves the performance of differential abundance analysis. Through multiple posterior samples, BMDD enables robust inference by accounting for uncertainty in zero imputation. Our method offers a principled and computationally efficient solution for analyzing high-dimensional, zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data and is broadly applicable in microbial biomarker discovery and host-microbiome interaction studies.

                <p>by Etienne Gosselin, Sophie Bagur, Sara Jamali, Jean-Luc Puel, Jérôme Bourien, Brice Bathellier</p>

Early studies on orientation selectivity in the visual cortex have suggested that sensory systems generate new feature representations at specific processing stages. Many observations challenge this view, but in the absence of systematic, multistage measurements, the logic of how feature tuning emerges remains elusive. Here, using a generic approach based on representational similarity analysis with a noise-corrected population metric, we demonstrate in the mouse auditory system that feature representations evolve gradually with, in some cases, major, feature-specific improvements at particular stages. We observe that single frequency tuning is already fully developed in the cochlear nucleus, the first stage of processing, while tuning to higher-order features improves up to the auditory cortex, with major steps in the inferior colliculus for amplitude modulation frequency or noise bandwidth tuning and in the cortex for frequency modulation direction and for complex sound identity or direction. Moreover, we observe that intensity tuning is established in a feature-ependent manner, earlier for pure frequencies than for more complex sounds. This indicates that auditory feature computations are a mix of stepwise and gradual processes which together contribute to decorrelate sound representations.

                <p>by Robin Rondon, Théaud Hezez, Julien Richard Albert, Shinichiro Hayashi, Bernadette Drayton-Libotte, Gloria Gonzalez Curto, Frédéric Auradé, Elie Balloul, Claire Dugast-Darzacq, Frédéric Relaix, Pascale Gilardi-Hebenstreit, Vanessa Ribes</p>

Understanding how transcription factors regulate organized cellular diversity in developing tissues remains a major challenge due to their pleiotropic functions. We addressed this by monitoring and genetically modulating the activity of PAX3 and PAX7 during the specification of neural progenitor pools in the embryonic spinal cord. Using mouse models, we show that the balance between the transcriptional activating and repressing functions of these factors is modulated along the dorsoventral axis and is instructive to the patterning of spinal progenitor pools. By combining loss-of-function experiments with functional genomics in spinal organoids, we demonstrate that PAX-mediated repression and activation rely on distinct <i>cis-</i>regulatory genomic modules. This enables both the coexistence of their dual activity in dorsal cell progenitors and the specific control of two major differentiation programs. PAX promote H3K27me3 deposition at silencers to repress ventral identities, while at enhancers, they act as pioneer factors, opening and activating <i>cis-</i>regulatory modules to specify dorsal-most identities. Finally, we show that this pioneer activity is restricted to cells exposed to BMP morphogens, ensuring spatial specificity. These findings reveal how PAX proteins, modulated by morphogen gradients, orchestrate neuronal diversity in the spinal cord, providing a robust framework for neural subtype specification.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess whether their combination improves diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively analyzed 293 ALS patients, 85 neurodegenerative disease controls, and 29 healthy controls. A validation cohort of 501 ALS patients was analyzed to confirm reproducibility of the results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for sNfL, cTnT, and their combination, and the area under the curve (AUC) was compared across groups. An ALS-specific cTnT cut-off of 8.35ng/L was determined using the Youden index and applied in subgroup analyses, in which “biomarker-negative” ALS patients were compared to “biomarker-positive” patients regarding disease duration and progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sNfL showed excellent performance in discriminating ALS patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.94), but only moderate performance in discriminating neurodegenerative disease controls (AUC = 0.82). Combining sNfL and cTnT improved diagnostic accuracy for ALS over neurodegenerative controls, with an AUC of 0.90, whereas cTnT alone showed an AUC of 0.77. The validation cohort showed similar AUCs. “Biomarker-negative” ALS patients had a longer disease duration (73.0 vs 18.0 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0003) and a lower progression rate (0.19 vs 0.70 points per months, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than “biomarker-positive” patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although sNfL alone performs well in distinguishing ALS from healthy controls, repurposing cTnT for ALS provides additional value in discriminating ALS from disease controls. The combination of sNfL and cTnT improves diagnostic accuracy and may help identify prognostically distinct ALS subgroups. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Aim This study aims to compare the isokinetic strength of the Hamstrings against the Quadriceps for Football, Cricket, and Tennis among semi-professional athletes. Methodology An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with the inclusion of participants between 18-40 years, both males and females having an active athlete profile playing Football, Cricket, and Tennis as semi-professional (competing in inter-collegiate, national-level tournaments in the UAE). The minimum duration for each sport was one hour per day and three to five times per week. A total of 66 participants were enrolled, with 22 participants in each group. The ISOMOVE isokinetic device was used to assess the strength of dynamically contracting Quadriceps concentrically against eccentric contraction of the Hamstring muscles to determine the functional ratio (H/Q ratio). Results Age-wise distribution of players showed predominant male participants with 77.3% of players in Football, 68.2% in Cricket, and 59.1% in Tennis. The comparison for the mean peaks of isokinetic strength for functional ratio suggested a statistically significant difference between the three sports (Football p<0.001, Cricket p=0.006, Tennis p =0.003). The findings suggested that the highest H/Q ratio was found in Football players with a mean value of 0.51±0.07, followed by Cricket and Tennis with a mean of 0.48±0.08 and 0.42±0.05, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion The isokinetic strength testing for H/Q ratio was found to be higher in Football players, followed by Cricket and Tennis players for semi-professional athletes. The study concluded that the functional H/Q ratio varies between three similar sports as the demand on the target muscle would specifically vary. Thus, semi-professional players who play multiple games should consider enhancing FR for the Hamstring to the Quadriceps, besides the strength and training specific to sports, to avoid the risk of injuries.

                Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to HPV-related cancers such as cervical cancer and other cancers such as anal, vaginal, and penile cancer. HPV rarely produces symptoms and cannot be cured or treated; therefore, vaccination is essential to protect against HPV and HPV-related diseases. However, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter, respectfully, ‘Aboriginal’) people are not receiving their HPV vaccine dose, resulting in missed opportunities to be protected from HPV-related cancers. Health promotion is a critical way to empower people to take ownership over and control their health and is a core function of public health. One way to deliver health promotion is through social media platforms. In recent COVID-19 times, we have seen the effect of social media on public health messaging, both positive and harmful. In particular, Instagram influencers have had a profound impact on pro- and anti-vaccination messages. Aboriginal adolescents aged 13-15 years old have strong engagement with social media platforms. Combining co-created health promotion messages with local ‘micro-Influencers’ is a novel way to improve HPV vaccination rates. The overall aim of this project is to improve the rates of HPV vaccination amongst young Aboriginal people. We will achieve this through: i) co-creation of health promotion messages, ii) developing and delivering a social media campaign and iii) evaluating the effectiveness of the campaign through an interrupted time-series design. We hypothesise that the co-creation of health promotion messages with young Aboriginal people and their families and utilising the skills of micro-Influencers to engage and influence their followers will result in improvements HPV vaccination rates amongst this population.

                Background The use of ensemble learning has been crucial for improving predictive accuracy in healthcare, especially with regard to critical diagnostic and classification problems. Ensemble models combine the strengths of multiple ML models and reduce the risk of misclassification, which is important in healthcare, where accurate predictions impact patient outcomes. Methods This study introduces the Gradient-Based Weight Optimized Ensemble Model (GBWOEM), an advanced ensemble technique that optimizes the weights of five base models: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), through optimizing the weights. Two variants, GBWOEM-R (random weight initialization) and GBWOEM-U (uniform weight initialization), were proposed and tested on five healthcare-related datasets: breast cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, diabetic retinopathy debrecen, obesity level estimation based on physical condition and eating habits, and thyroid diseases. Results The test accuracy of the proposed models increased to 0.48-8.26% over the traditional ensemble models, such as Adaboost, Catboost, GradientBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Performance metrics, including ROC-AUC analyses, confirmed the model’s efficacy in handling imbalanced data, highlighting its potential for advancing predictive consistency in healthcare applications. Conclusion The GBWOEM model improves the predictive accuracy and offers a reliable solution for healthcare applications even when dealing with the imbalance data. This strategy has the potential to ensure patient outcomes and diagnostic consistency in healthcare settings.

                Zhang et al. reveal that BST2-positive border astrocytes regulate astrocyte-microglia interactions after stroke. Genetic or antibody blockade of BST2 reduces these interactions and improves early functional outcomes, highlighting BST2 as a therapeutic target for brain repair.

                This study isolates extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Biophysical and proteomic analyses demonstrate that sEVs and exomeres are distinctive entities. GALNS and MAN2B1 are identified as potential EM markers. HCC-derived EMs promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, cell cycle progression, and lipidomic dysregulation.

                Sethi et al. define a molecular role for the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler EP400, a core subunit of the NuA4 HAT complex, in preventing CENP-A mislocalization for chromosomal stability. Cells defective for EP400 function cause mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric regions in a DAXX-dependent manner, leading to CIN phenotypes.

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 24 October 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01783-1">doi:10.1038/s41566-025-01783-1</a></p>Performance of solid-state triplet fusion upconversion films is enhanced by surface plasmons, intensity threshold is reduced by a factor of 17 and external quantum efficiency is enhanced by a factor of 19. A white-emitting organic light-emitting diode featuring upconverted blue emission—rather than blue electroluminescence—is demonstrated, with a colour rendering index of up to 86.2.

                The epigenetic adaptation of innate immune cells to inflammatory stimuli, or trained immunity, represents an evolutionarily conserved feature of host defense. Recent advances have revealed that such adaptations can occur at the level of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in long-lasting epigenetic reprogramming of the immune system. However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these processes remains incomplete, limiting our capacity to predict or therapeutically manipulate the adaptive capacity of hematopoiesis. In this review, we survey the current literature to support a model of hematopoietic memory whose stimulus-specific nuances are shaped by specific cytokine environments and driven by the combinatorial activity of key transcription factors. Comparative analyses underscore the evolutionary conservation and essential biological roles of these factors, suggesting that trained immunity may reflect the strategic repurposing of ancient transcriptional programs for the purpose of enhancing host defense.

                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) interferes with the treatment of central nervous system disorders owing to the complexity of its structure and restrictive function. Thus, it is challenging to develop central nervous system drug delivery strategies. Specific mode electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation can effectively open the BBB in rats. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively map the cell population in the Sprague-Dawley rat cerebral cortex. We identified 23 cell subsets and eight types of cells in the brain by cell annotation. scRNA-seq revealed transcriptional changes in the cerebral cortex under EA. Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular and cellular modifications in the brain resulting from EA intervention and serve as a resource for drug delivery across healthy and diseased states. Innovative approaches to enhance BBB opening will lead to more effective therapeutic plans and enhanced drug delivery.

                Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is recognized as one of the key strategies to support culturally responsive and inclusive education. In the sections that follow, we draw upon current international literature and studies to identify approaches with respect to embedding Indigenous knowledge into TVET curricula - strategies and challenges; outcomes. Eighty-five peer-reviewed articles between 2020 and 2025 were reviewed according to PRISMA 2020, concentrating on pedagogical models and methods, curriculum construction process, community involvement and student performance. The outcomes reveal that effective integration is grounded on culturally relevant teaching resources and active engagement with indigenous communities, along with traditional knowledge systems coupling to technical skills. Some of the challenges involve institutionalized barriers, a lack of teacher training and resources can restrict the ways in which we see Indigenous perspectives incorporated in meaningful ways. Notwithstanding these obstacles, there is evidence that students who experience Indigenous knowledge in TVET display higher levels of cultural awareness and identity formation, and engagement with learning; their communities are more empowered to participate in education. The review emphasizes the necessity for an overall framework and policies supporting sustainable integration, and advises that long-term effects on employability, social inclusion and community development be investigated in future studies. By highlighting the importance of Indigenous knowledge in TVET, this study adds to discussions on culturally-responsive pedagogical practice and offers practical advice for educators, policy makers and researchers aiming to improve TVET practices across the world.

                In the contemporary digital landscape, social media platforms have radically reshaped consumer-brand interactions, with Instagram emerging as a pivotal channel for luxury brand marketing. This study investigates the adoption of luxury products through Instagram by integrating psychological, social, and demographic predictors with advanced analytical methodologies. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 205 respondents, we examine how Instagram engagement metrics—such as time spent on the platform, influencer marketing, sponsored advertisements, and interactive content—impact consumer adoption behaviours. Employing multiple statistical techniques including multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and path analysis, alongside machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and decision trees, we identify the primary drivers of purchase intention and brand trustworthiness in the luxury context. Notably, while surface-level engagement metrics show limited predictive power, factors such as brand trust, prestige, uniqueness, and personalized recommendations have strong influences on consumer purchase intention. The SVM model accurately predicts adoption likelihood with 87% accuracy, underscoring the efficacy of psychological and social variables as discriminators. Additionally, sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback reveals predominantly positive consumer attitudes toward Instagram marketing strategies. Our findings highlight the nuanced role of brand-related psychological constructs and demographic variables in shaping luxury product adoption, offering actionable insights for marketers aiming to optimize Instagram’s potential in luxury branding. This integrative approach advances both theoretical understanding and practical applications, reinforcing the importance of authenticity, emotional connection, and targeted psychographic segmentation in luxury digital marketing.

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. A total of 82 participants (41 cases and 41 controls) will be recruited. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024, during the Indonesia’s dry season. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                <p>Epileptic seizures involve the brain transitioning from a resting state to an abnormal state of synchronized bursting, akin to a bifurcation in dynamical systems where a parameter shift triggers a qualitative change in behavior. A comprehensive model was previously developed that used dynamical equations capable of simulating 16 "dynamotypes" of seizures that span the full range of theoretical first-order dynamics. The current work is a tool to understand and implement this model with the goal of generating a wide range of synthetic seizures. We present a dynamical atlas of all 16 possible onset&ndash;offset bifurcation combinations, each characterized by distinct features in simulated EEG-like recordings. We include a tutorial and graphical user interphase that generates diverse simulated seizures. In addition, we include methods to add realistic noise and filtering effects to enhance their resemblance to human EEG data. This toolbox has two purposes: it is a practical, educational demonstration of the dynamical principles underlying seizure bifurcations, and it provides the algorithms necessary to produce large numbers of realistic, diverse seizure patterns that have similar noise and filtering characteristics as human EEG. This generative model can aid in training seizure detection algorithms, understanding brain dynamical behavior for clinicians, and exploring the impact of noise on EEG recordings and detection algorithms.</p>

                <p>Most statistical inferences in neuroscience and psychology are based on frequentist statistics, which rely on sampling distributions: the long-run outcomes of multiple experiments, given a certain model. Yet, sampling distributions are poorly understood and rarely explicitly considered when making inferences. In this tutorial and commentary, I demonstrate how to use simulations to illustrate sampling distributions to answer simple practical questions: for instance, if we could run thousands of experiments, what would the outcome look like? What do these simulations tell us about the results from a single experiment? Such simulations can be run a priori, given expected results, or a posteriori, using existing datasets. Both approaches can help make explicit the data generating process and the sources of variability; they also reveal the large uncertainty in our experimental estimation and lead to the sobering realization that, in most situations, we should not make a big deal out of results from a single experiment. Simulations can also help demonstrate how the selection of effect sizes conditional on some arbitrary cutoff (<I>p</I> &le; 0.05) leads to a literature filled with false positives, a powerful illustration of the damage done in part by researchers&rsquo; over-confidence in their statistical tools. The tutorial focuses on graphical descriptions and covers examples using correlation analyses, proportion data, and response latency data.

                <p>by Ernesto Tavares-Neto, Marcel Aguilella-Arzo, Vicente M. Aguilella</p>

Electrostatic interactions are crucial for protein structure and function, especially in mesoscopic protein channels where ion selectivity is largely governed by the protein’s electrostatic properties. Understanding the protonation state of ionizable residues across pH values —often described by their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>— is key to linking structure and function. However, experimental p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> determination is challenging, typically carried out using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance only in a limited number of membrane proteins. Thus, computational methods are the primary alternative. Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) simulation is one of the most accurate p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods in proteins that contain many charged residues since it captures the coupling between conformational dynamics and residue protonation. Here we study the charge state of a general diffusion porin, OmpF, in which protons exert a crucial regulation of the channel discrimination of small inorganic ions as well as antibiotic translocation. We compare different p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods, using CpHMD as a benchmark, and discuss the somewhat unusual titration of several acidic residues. The most widely used p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods, though effective for globular proteins, fall short for membrane-embedded channels either because they were trained using pKa measurements in globular proteins or because of a poor description of the lipidic environment.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013612">Simultaneously determining regional heterogeneity and connection directionality from neural activity and symmetric connection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiawen Chang, Zhuda Yang, Changsong Zhou</p>

The spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are jointly shaped by directed structural interactions and heterogeneous intrinsic features of the neural components. Despite well-developed methods for estimating directionality in network connections from network of homogeneous nodes, how local heterogeneity impacts on directionality estimation remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in shaping network directionality and how these interactions should be incorporated into reconstruction frameworks remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel reconstruction framework that simultaneously estimates effective heterogeneity across network nodes and asymmetric network connections from neural activity and symmetric connection, both are assessible in experimental data, validated using macaque cortical connectivity data and several circuit models. We found that the estimated local heterogeneity remains consistent across various forms of parameterized local circuit heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated and quantified how hidden local inhibitory populations only modify within-region connection strengths, elucidating the functional equivalence between dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory networks and purely observing excitatory networks when estimating effective heterogeneity and asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrated the sampling interval effect in estimating network interactions with respect to the sampling resolution. Together, our results not only provide a unified framework for evaluating relative functional contributions of local heterogeneity and asymmetry to overall system dynamics but also reveal the fundamental limitations and scaling principles in reconstructing neural circuit connectivity from experimental observations.

                <p>by Krutika Patidar, Ashlee N. Ford Versypt</p>

The progression of diabetic kidney disease is often characterized by early dysfunction of glomerular endothelial cells, including alterations in fenestration size and number linked to impaired glomerular filtration. However, the cellular mechanisms regulating fenestrations in glomerular endothelial cells remain poorly understood due to limitations in existing <i>in vitro</i> models, challenges in imaging small fenestrations <i>in vivo</i>, and inconsistencies between <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> findings. This study used a logic-based protein-protein interaction network model with normalized Hill functions for dynamics to explore how glucose-mediated signaling dysregulation impacts fenestration dynamics in glomerular endothelial cells. Key drivers of fenestration loss and size changes were identified by incorporating signaling pathways related to actin remodeling, myosin light chain kinase, Rho-associated kinase, calcium, and VEGF and its receptors. The model predicted how hyperglycemia in diabetic mice leads to significant fenestration loss and increased size of fenestrations. Glycemic control in the pre-diabetic stage mitigated signaling dysregulation but was less effective as diabetic kidney disease developed and progressed. The model suggested alternative disease intervention strategies to maintain the integrity of the fenestration structure, such as targeting Rho-associated kinase, VEGF-A, NFκB, and actin stress fibers.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003459">Human brain integrates both unconditional and conditional timing statistics to guide expectation and behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yiyuan Teresa Huang, Zenas C. Chao</p>

Our brain uses prior experience to anticipate the timing of upcoming events. This dynamic process can be modeled using a hazard function derived from the probability distribution of event timings. However, the contexts of an event can lead to various probability distributions for the same event, and it remains unclear how the brain integrates these distributions into a coherent temporal prediction. In this study, we create a foreperiod sequence paradigm consisting of a sequence of paired trials, where in each trial, participants respond to a target signal after a specified time interval (i.e., foreperiod) following a warning cue. The prediction of the target onset in the second trial can be based on two probability distributions: the unconditional probability of the second foreperiod and its conditional probability given the foreperiod in the first trial. These probability distributions are then transformed into hazard functions to represent the unconditional and conditional temporal predictions. The behavioral model incorporating both predictions and their mutual modulation provides the best fit for reaction times to the target signal, indicating that both temporal statistics are integrated to make predictions. We further show that electroencephalographic source signals are also best reconstructed when integrating both predictions. Specifically, the unconditional and conditional predictions are encoded separately in the posterior and anterior brain regions, and integration of these two types of predictive processing requires a third region, particularly the right posterior cingulate area. Our study reveals brain networks that integrate multilevel temporal information, offering insight into the hierarchical predictive coding of time.

Neurons can adjust synaptic output according to the postsynaptic partners. However, the target-specific regulation of synaptic structures within individual neurons in the central nervous system remains unresolved. Applying the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated split-GFP tagging, we visualized the endogenous active zone scaffold protein, Bruchpilot (Brp), in specific cells. This technology enabled the spatial characterization of the presynaptic scaffolds only within the Kenyon cells (KCs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom bodies. We found the patterned accumulation of Brp among the compartments of axon terminals, where a KC synapses onto different postsynaptic neurons. Mechanistically, the localized octopaminergic projections along γ KC terminals regulate this compartmental Brp heterogeneity via Octβ2R and cAMP signaling. We further found that physiological stress, such as food or sleep deprivation reorganizes this intracellular pattern in an octopamine-dependent manner. Such concurrent regulation of local active zone assemblies thus suggests how the mushroom bodies integrate changing physiological states.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003042">New retron systems from environmental bacteria identify triggers of anti-phage defense and expand tools for genome editing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kazuo L. Nakamura, Karen Zhang, Mario R. Mestre, Matías Rojas-Montero, Seth L. Shipman</p>

Retrons are bacterial immune systems that protect a bacterial population against phages by killing infected hosts. Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase (RT), a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase (RT), noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we identify seven new retron systems, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize DNA production by these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of <i>Escherichia coli</i> phages. We find that two of these retrons are disrupted by other elements, in one case a group II intron and in another a separate defense system, yet both retrons still produce RT-DNA. For two other retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we engineer these retrons for genome editing in <i>E. coli</i>, demonstrating their potential use in a biotechnological application.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-675/v3?src=rss">Evaluating the Types of Performance Monitoring Used in Private Chartered Universities in Uganda: A Mixed-Methods [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Performance monitoring is essential for enhancing academic staff productivity and institutional accountability in higher education. In Uganda, private chartered universities face challenges in implementing effective performance monitoring systems. This study examines the types and effectiveness of these systems in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 386 academic staff using structured questionnaires, while qualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 10 academic deans from four selected universities. Ethical approval was obtained from institutional review boards and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS3145ES). Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to analyze quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative responses. Results Findings indicate that various performance monitoring tools are in use, including student evaluations, peer reviews, and supervisory assessments. However, their application is often inconsistent, with limited feedback loops and weak integration into staff development initiatives. Quantitative analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between effective performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that performance monitoring accounted for 21.3% of the variance in staff performance. Conclusions While performance monitoring tools are present in private chartered universities in Western Uganda, their inconsistent implementation undermines their effectiveness. Strengthening the integration of monitoring outcomes into professional development and decision-making processes could enhance academic staff performance. These findings underscore the need for systematic policy enforcement and capacity-building in performance management practices within the sector.
