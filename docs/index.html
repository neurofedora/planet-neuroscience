<p>Publication date: December 2018</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53</p><p>Author(s): Alessandro Simi, Mich√®le Studer</p><div><p>The subdivision of the mammalian neocortex into specialized modality-specific areas is responsible for the processing of sensory information followed by an adequate motor response. This process, called arealization, depends on the graded expression of transcription factors in neocortical progenitors and postmitotic neurons prenatally, and on external activity-dependent cues driven by thalamocortical axons during postnatal stages. Thalamic inputs are guided within an intrinsically determined genetic framework to selectively target and innervate layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons in a somatotopic manner. L4 spiny stellate neurons are excitatory locally projecting neurons, which undergo a drastic dendrite remodeling during the first postnatal week and represent the principal sensory gateway to the neocortex. In this review, we will discuss the way intrinsic cortical gene regulation and extrinsic activity-dependent inputs instruct the cellular reorganization of L4 spiny stellate neurons, necessary for proper formation of the barrel cortex during the development of primary somatosensory maps.</p></div>

<p>Patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) typically have normal
conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hence diagnosis based on MRI is
challenging. Anatomical abnormalities underlying brain dysfunctions in IGE are
unclear and their relation to the pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis is poorly
understood. In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative
neuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter
tissues in vivo. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we
incorporated our in vivo findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics
to suggest a plausible mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have
significant bilateral alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In cingulum,
fornix, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised,
whereas in specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus,
tract integrity is enhanced in patients. Incorporating these alterations in a
classification framework, we found that patients and controls are linearly
separable with 81.3% accuracy and 83.3% sensitivity. The computational model,
informed with the findings on the tract abnormalities, specifically highlighted
the importance of enhanced cortico-reticular connections along with impaired
cortico-cortical connections in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We
emphasise taking directionality of brain connectivity into consideration
towards understanding the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by
combining neuroimaging and computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of
structural alterations in IGEs may be applied as non-invasive diagnostic
biomarker. We suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical regions to the
thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for selectively
modifying the brain circuit to reverse the mechanisms leading to
epileptogenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34890">Embryonic hematopoiesis modulates the inflammatory response and larval hematopoiesis in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Recent lineage tracing analyses have significantly improved our understanding of immune system development and highlighted the importance of the different hematopoietic waves. The current challenge is to understand whether these waves interact and whether this affects the function of the immune system. Here we report a molecular pathway regulating the immune response and involving the communication between embryonic and larval hematopoietic waves in <i>Drosophila</i>. Down-regulating the transcription factor Gcm specific to embryonic hematopoiesis enhances the larval phenotypes induced by over-expressing the pro-inflammatory Jak/Stat pathway or by wasp infestation. Gcm works by modulating the transduction of the Upd cytokines to the site of larval hematopoiesis and hence the response to chronic (Jak/Stat over-expression) and acute (wasp infestation) immune challenges. Thus, homeostatic interactions control the function of the immune system in physiology and pathology. Our data also indicate that a transiently expressed developmental pathway has a long-lasting effect on the immune response.

Many species rely on olfaction to navigate towards food sources or mates. Olfactory navigation is a challenging task since odor environments are typically turbulent. While time-averaged odor concentration varies smoothly with the distance to the source, instaneous concentrations are intermittent and obtaining stable averages takes longer than the typical intervals between animals‚Äô navigation decisions. How to effectively sample from the odor distribution to determine sampling location is the focus on this article. To investigate which sampling strategies are most informative about the location of an odor source, we recorded three naturalistic stimuli with planar lased-induced fluorescence and used an information-theoretic approach to quantify the information that different sampling strategies provide about sampling location. Specifically, we compared multiple sampling strategies based on a fixed number of coding bits for encoding the olfactory stimulus. When the coding bits were all allocated to representing odor concentration at a single sensor, information rapidly saturated. Using the same number of coding bits in two sensors provides more information, as does coding multiple samples at different times. When accumulating multiple samples at a fixed location, the temporal sequence does not yield a large amount of information and can be averaged with minimal loss. Furthermore, we show that histogram-equalization is not the most efficient way to use coding bits when using the olfactory sample to determine location.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIMMO9rrGJQ" width="1" />

<p>by Spase Petkoski, J. Matias Palva, Viktor K. Jirsa</p>

Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance <i>œÄ</i> is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method‚Äôs impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and <i>œÄ</i>.

Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB) is an incurable, devastating, and mostly fatal inherited skin disease for which there is only supportive care. H-JEB is caused by loss-of-function mutations in LAMA3, LAMB3, or LAMC2, leading to complete loss of laminin 332, the major component of anchoring filaments, which mediate epidermal-dermal adherence....<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/9at3P0uWt3s" width="1" />

<p>Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or <i>Celf6</i>  <sup>+/-</sup> mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. <i>Celf6</i> mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Synchronization of finite spike sequences is the way two brain regions
compare their content and extract the most suitable sequence. This is the core
of the linguistic comparison between a word and a previous one retrieved by
memory. Classifying the information content of neural spike trains, an
uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration.
This uncertainty affects the task of synchronizing spike trains of different
duration representing different words, entailing the occurrence of entangled
sequences, so that word comparison amounts to a measurement based quantum
computation. Entanglement explains the inverse Bayes inference that connects
different words in a linguistic search. The behaviour here discussed provides
an explanation for other reported evidences of quantum effects in human
cognitive processes lacking a plausible framework, since either no assignment
of an appropriate quantum constant had been associated, or speculating on
microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic
de-coherence times.

<p>Fiber photometry permits monitoring fluorescent indicators of neural activity
in behaving animals. Optical fibers are typically used to excite and collect
fluorescence from genetically-encoded calcium indicators expressed by a subset
of neurons in a circuit of interest. However, a quantitative understanding of
the brain volumes from which signal is collected and how this depends on the
properties of the optical fibers are lacking. Here we analytically model and
experimentally measure the light emission and collection fields for optical
fibers in solution and scattering tissue, providing a comprehensive
characterization of fibers commonly employed for fiber photometry. Since
photometry signals depend on both excitation and collection efficiency, a
combined confocal/2-photon microscope was developed to evaluate these
parameters independently. We find that the 80% of the effective signal arises
from a 10^5-10^6 um3 volume extending ~200 um from the fiber face, and thus
permitting a spatial interpretation of measurements made with fiber photometry.

<p>The permutation test is known as the exact test procedure in statistics.
However, often it is not exact in practice and only an approximate method since
only a small fraction of every possible permutation is generated. Even for a
small sample size, it often requires to generate tens of thousands
permutations, which can be a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper,
we propose a novel combinatorial inference procedure that enumerates all
possible permutations combinatorially without any resampling. The proposed
method is validated against the standard permutation test in simulation studies
with the ground truth. The method is further applied in twin DTI study in
determining the genetic contribution of the minimum spanning tree of the
structural brain connectivity.

<p>Background: The n-back and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) are
commonly used verbal working memory tasks that have partially overlapping uses
in clinical and experimental psychology. We performed three activation
likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the
n-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses
aimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for
these tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the
frontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation
in the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and
left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher
activation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the
2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right
premotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).
These data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with
the phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.
Furthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional
processing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the
well-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,
premotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we
identify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically
reviewed prior to this study. Using ALE meta-analysis, we have also identified
meaningful differences in activation associated with specific cognitive and
emotional aspects of verbal working memory during these tasks.

<p>A convex code is a binary code generated by the pattern of intersections of a
collection of open convex sets in some Euclidean space. Convex codes are
relevant to neuroscience as they arise from the activity of neurons that have
convex receptive fields. In this paper, we use algebraic methods to determine
if a code is convex. Specifically, we use the neural ideal of a code, which is
a generalization of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Using the neural ideal together
with its standard generating set, the canonical form, we provide algebraic
signatures of certain families of codes that are non-convex. We connect these
signatures to the precise conditions on the arrangement of sets that prevent
the codes from being convex. Finally, we also provide algebraic signatures for
some families of codes that are convex, including the class of
intersection-complete codes. These results allow us to detect convexity and
non-convexity in a variety of situations, and point to some interesting open
questions.

<p>Multi-subject fMRI data analysis is an interesting and challenging problem in
human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

<p>We study stochastic Amari-type neural field equations, which are mean-field
models for neural activity in the cortex. We prove that under certain
assumptions on the coupling kernel, the neural field model can be viewed as a
gradient flow in a nonlocal Hilbert space. This makes all gradient-flow methods
available for the analysis, which could previously not be used, as it was not
known, whether a rigorous gradient flow formulation exists. We show that the
equation is well-posed in the nonlocal Hilbert space in the sense that
solutions starting in this space also remain in it for all times and space-time
regularity results hold for the case of spatially correlated noise. Uniqueness
of invariant measures and ergodic properties for the associated Feller
semigroups are also discussed.

<p>Understanding the role of astrocytes in brain computation is a nascent
challenge, promising immense rewards, in terms of new neurobiological knowledge
that can be translated into artificial intelligence. In our ongoing effort to
identify principles endow-ing the astrocyte with unique functions in brain
computation, and translate them into neural-astrocytic networks (NANs), we
propose a biophysically realistic model of an astrocyte that preserves the
experimentally observed spatial allocation of its distinct subcellular
compartments. We show how our model may encode, and modu-late, the extent of
synchronous neural activity via calcium waves that propagate intracellularly
across the astrocytic compartments. This relationship between neural activity
and astrocytic calcium waves has long been speculated but it is still lacking a
mechanistic explanation. Our model suggests an astrocytic "calcium cascade"
mechanism for neuronal synchronization, which may empower NANs by imposing
periodic neural modulation known to reduce coding errors. By expanding our
notions of information processing in astrocytes, our work aims to solidify a
computational role for non-neuronal cells and incorporate them into artificial
networks.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38268">Characterization of developmental and molecular factors underlying release heterogeneity at <i>Drosophila</i> synapses</a></h4>

Neurons communicate through neurotransmitter release at specialized synaptic regions known as active zones (AZs). Using biosensors to visualize single synaptic vesicle fusion events at <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junctions, we analyzed the developmental and molecular determinants of release probability (<i>P<sub>r</sub></i>) for a defined connection with ~300 AZs. <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> was heterogeneous but represented a stable feature of each AZ. <i>P<sub>r</sub></i>remained stable during high frequency stimulation and retained heterogeneity in mutants lacking the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin 1. <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> correlated with both presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at individual release sites. <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> heterogeneity also correlated with glutamate receptor abundance, with high <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> connections developing receptor subtype segregation. Intravital imaging throughout development revealed that AZs acquire high <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> during a multi-day maturation period, with <i>P<sub>r</sub></i> heterogeneity largely reflecting AZ age. The rate of synapse maturation was activity-dependent, as both increases and decreases in neuronal activity modulated glutamate receptor field size and segregation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37624">Biophysical clocks face a trade-off between internal and external noise resistance</a></h4>

Many organisms use free running circadian clocks to anticipate the day night cycle. However, others organisms use simple stimulus-response strategies ('hourglass clocks') and it is not clear when such strategies are sufficient or even preferable to free running clocks. Here, we find that free running clocks, such as those found in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> and humans, can efficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns ('external noise') by exploiting their limit cycle attractor. However, such limit cycles are necessarily vulnerable to 'internal noise'. Hence, at sufficiently high internal noise, point attractor-based 'hourglass' clocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy number, <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i>, outperform free running clocks. By interpolating between these two regimes in a diverse range of oscillators drawn from across biology, we demonstrate biochemical clock architectures that are best suited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.

The RAS family of proteins is amongst the most highly mutated in human cancers and has so far eluded drug therapy. Currently, much effort is being made to discover mutant RAS inhibitors and in vitro screening for RAS-binding drugs must be followed by cell-based assays. Here, we have developed a robust set of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based RAS biosensors that enable monitoring of RAS-effector interaction inhibition in living cells. These include KRAS, HRAS and NRAS and a variety of different mutations that mirror those found in human cancers with the major RAS effectors such as CRAF, PI3K and RALGDS. We highlighted the utility of these RAS biosensors by showing a RAS-binding compound is a potent pan-RAS-effector interactions inhibitor in cells. The RAS biosensors represent a useful tool to investigate and characterize the potency of anti-RAS inhibitors in cells and more generally any RAS protein-protein interaction (PPI) in cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36919">CYK-4 functions independently of its centralspindlin partner ZEN-4 to cellularize oocytes in germline syncytia</a></h4>

Throughout metazoans, germ cells undergo incomplete cytokinesis to form syncytia connected by intercellular bridges. Gamete formation ultimately requires bridge closure, yet how bridges are reactivated to close is not known. The most conserved bridge component is centralspindlin, a complex of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and the microtubule motor ZEN-4/kinesin-6. Here, we show that oocyte production by the syncytial <i>C. elegans</i> germline requires CYK-4 but not ZEN-4, which contrasts with cytokinesis, where both are essential. Longitudinal imaging after conditional inactivation revealed that CYK-4 activity is important for oocyte cellularization, but not for the cytokinesis-like events that generate syncytial compartments. CYK-4's lipid-binding C1 domain and the GTPase-binding interface of its GAP domain were both required to target CYK-4 to intercellular bridges and to cellularize oocytes. These results suggest that the conserved C1-GAP region of CYK-4 constitutes a targeting module required for closure of intercellular bridges in germline syncytia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36584">Inert and seed-competent tau monomers suggest structural origins of aggregation</a></h4>

Tauopathies feature progressive accumulation of tau amyloids. Pathology may begin when these amplify from a protein template, or seed, whose structure is unknown. We have purified and characterized distinct forms of tau monomer‚Äîinert (M<sub>i</sub>) and seed-competent (M<sub>s</sub>). Recombinant M<sub>s</sub> triggered intracellular tau aggregation, induced tau fibrillization in vitro, and self-assembled. M<sub>s</sub> from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease also seeded aggregation and self-assembled in vitro to form seed-competent multimers. We used crosslinking with mass spectrometry to probe structural differences in M<sub>i</sub> vs. M<sub>s</sub>. Crosslinks informed models of local peptide structure within the repeat domain which suggest relative inaccessibility of residues that drive aggregation (VQIINK/VQIVYK) in M<sub>i</sub>, and exposure in M<sub>s</sub>. Limited proteolysis supported this idea. Although tau monomer has been considered to be natively unstructured, our findings belie this assumption and suggest that initiation of pathological aggregation could begin with conversion of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36123">Down regulation of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to enable transition between motor states</a></h4>

The neural control of transition between posture and movement encompasses the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reactions forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35788">A promoter interaction map for cardiovascular disease genetics</a></h4>

Over 500 genetic loci have been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), however most loci are located in gene-distal non-coding regions and their target genes are not known. Here, we generated high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) maps in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to provide a resource for identifying and prioritizing the functional targets of CVD associations. We validate these maps by demonstrating that promoters preferentially contact distal sequences enriched for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs and are enriched for chromatin marks that correlate with dynamic changes in gene expression. Using the CM PCHi-C map, we linked 1,999 CVD-associated SNPs to 347 target genes. Remarkably, more than 90% of SNP-target gene interactions did not involve the nearest gene, while 40% of SNPs interacted with at least two genes, demonstrating the importance of considering long-range chromatin interactions when interpreting functional targets of disease loci.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35449">Stem cell heterogeneity drives the parasitic life cycle of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i></a></h4>

Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms infecting hundreds of millions of people. These parasites alternate between asexual reproduction in molluscan hosts and sexual reproduction in mammalian hosts; short-lived, water-borne stages infect each host. Thriving in such disparate environments requires remarkable developmental plasticity, manifested by five body plans deployed throughout the parasite‚Äôs life cycle. Stem cells in <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> provide a potential source for such plasticity; however, the relationship between stem cells from different life-cycle stages remains unclear, as does the origin of the germline, required for sexual reproduction. Here, we show that subsets of larvally derived stem cells are likely sources of adult stem cells and the germline. We also identify a novel gene that serves as the earliest marker for the schistosome germline, which emerges inside the mammalian host and is ultimately responsible for disease pathology. This work reveals the stem cell heterogeneity driving the propagation of the schistosome life cycle.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34961">Variations in HLA-B cell surface expression, half-life and extracellular antigen receptivity</a></h4>

The highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules present peptide antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, inducing immunity against infections and cancers. Quality control mediated by peptide loading complex (PLC) components is expected to ensure the cell surface expression of stable peptide-HLA class I complexes. This is exemplified by HLA-B*08:01 in primary human lymphocytes, with both expression level and half-life at the high end of the measured HLA-B expression and stability hierarchies. Conversely, low expression on lymphocytes is measured for three HLA-B allotypes that bind peptides with proline at position 2, which are disfavored by the transporter associated with antigen processing. Surprisingly, these lymphocyte-specific expression and stability differences become reversed or altered in monocytes, which display larger intracellular pools of HLA class I than lymphocytes. Together, the findings indicate that allele and cell-dependent variations in antigen acquisition pathways influence HLA-B surface expression levels, half-lives and receptivity to exogenous antigens.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent metabolic deregulation is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) encoding genes (<i>PSEN1</i> and <i>PSEN2</i>) cause most cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that mutations in the <i>C. elegans</i> gene encoding a PSEN homolog, <i>sel-12</i> result in mitochondrial metabolic defects that promote neurodegeneration as a result of oxidative stress. In <i>sel-12</i> mutants, elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling leads to an increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> content which stimulates mitochondrial respiration resulting in an increase in mitochondrial superoxide production. By reducing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake or mitochondrial superoxides in <i>sel-12</i> mutants, we demonstrate rescue of the mitochondrial metabolic defects and prevent neurodegeneration. These data suggest that mutations in PSEN alter mitochondrial metabolic function via ER to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and provide insight for alternative targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/32055">Adaptive coding for dynamic sensory inference</a></h4>

Behavior relies on the ability of sensory systems to infer properties of the environment from incoming stimuli. The accuracy of inference depends on the fidelity with which behaviorally relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we discuss general principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution. We predict dynamical signatures of such encoding schemes and demonstrate how known phenomena, such as burst coding and firing rate adaptation, can be understood as hallmarks of optimal coding for accurate inference.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations and excitability levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). These effects can last for more than an hour and an involvement of <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-methyl-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic plasticity has been suggested. However, to date the cortical mechanisms underlying tACS after-effects have not been explored. Here, we applied 20 Hz beta tACS to M1 while participants received either the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan or a placebo and the effects on cortical beta oscillations and excitability were explored. When a placebo medication was administered, beta tACS was found to increase cortical excitability and beta oscillations for at least 60 min, whereas when dextromethorphan was administered, these effects were completely abolished. These results provide the first direct evidence that tACS can induce NMDAR-mediated plasticity in the motor cortex, which contributes to our understanding of tACS-induced influences on human motor cortex physiology.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Microglial cells are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain development. We previously showed that microglia colonize the cortical proliferative zones in the prenatal brain and regulate the number of precursor cells through phagocytosis.

Tissues were collected and counterstained with cell-specific markers to label microglial cells and identify other cortical cell types. We found that microglial cells intimately interact with the radial glial scaffold and make extensive contacts with neural precursor cells throughout the proliferative zones, particularly in the rhesus monkey fetus when compared to rodents. We also identify a subtype of microglia, which we term ‚Äòperiventricular microglia‚Äô, that interact closely with mitotic precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Our data suggest that microglia are structural modulators that facilitate remodeling of the proliferative zones as precursor cells migrate away from the ventricle and may facilitate the delamination of precursor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial cells are an integral component of cortical proliferative zones and contribute to the interactive milieu in which cortical precursor cells function.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/367011v1?rss=1">Stable memory and computation in randomly rewiring neural networks</a></h4>

Our brains must maintain a representation of the world over a period of time much longer than the typical lifetime of the biological components producing that representation. For example, recent research suggests that dendritic spines in the adult mouse hippocampus are transient with an average lifetime of approximately 10 days. If this is true, and if turnover is equally likely for all spines, approximately 95-percent of excitatory synapses onto a particular neuron will turn over within 30 days; however, a neuron's receptive field can be relatively stable over this period. Here, we use computational modeling to ask how memories can persist in neural circuits such as the hippocampus and visual cortex in the face of synapse turnover. We demonstrate that Hebbian learning during replay of pre-synaptic activity patterns can integrate newly formed synapses into pre-existing memories. Further, we find that Hebbian learning during replay is sufficient to stabilize the receptive fields of hippocampal place cells in a model of the grid-cell-to-place-cell transformation in CA1 and of orientation-selective cells in a model of the center-surround-to-simple-cell transformation in V1. We also ask how synapse turnover affects memory in Hopfield networks with CA3-like, auto-associative properties. We find that attractors of Hopfield networks are remarkably stable if learning occurs during network reactivations. Together, these data suggest that a simple learning rule, correlative Hebbian plasticity of synaptic strengths, is sufficient to preserve neural representations in the face of synapse turnover, even in the absence of Hebbian structural plasticity.

The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is involved in many cellular processes and it regulates synaptic and network development in neurons. Its absence is known to lead to intellectual disability, with a wide range of co-morbidities including autism. Over the past decades, FMRP research focused on abnormalities both in glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling, and an altered balance between excitation and inhibition has been hypothesised to underlie the clinical consequences of absence of the protein. Using FMRP knockout mice, we studied an in vitro model of cortical microcircuitry and observed that the loss of FMRP largely affected the electrophysiological correlates of network development and maturation but caused less alterations in single-cell phenotypes. Using a mathematical model, we demonstrated that the combination of an increased excitation and reduced inhibition describes best predicts our experimental observations during the ex vivo formation of the network connections.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly associated with de novo gene mutations. One of the most commonly affected genes is SCN2A. ASD-associated SCN2A mutations impair the encoded protein NaV1.2, a sodium channel important for action potential initiation and propagation in developing excitatory cortical neurons. The link between an axonal sodium channel and ASD, a disorder typically attributed to synaptic or transcriptional dysfunction, is unclear. Here, we show NaV1.2 is unexpectedly critical for dendritic excitability and synaptic function in mature pyramidal neurons, in addition to regulating early developmental axonal excitability. NaV1.2 loss reduced action potential backpropagation into dendrites, impairing synaptic plasticity and synaptic stability, even when NaV1.2 expression was disrupted late in development. Furthermore, we identified behavioral impairments in learning and sociability, paralleling observations in children with SCN2A loss. These results reveal a novel dendritic function for NaV1.2, providing insight into cellular mechanisms likely underlying circuit and behavioral dysfunction in ASD.

Males and females often produce distinct responses to the same sensory stimuli. How such differences arise - at the level of sensory processing or in the circuits that generate behavior - remains largely unresolved across sensory modalities. We address this issue in the acoustic communication system of Drosophila. During courtship, males generate time-varying songs, and each sex responds with specific behaviors. We characterize male and female behavioral tuning for all aspects of song, and show that feature tuning is similar between sexes, suggesting sex-shared song detectors drive divergent behaviors. We then identify higher-order neurons in the Drosophila brain, called pC2, that are tuned for multiple temporal aspects of one mode of the male's song, drive sex-specific behaviors, and show a mirrored correspondence between sensory and motor tuning. We thus uncover acoustic object detector neurons at the sensory-motor interface that flexibly link auditory perception with sex-specific behavioral responses to communication signals.

Humans can learn abstract concepts that describe invariances over relational patterns in data. One such concept, known as magnitude, allows stimuli to be compactly represented by a single dimension (i.e. on a mental line), for example according to their cardinality, size or value. Here, we measured representations of magnitude in humans by recording neural signals whilst they viewed symbolic numbers. During a subsequent reward-guided learning task, the neural patterns elicited by novel complex visual images reflected their pay-out probability in a way that suggested they were encoded onto the same mental number line. Our findings suggest that in humans, learning about values is accompanied by structural alignment of value representations with neural codes for the concept of magnitude.

How people process images is known to affect memory for those images, but these effects have typically been studied using explicit task instructions to vary encoding. Here, we investigate the effects of intrinsic variation in processing on subsequent memory, testing whether recognizing an ambiguous stimulus as meaningful (as a face vs. as shape blobs) predicts subsequent visual memory even when matching the perceptual features and the encoding strategy between subsequently remembered and subsequently forgotten items. We show that single trial EEG activity can predict whether participants will subsequently remember an ambiguous Mooney face image (e.g., an image that will sometimes be seen as a face and sometimes not be seen as a face). In addition, we show that a classifier trained only to discriminate between whether participants perceive a face vs. non-face can generalize to predict whether an ambiguous image is subsequently remembered. Furthermore, when we examine the N170, an ERP index of face processing, we find that images that elicit larger N170s are more likely to be remembered than those that elicit smaller N170s, even when the exact same image elicited larger or smaller N170s across participants. Thus, images processed as meaningful - in this case as a face - during encoding are better remembered than identical images that are not processed as a face. This provides strong evidence that understanding the meaning of a stimulus during encoding plays a critical role in visual memory.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366427v1?rss=1">Do we predict upcoming speech content in naturalistic environments?</a></h4>

The ability to predict upcoming actions is a characteristic hallmark of cognition and therefore not surprisingly a central topic in cognitive science. It remains unclear, however, whether the predictive behaviour commonly observed in strictly controlled lab environments generalizes to rich, everyday settings. In four virtual reality experiments, we tested whether a well-established marker of linguistic prediction (i.e. anticipatory eye movements as observed in the visual world paradigm) replicated when increasing the naturalness of the paradigm by means of i) immersing participants in naturalistic everyday scenes, ii) increasing the number of distractor objects present, iii) manipulating the location of referents in central versus peripheral vision, and iv) modifying the proportion of predictable nounreferents in the experiment. Robust anticipatory eye movements were observed, even in the presence of 10 objects (hereby testing working memory) and when only 25% of all sentences contained a visually present referent (hereby testing error-based learning). The anticipatory effect disappeared, however, when referents were placed in peripheral vision. Together, our findings suggest that working memory may play an important role in predictive processing in everyday communication, but only in contexts where upcoming referents have been explicitly attended to prior to encountering the spoken referential act. Methodologically, our study confirms that ecological validity and experimental control may go hand in hand in future studies of human predictive behaviour.

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in mammalian hypothalamus play important roles in regulating appetite, energy expenditure, and glucose and fat metabolisms. Diet-induced obesity often show sex-specific difference. But the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that microRNA (miRNA) miR-7 and miR-17-92 are expressed in the mouse ARC, and mostly in POMC neurons. Knockdown of miR-7 and knockout of miR-17-92 specifically in POMC neurons aggravate diet-induced obesity only in females and males, respectively. Moreover, gene expression profile analysis identifies sex-differential genes in male and female ARCs in wildtype adult mice. Interestingly, these genes that normally show low-expression in the female and male ARCs display upregulated expression in female miR-7 knockdown and male miR-17-92 knockout mice, respectively. Our results demonstrate an important role of miRNAs in regulating sex-specific diet-induced obesity, likely through modulating expression of target genes that show sex-differential expression in the ARC of hypothalamus.

Dopamine deficiency caused by apoptosis of the dopaminergic nerve cells in the midbrain substantia nigra is the main pathological basis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent research has shown that dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated aberrant mitochondrial fission plays an important role in dopaminergic nerve cell apoptosis. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Our study shows that knockdown of Drp1 blocked aberrant mitochondrial fission and dopaminergic nerve cell apoptosis. Importantly, we found that ROCK1 was activated in an MPP+-induced PD cell model and that ROCK1 knockdown and the specific ROCK1 activation inhibitor Y-27632 blocked Drp1-mediated aberrant mitochondrial fission and apoptosis of dopaminergic nerve cell through suppression of Drp1 dephosphorylation/activation. Our in vivo study confirmed that Y-27632 significantly improved symptoms of a PD mouse model through inhibition of Drp1-mediated aberrant mitochondrial fission and apoptosis of dopaminergic nerve cell. Collectively, Our study suggests an important molecular mechanism of PD pathogenesis involving ROCK1-regulated dopaminergic nerve cell apoptosis via activation of Drp1-induced aberrant mitochondrial fission.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366393v1?rss=1">Reference Repulsion Is Not a Perceptual Illusion</a></h4>

Perceptual decisions are often influenced by contextual factors. For instance, when engaged in a visual discrimination task against a reference boundary, subjective reports about the judged stimulus feature are biased away from the boundary - a phenomenon termed reference repulsion. Until recently, this phenomenon has been thought to reflect a perceptual illusion regarding the appearance of the stimulus, but new evidence suggests that it may rather reflect a post-perceptual decision bias. To shed light on this issue, we examined whether and how orientation judgments affect perceptual appearance. In a first experiment, we confirmed that after judging a grating stimulus against a discrimination boundary, the subsequent reproduction response was indeed repelled from the boundary. To investigate the perceptual nature of this bias, in a second experiment we measured the perceived orientation of the grating stimulus more directly, in comparison to a reference stimulus visible at the same time. Although we did observe a small repulsive bias away from the boundary, this bias was explained by random trial-by-trial fluctuations in sensory representations and not a systematic bias due to the discrimination judgment. Overall, the current study indicates that discrimination judgments do not elicit a perceptual illusion and points towards a post-perceptual locus of reference repulsion.

The small Rho-family GTPase CDC42 has long been known to have a role in cell motility and axon growth. The eukaryotic Cdc42 gene is alternatively spliced yielding mRNAs with two different 3'UTRs and distinct C-termini, which have CaaX and CCaX motifs for post-translational prenylation or palmitoylation, respectively. Palmitoylated CDC42 protein has been shown to contribute to dendrite maturation, while the prenylated CDC42 protein contributes to axon specification. Here, we show that the mRNA encoding prenylated CDC42 protein preferentially localizes into axons of cultured sensory neurons. We show that prenylated CDC42 promotes axon growth in cultured sensory neurons, but palmitoylated CDC42 does not affect axon growth. The growth promotion by prenylated CDC42 requires axonal localization of its mRNA and an intact C-terminal CaaX motif for post-translational modification of the encoded protein by prenylation. Prenylated CDC42 protein localizes to the periphery of growth cones, but this subcellular localization requires axonal targeting of its mRNA. Together, these data show that alternative splicing of the Cdc42 gene product generates an axon growth-promoting, locally synthesized prenylated CDC42 protein.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/365593v1?rss=1">What is a cognitive map? Organising knowledge for flexible behaviour</a></h4>

It is proposed that a cognitive map encoding the relationships between entities in the world supports flexible behaviour, but the majority of the neural evidence for such a system comes from studies of spatial navigation. Recent work describing neuronal parallels between spatial and non-spatial behaviours has rekindled the notion of a systematic organisation of knowledge across multiple domains. We review experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks that point to principles unifying these apparently disparate functions. These principles describe how to learn and use abstract, generalisable knowledge and suggest map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organising knowledge of all kinds. We highlight how artificial agents endowed with such principles exhibit flexible behaviour and learn map-like representations observed in the brain. Finally, we speculate on how these principles may offer insight into the extreme generalisations, abstractions and inferences that characterise human cognition.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 2% of the population over the age of 60. To date, there is no disease modifying drugs to prevent dopaminergic neuron loss and abnormal protein deposition in the brains. There is a strong demand for neuroprotective therapies to prevent or slow down dopaminergic neuron degeneration. An essential prerequisite for a compound designed to affect the central nervous system (CNS) is a satisfactory transport through the blood brain barrier (BBB). Numerous posts on the net suggest that both repositioned drugs molecules and active molecules present in dietary supplements may slow down PD's progression. The logBB is an index of BBB permeability. Starting from quantitative and qualitative permeability data, this study tries to predict logBB values from various physicochemical properties of molecules, including, among others, molecular size, polar surface area (PSA) and logP values. Quantitative logBB models were implemented using MLP (multiple linear regression), PLS (Partial Least Square), AAKR (Auto Associative Kernel Regression) and ECM (Evolving Cluster Method). Qualitative models were carried out with SVM (Support Vector Method). The paper compares performances of qualitative and quantitative methods and applies them to estimate BBB permeability of 39 molecules potentially able to slow down PD's progression. For more information, the current study also gives a short overview of the state of the art on the potential impact of dietary supplements on PD.

<p>by Yina Wei, Giri P. Krishnan, Maxim Komarov, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation of recent memories. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of consolidation during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized around the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jzS-ldh1Muw" width="1" />

<p>by Bet√ºl Senay Aras, Y. C. Zhou, Adriana Dawes, Ching-Shan Chou</p>

Intracellular polarization, where a cell specifies a spatial axis by segregation of specific factors, is a fundamental biological process. In the early embryo of the nematode worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)</i>, polarization is often accompanied by deformations of the cortex, a highly contractile structure consisting of actin filaments cross-linked by the motor protein myosin (actomyosin). It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0GKlDO6sm0" width="1" />

<p>by Joshua H. Goldwyn, Bradley R. Slabe, Joseph B. Travers, David Terman</p>

Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a <i>subtractive</i> or <i>divisive</i> effect on a neuron‚Äôs output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two ‚Äúmodes‚Äù of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>A</sub>). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and <i>I</i><sub>A</sub>. Our findings suggest that neurons can ‚Äúself-regulate‚Äù the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for <i>I</i><sub>A</sub> would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDIMHtgjtOc" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here we test Humans, Rats, Monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, Tree Shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, Rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: While Monkeys and Tree Shrews based their choices largely on visual information, Rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, Rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision-making.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Research into the biology of cognition and behavior increasingly relies on studies performed in murine species (mice and rats). This is due to the explosion of powerful new, murine specific, genetic tools allowing for unprecedented control in imaging and manipulation of neural circuit elements. Lacking, are concomitant comparative behavioral studies necessary toward translating these exciting results to other species, particularly humans. We show here that, unlike primates, muridae incorporate species-specific predispositions and bias into their behavioral strategy toward the solution of a simple visual task, and are therefore engaging specific circuits not used by primates during task performance. This contradicts the long held idea that learning abolishes species-specific predispositions, and highlights the importance of comparative behavioral studies in translational neuroscience.</p>

<p>The purpose of this work is to construct a model for the functional
architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1), based on a structure of metric
measure space induced by the underlying organization of receptive profiles
(RPs) of visual cells. In order to account for the horizontal connectivity of
V1 in such a context, a diffusion process compatible with the geometry of the
space is defined following the classical approach of K.-T. Sturm. The
construction of our distance function does neither require any group
parameterization of the family of RPs, nor involve any differential structure.
As such, it adapts to non-parameterized sets of RPs, possibly obtained through
numerical procedures; it also allows to model the lateral connectivity arising
from non-differential metrics such as the one induced on a pinwheel surface by
a family of filters of vanishing scale. On the other hand, when applied to the
classical framework of Gabor filters, this construction yields a distance
approximating the sub-Riemannian structure proposed as a model for V1 by G.
Citti and A. Sarti [J Math Imaging Vis 24: 307 (2006)], thus showing itself to
be consistent with existing cortex models.

<p>Neural codes are binary codes in $\{0,1\}^n$; here we focus on the ones which
represent the firing patterns of a type of neurons called place cells. There is
much interest in determining which neural codes can be realized by a collection
of convex sets. However, drawing representations of these convex sets,
particularly as the number of neurons in a code increases, can be very
difficult. Nevertheless, for a class of codes that are said to be
$k$-inductively pierced for $k=0,1,2$ there is an algorithm for drawing Euler
diagrams. Here we use the toric ideal of a code to show sufficient conditions
for a code to be 1- or 2-inductively pierced, so that we may use the existing
algorithm to draw realizations of such codes.

<p>It is true that the "best" neural network is not necessarily the one with the
most "brain-like" behavior. Understanding biological intelligence, however, is
a fundamental goal for several distinct disciplines. Translating our
understanding of intelligence to machines is a fundamental problem in robotics.
Propelled by new advancements in Neuroscience, we developed a spiking neural
network (SNN) that draws from mounting experimental evidence that a number of
individual neurons is associated with spatial navigation. By following the
brain's structure, our model assumes no initial all-to-all connectivity, which
could inhibit its translation to a neuromorphic hardware, and learns an
uncharted territory by mapping its identified components into a limited number
of neural representations, through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). In
our ongoing effort to employ a bioinspired SNN-controlled robot to real-world
spatial mapping applications, we demonstrate here how an SNN may robustly
control an autonomous robot in mapping and exploring an unknown environment,
while compensating for its own intrinsic hardware imperfections, such as
partial or total loss of visual input.

<p>The human brain is a complex dynamical system that gives rise to cognition
through spatiotemporal patterns of coherent and incoherent activity between
brain regions. As different regions dynamically interact to perform cognitive
tasks, variable patterns of partial synchrony can be observed, forming chimera
states. We propose that the emergence of such states plays a fundamental role
in the cognitive organization of the brain, and present a novel
cognitively-informed, chimera-based framework to explore how large-scale brain
architecture affects brain dynamics and function. Using personalized brain
network models, we systematically study how regional brain stimulation produces
different patterns of synchronization across predefined cognitive systems. We
then analyze these emergent patterns within our novel framework to understand
the impact of subject-specific and region-specific structural variability on
brain dynamics. Our results suggest a classification of cognitive systems into
four groups with differing levels of subject and regional variability that
reflect their different functional roles.

<p>The human brain is ultimately responsible for all thoughts and movements that
the body produces. This allows humans to successfully interact with their
environment. If the brain is not functioning properly many abilities of human
can be damaged. The goal of cerebral signal analysis is to learn about brain
function. The idea that distinct areas of the brain are responsible for
specific tasks, the functional segregation, is a key aspect of brain function.
Functional integration is an important feature of brain function, it is the
concordance of multiple segregated brain areas to produce a unified response.
There is an amplified feedback mechanism in the brain called reentry which
requires specific timing relations. This specific timing requires neurons
within an assembly to synchronize their firing rates. This has led to increased
interest and use of phase variables, particularly their synchronization, to
measure connectivity in cerebral signals. Herein, we propose a comprehensive
review on concepts and methods previously presented for assessing cerebral
synchrony, with focus on phase synchronization, as a tool for brain
connectivity evaluation.

The mammalian FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase complex (FRRUC) mono-ubiquitylates H2A at Lys119 to repress transcription in unstressed cells. We found that the FRRUC is rapidly and transiently recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PARP1- and TIMELESS-dependent manner to promote mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at Lys119, a local decrease of H2A levels, and an increase of H2A.Z incorporation. Both the FRRUC and H2A.Z promote transcriptional repression, double strand break signaling, and homologous recombination repair (HRR). All these events require both the presence and activity of the FRRUC. Moreover, the FRRUC and its activity are required for the proper recruitment of BMI1-RNF2 and MEL18-RNF2, two other ubiquitin ligases that mono-ubiquitylate Lys119 in H2A upon genotoxic stress. Notably, whereas H2A.Z is not required for H2A mono-ubiquitylation, impairment of the latter results in the inhibition of H2A.Z incorporation. We propose that the recruitment of the FRRUC represents an early and critical regulatory step in HRR.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36497">NSF-mediated disassembly of on and off-pathway SNARE complexes and inhibition by complexin</a></h4>

SNARE complex disassembly by the ATPase NSF is essential for neurotransmitter release and other membrane trafficking processes. We developed a single molecule FRET assay to monitor repeated rounds of NSF-mediated disassembly and reassembly of individual SNARE complexes. For ternary neuronal SNARE complexes, disassembly proceeds in a single step within 100 msec. We observed short- (&lt; 0.32 sec) and long-lived ({greater than or equal to} 0.32 sec) disassembled states. The long-lived states represent fully disassembled SNARE complex, while the short-lived states correspond to failed disassembly or immediate re-assembly. Either high ionic strength or decreased Œ±SNAP concentration reduces the disassembly rate while increasing the frequency of short-lived states. NSF is also capable of disassembling anti-parallel ternary SNARE complexes, suggesting a role in quality control. Finally, complexin-1 competes with Œ±SNAP binding to the SNARE complex; addition of complexin-1 has an effect similar to that of decreasing the Œ±SNAP concentration, suggesting a possible regulatory role in disassembly.

Exhaustion of stem cells is a hallmark of aging. In the <i>Drosophila</i> testis, dedifferentiated germline stem cells (GSCs) derived from spermatogonia increases during lifespan, leading to the model that dedifferentiation counteracts the decline of GSCs in aged males. To test this, we blocked dedifferentiation by mis-expressing the differentiation factor <i>bag of marbles</i> (<i>bam</i>) in spermatogonia while lineage-labeling these cells. Strikingly, blocking <i>bam</i>-lineage dedifferentiation under normal conditions in virgin males has no impact on the GSC pool. However, in mated males or challenging conditions, inhibiting <i>bam</i>-lineage dedifferentiation markedly reduced the number of GSCs and their ability to proliferate and differentiate. We find that <i>bam</i>-lineage derived GSCs have significantly higher proliferation rates than sibling GSCs in the same testis. We determined that Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity is autonomously required for <i>bam</i>-lineage dedifferentiation. Overall, we show that dedifferentiation provides a mechanism to maintain the germline and ensure fertility under chronically stressful conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35800">Removing physiological motion from intravital and clinical functional imaging data</a></h4>

Intravital microscopy can provide unique insights into the function of biological processes in a native context. However, physiological motion caused by peristalsis, respiration and the heartbeat can present a significant challenge, particularly for functional readouts such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), which require longer acquisition times to obtain a quantitative readout. Here, we present and benchmark <i>Galene</i>, a versatile multi-platform software tool for image-based correction of sample motion blurring in both time resolved and conventional laser scanning fluorescence microscopy data in two and three dimensions. We show that <i>Galene</i> is able to resolve intravital FLIM-FRET images of intra-abdominal organs in murine models and NADH autofluorescence of human dermal tissue imaging subject to a wide range of physiological motions. Thus, <i>Galene</i> can enable FLIM imaging in situations where a stable imaging platform is not always possible and rescue previously discarded quantitative imaging data.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35388">Engineering ER-stress dependent non-conventional mRNA splicing</a></h4>

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding capacity is balanced with the protein folding burden to prevent accumulation of un- or misfolded proteins. The ER membrane-resident kinase/RNase Ire1 maintains ER protein homeostasis through two fundamentally distinct processes. First, Ire1 can initiate a transcriptional response through a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction to increase the ER folding capacity. Second, Ire1 can decrease the ER folding burden through selective mRNA decay. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</i> the two Ire1 functions have been evolutionarily separated. Here, we show that the respective Ire1 orthologs have become specialized for their functional outputs by divergence of their RNase specificities. In addition, RNA structural features separate the splicing substrates from the decay substrates. Using these insights, we engineered an <i>S. pombe</i> Ire1 cleavage substrate into a splicing substrate, which confers <i>S. pombe</i> with both Ire1 functional outputs.

Axonal regeneration in the mature CNS is limited by inhibitory factors within the extracellular environment. In this study, we show that histones H3 and H4 inhibit neurite outgrowth when applied to cortical neurons in vitro, and that this effect can be reversed by the addition of activated protein C (APC). Elevated levels of histones H3 and H4 were also detected in cerebrospinal fluid following CNS injury, and treatment with APC significantly increased axonal regeneration. Mechanistically, we have determined that histones activate a retrograde signaling cascade that results in phosphorylation of the transcription factor YB-1, and that neurite outgrowth is impaired when YB-1 is overexpressed in cortical neurons. These findings identify extracellular histones as a new class of growth-inhibiting molecules within the injured CNS.

Functional brain networks including Default Mode, Salience, and Executive Control (DMN; SN; ECN), collectively called the 'triple-network', are associated with Depressive Rumination (DR) severity in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The underlying white-matter (WM) microstructure supporting these networks and its precise role in DR remains unknown, however. Using diffusion MRI and resting-state BOLD fMRI, we explored multimodal relationships between DR, WM microstructure, and triple-network functional connectivity in adults with MDD (N = 39), and then replicated our analyses in an independent dataset of adults with MDD (N = 39). Results showed that higher DR severity was negatively associated with: (a) microstructure of primary and secondary WM fibers spanning the right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus and surrounding clusters, (b) functional network connectivity of the Cingulo-Opercular SN (coSN), Precuneal DMN (pDMN), and frontal ECN (fECN), (c) inverse correlations between the pDMN and each of the coSN and fECN, and (d) a direct correlation between the fECN and coSN. Ultimately, thirty-one findings replicated fully or partially, lending support to the conclusion that individual differences in WM microstructure, resting-state functional connectivity of the triple-network, and their multivariate, microstructural-functional intersection, provide a neurobiological basis for depressive rumination.

Purpose To measure the pupil response to pulses of melanopsin-directed contrast, and compare this response to those evoked by cone-directed contrast and spectrally- narrowband stimuli. Methods 3-second unipolar pulses were used to elicit pupil responses in human subjects across 3 sessions. Thirty subjects were studied in Session 1, and most returned for Sessions 2 and 3. The stimuli of primary interest were 'silent substitution' cone- and melanopsin-directed modulations. Red and blue narrowband pulses delivered using the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) paradigm were also studied. Sessions 1 and 2 were identical, while Session 3 involved modulations around higher radiance backgrounds. The pupil responses were fit by a model whose parameters described response amplitude and temporal shape. Results Group average pupil responses for all stimuli overlapped extensively across Sessions 1 and 2, indicating high reproducibility. Model fits indicate that the response to melanopsin-directed contrast is prolonged relative to that elicited by cone-directed contrast. The group average cone- and melanopsin-directed pupil responses from Session 3 were highly similar to those from Sessions 1 and 2, suggesting that these responses are insensitive to background radiance over the range studied. The increase in radiance enhanced persistent pupil constriction to blue light. Conclusions The group average pupil response to stimuli designed through silent substitution provides a reliable probe of the function of a melanopsin-mediated system in humans. As disruption of the melanopsin system may relate to clinical pathology, the reproducibility of response suggests that silent substitution pupillometry can test if melanopsin signals differ between clinical groups.

Mutations in Shank3 are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders and circuit disfunction, but a unified view of how Shank3 loss disrupts circuit function and excitability is lacking. Stabilizing, homeostatic forms of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity are critical for preventing circuit hyper- or hypo-excitability, leading us to ask whether Shank3 loss perturbs circuits by disrupting homeostatic plasticity. We show that Shank3 loss abolishes synaptic and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity, which can be rescued by lithium, a drug with therapeutic potential in human Shankopathies. Further, Shank3 loss in vivo severely compromises the ability of visual cortical circuits to recover from perturbations to sensory drive. Our findings suggest that the loss of homeostatic compensation is a critical endophenotype that can explain a range of circuit disfunctions in Shankopathies.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a key regulator of cell apoptosis, has been described to accumulate in affected brain areas from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, whether p53 plays any role in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we found that exposure of neurons to oligomers of the amyloidogenic fragment 25-35 of the A{beta} peptide (A{beta}25-35) activated Cdk5, which promoted p53 protein phosphorylation and stabilization. Moreover, A{beta}25-35-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis were prevented by both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of either p53 or Cdk5 activities. To confirm this mechanism in vivo, A{beta}25-35 was stereotaxically injected in the cerebral right ventricle of mice, a treatment that caused p53 protein accumulation, dendrite disruption and neuronal death. Furthermore, these effects were prevented in p53 knockout mice or by pharmacologically inhibiting p53. Thus, A{beta}25-35 triggers Cdk5 activation to induce p53 phosphorylation and stabilization, which leads to neuronal damage. Inhibition of the Cdk5-p53 pathway may therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy against A{beta}-induced neurodegeneration.

Demyelination, axonal damage and inflammation are critical indicators of the onset and progress of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients. Due to physical limitations of imaging such as acquisition time and imaging resolution, a voxel in a MR image is heterogeneous in terms of tissue microstructure such as myelin, axons, intra and extra cellular fluids and free water. We present a multi-compartment tissue model which estimates the water fraction (WF) of tissues with short, medium and high T2 relaxation times in a T2 relaxometry MRI voxel. The proposed method is validated on test-retest data of healthy controls. This model was then used to study longitudinal trends of the tissue microstructures for two sub-regions of the lesions: gadolinium enhanced (E+) and non-enhanced (L-) regions of MS lesions in 10 MS patients over a period of three years. The water fraction values in E+ and L- regions were found to be significantly different (p&lt;0.05) over the period of first three months. The results of this study also showed that the estimates of the proposed T2 relaxometry model on brain tissue microstructures have potential to distinguish between regions undergoing active blood brain barrier breakdown from the other regions of the lesion.

From early on in life, children are able to use information from their environment to form predictions about events. For instance, they can use statistical information about a population to predict the sample drawn from that population and infer an agent's preferences from systematic violations of random sampling. We investigated how young children build and update models of an agent's sampling actions over time, and whether a computational model based on the causal Bayesian network formalization of Predictive Processing can explain this process. We formalized three hypotheses about how different explanatory variables (i.e., prior probabilities, current observations, and agent characteristics) are used to build predictive models of others' actions. We measured pupillary responses as a behavioral marker of 'prediction errors' (i.e., the perceived mismatch between what one's model of an agent predicts and what the agent actually does), as described in the Predictive Processing framework. Pupillary responses of 24-month-olds, but not 18-month-olds, showed that young children integrated information about current observations, priors and agents to generate predictive models of agents and their actions. These findings shed light on the mechanisms behind toddlers' inferences about agent-caused events. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which young children's pupillary responses are used as markers of prediction errors, and explained by a computational model based on the causal Bayesian network formalization of Predictive Processing. We argue that the Predictive Processing framework provides a promising explanation of the way in which young children process other persons' actions.

<p>by Xiuli Chen, Robb B. Rutledge, Harriet R. Brown, Raymond J. Dolan, Sven Bestmann, Joseph M. Galea</p>

Motor decision-making is an essential component of everyday life which requires weighing potential rewards and punishments against the probability of successfully executing an action. To achieve this, humans rely on two key mechanisms; a flexible, instrumental, value-dependent process and a hardwired, Pavlovian, value-independent process. In economic decision-making, age-related decline in risk taking is explained by reduced Pavlovian biases that promote action toward reward. Although healthy ageing has also been associated with decreased risk-taking in motor decision-making, it is currently unknown whether this is a result of changes in Pavlovian biases, instrumental processes or a combination of both. Using a newly established approach-avoidance computational model together with a novel app-based motor decision-making task, we measured sensitivity to reward and punishment when participants (n = 26,532) made a ‚Äògo/no-go‚Äô motor gamble based on their perceived ability to execute a complex action. We show that motor decision-making can be better explained by a model with both instrumental and Pavlovian parameters, and reveal age-related changes across punishment- and reward-based instrumental and Pavlovian processes. However, the most striking effect of ageing was a decrease in Pavlovian attraction towards rewards, which was associated with a reduction in optimality of choice behaviour. In a subset of participants who also played an independent economic decision-making task (n = 17,220), we found similar decision-making tendencies for motor and economic domains across a majority of age groups. Pavlovian biases, therefore, play an important role in not only explaining motor decision-making behaviour but also the changes which occur through normal ageing. This provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which shape motor decision-making across the lifespan.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7I9gI6jfrH8" width="1" />

<p>by Lukas Grossberger, Francesco P. Battaglia, Martin Vinck</p>

Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern ‚Äúnoise‚Äù spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ve-KmnATpsw" width="1" />

In experimental assays of angiogenesis in three-dimensional fibrin matrices, a temporary scaffold formed during wound healing, the type and composition of fibrin impacts the level of sprouting. More sprouts form on high molecular weight (HMW) than on low molecular weight (LMW) fibrin. It is unclear what mechanisms regulate the number and the positions of the vascular-like structures in cell cultures. To address this question, we propose a mechanistic simulation model of endothelial cell migration and fibrin proteolysis by the plasmin system. The model is a hybrid, cell-based and continuum, computational model based on the cellular Potts model and sets of partial-differential equations. Based on the model results, we propose that a positive feedback mechanism between uPAR, plasmin and transforming growth factor <i>Œ≤</i>1 (TGF<i>Œ≤</i>1) selects cells in the monolayer for matrix invasion. Invading cells releases TGF<i>Œ≤</i>1 from the extracellular matrix through plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation. The activated TGF<i>Œ≤</i>1 further stimulates fibrin degradation and keeps proteolysis active as the sprout invades the fibrin matrix. The binding capacity for TGF<i>Œ≤</i>1 of LMW is reduced relative to that of HMW. This leads to reduced activation of proteolysis and, consequently, reduced cell ingrowth in LMW fibrin compared to HMW fibrin. Thus our model predicts that endothelial cells in LMW fibrin matrices compared to HMW matrices show reduced sprouting due to a lower bio-availability of TGF<i>Œ≤</i>1.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dJeJLhtrNNo" width="1" />

<p>by Ankit N. Khambhati, John D. Medaglia, Elisabeth A. Karuza, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill, Danielle S. Bassett</p>

Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control‚Äîa set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasks‚Äîa Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures‚Äîeach with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XzG9sFK-qtk" width="1" />

<p>by Hesam Setareh, Moritz Deger, Wulfram Gerstner</p>

The time scale of neuronal network dynamics is determined by synaptic interactions and neuronal signal integration, both of which occur on the time scale of milliseconds. Yet many behaviors like the generation of movements or vocalizations of sounds occur on the much slower time scale of seconds. Here we ask the question of how neuronal networks of the brain can support reliable behavior on this time scale. We argue that excitable neuronal assemblies with spike-frequency adaptation may serve as building blocks that can flexibly adjust the speed of execution of neural circuit function. We show in simulations that a chain of neuronal assemblies can propagate signals reliably, similar to the well-known synfire chain, but with the crucial difference that the propagation speed is slower and tunable to the behaviorally relevant range. Moreover we study a grid of excitable neuronal assemblies as a simplified model of the somatosensory barrel cortex of the mouse and demonstrate that various patterns of experimentally observed spatial activity propagation can be explained.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7s2Bl1Mmz-s" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0414-17.2018v1?rss=1">Organization of Neural Population Code in Mouse Visual System</a></h4>

<p>The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This analysis is one of the first of the Allen Brain Observatory‚Äôs visual cortex dataset. The mouse has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to primates and carnivorous species as a model for studying visual perception. Mice offer the benefit of large-scale, high-throughput experiments and sophisticated genetic tools useful to investigating highly specific components of visual perception. Preliminary work in identifying the functional organization of mouse extrastriate areas has focused on single neurons and lacks analysis at the population level. Our population decoding analysis contributes novel evidence about the role of many distinct areas and layers of the mouse visual cortex in visual information processing to further establish the mouse as a viable model for future visual system research.</p>

<p><b>Significance Statement</b> Decision-making under risk entails the possibility of simultaneously receiving positive (reward) and negative (punishment) stimuli. To learn in this context, one must integrate conflicting information related to the magnitude of reward and the probability of punishment. Long-term inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) disrupts this process and increases risky behavior. In a recent study published in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>, Orisini et al., (2017) showed that briefly inhibiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) may result in increased or decreased risk-taking behavior, depending on the phase of the decision process in which BLA activity is disrupted. Here we discuss the results and propose future experiments that could improve our understanding of how the BLA contributes to adaptive learning under risk and uncertainty.</p>

Abstract<p>Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model ‚Äì with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology ‚Äì to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by spontaneous recurring seizures. TLE additionally features cognitive and affective comorbidities that impair quality of life. Animal models studying TLE are critical to advance our understanding of the disorder. A current popular model targets the dorsal hippocampus with a focal injection of kainic acid to induce epilepsy. Evidence suggest targeting the ventral hippocampus may produce a model of TLE with distinct benefits. We present data demonstrating that targeting the mouse ventral hippocampus with kainic acid creates a TLE model with similar seizure and cognitive phenotypes to the standard dorsal model but with additional, pronounced affective features, including anhedonia. These results describe a new tool for epilepsy researchers to better study comorbidities of TLE.</p>

<p>In this paper, we explore how Integrated Information Theory of consciousness
(IIT) has evolved and what problems are involved in the theory. IIT is a
hypothesis that consciousness can be explained in terms of integrated
information. It argues that a number of fundamental properties of experience
can be properly analyzed and explained by physical systems' informational
properties. Throughout the last decade, there have been many advances in IIT's
theoretical structure and mathematical model. In addition, as all hypotheses in
the field of science of consciousness, IIT has given rise to several
controversies and issues. In this context, a critical survey for IIT is
urgently needed. To this end, we first introduce fundamental concepts of IIT
and related issues. Thereafter, we discuss major transitions IIT has been
through and how they affect IIT. Finally, in the last section, some theoretical
issues involved in IIT's principles are presented. The paper concludes by
suggesting that, for the sake of future development, IIT should more seriously
take metacognitive accessibility to experience.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on local protein synthesis. Given the impact of epigenetics on memory, the intriguing question is whether epigenetic regulation influences mGluR-LTD as well. G9a/GLP histone lysine methyltransferase complex is crucial for brain development and goal-directed learning as well as for drug-addiction. In this study, we analyzed whether the epigenetic regulation by G9a/GLP complex affects mGluR-LTD in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of 5‚Äì7 weeks old male Wistar rats. In hippocampal slices with intact CA1 dendritic regions, inhibition of G9a/GLP activity abolished mGluR-LTD. The inhibition of this complex upregulated the expression of plasticity proteins like PKMŒ∂, which mediated the prevention of mGluR-LTD expression by regulating the NSF-GluA2-mediated trafficking of AMPA receptors towards the postsynaptic site. G9a/GLP inhibition during the induction of mGluR-LTD also downregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated-GluA2 and Arc. Interestingly, G9a/GLP inhibition could not impede the mGluR-LTD when the cell-body was severed. Our study highlights the role of G9a/GLP complex in intact neuronal network as a bidirectional switch; when turned on, it facilitates the expression of mGluR-LTD, and when turned off, it promotes the expression of long-term potentiation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the <span style="font-style: italic;">CPE</span> gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150<sup>Glued</sup>. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150<sup>Glued</sup> from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150<sup>Glued</sup> leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150<sup>Glued</sup> is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Elucidating axonal and dendritic projection patterns of individual neurons is a key for understanding the cytoarchitecture of neural circuits in the brain. This requires genetic approaches to achieve Golgi-like sparse labeling of desired types of neurons. Here, we explored a novel strategy of stochastic gene activation with regulated sparseness (STARS), in which the stochastic choice between 2 competing Cre-<span style="font-style: italic;">lox</span> recombination events is controlled by varying the <span style="font-style: italic;">lox</span> efficiency and cassette length. In a created STARS transgenic mouse crossed with various Cre driver lines, sparse neuronal labeling with a relatively uniform level of sparseness was achieved across different brain regions and cell types in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Tracing of individual type II peripheral auditory fibers revealed for the first time that they undergo experience-dependent developmental refinement, which is impaired by attenuating external sound input. Our results suggest that STARS strategy can be applied for circuit mapping and sparse gene manipulation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>When we speak, we get correlated sensory feedback from speech sounds and from the muscles and soft tissues of the vocal tract. Here we dissociate the contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to identify brain networks that underlie the somatic contribution to speech motor learning. The technique uses a robotic device that selectively alters somatosensory inputs in combination with resting-state fMRI scans that reveal learning-related changes in functional connectivity. A partial correlation analysis is used to identify connectivity changes that are not explained by the time course of activity in any other learning-related areas. This analysis revealed changes related to behavioral improvements in movement and separately, to changes in auditory perception: Speech motor adaptation itself was associated with connectivity changes that were primarily in non-motor areas of brain, specifically, to a strengthening of connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex and between presupplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, connectively changes associated with alterations to auditory perception were restricted to speech motor areas, specifically, primary motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our findings show that during adaptation, somatosensory inputs result in a broad range of changes in connectivity in areas associated with speech motor control and learning.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Research on memory has been a major focus in the neurosciences over the past decades. An important advance was achieved by Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who reported from the 1930s to the 1950s about experiential phenomena induced by electrical brain stimulation in humans, implying neuronal causation of memory. Since then, neuroscientists have addressed the topic of memory from a range of subdisciplines; however, these reports by Penfield and his group as well as those on patient H. M. by Brenda Milner at the same institution continue to be referenced as groundbreaking. Further experimental work by Nobel laureates Eric Kandel and John O‚ÄôKeefe, as well as by Edvard and May-Britt Moser related Penfield‚Äôs patient documentation to experiential phenomena. However, our reassessment of Penfield‚Äôs original patient documentation questions the stance that he had uncovered the ‚Äústorehouse of memories.‚Äù Human memory must be regarded more as context sensitive and as representative of an active reconstructive process, than as a simple recording of events. Hence, strategies aiming at naturalizing all phenomena of mind (including memory) to cellular and molecular mechanisms cannot convincingly refer to Penfield‚Äôs electrophysiological studies alone as evidence that memories are solely caused by neuronal firing patterns.</span>

<p>by Kaixi Tang, Colton G. Boudreau, Claire M. Brown, Anmar Khadra</p>

Focal adhesions are protein complexes that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. During migration, the growth and disassembly of these structures are spatiotemporally regulated, with new adhesions forming at the leading edge of the cell and mature adhesions disassembling at the rear. Signalling proteins and structural cytoskeletal components tightly regulate adhesion dynamics. Paxillin, an adaptor protein within adhesions, is one of these proteins. Its phosphorylation at serine 273 (S273) is crucial for maintaining fast adhesion assembly and disassembly. Paxillin is known to bind to a GIT1-Œ≤PIX-PAK1 complex, which increases the local activation of the small GTPase Rac. To understand quantitatively the behaviour of this system and how it relates to adhesion assembly/disassembly, we developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the small GTPases Rac and Rho as determined by paxillin S273 phosphorylation. Our model revealed that the system possesses bistability, where switching between uninduced (active Rho) and induced (active Rac) states can occur through a change in rate of paxillin phosphorylation or PAK1 activation. The bistable switch is characterized by the presence of memory, minimal change in the levels of active Rac and Rho within the induced and uninduced states, respectively, and the limited regime of monostability associated with the uninduced state. These results were validated experimentally by showing the presence of bimodality in adhesion assembly and disassembly rates, and demonstrating that Rac activity increases after treating Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with okadaic acid (a paxillin phosphatase inhibitor), followed by a modest recovery after 20 min washout. Spatial gradients of phosphorylated paxillin in a reaction-diffusion model gave rise to distinct regions of Rac and Rho activities, resembling polarization of a cell into front and rear. Perturbing several parameters of the model also revealed important insights into how signalling components upstream and downstream of paxillin phosphorylation affect dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Bo3nqD1NCA" width="1" />

Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (<i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> ME-model called <i>i</i>JL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> ME-models while using 1/5 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in <i>i</i>JL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal <i>in silico</i> media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cjOqyaA5KvQ" width="1" />

<p>Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8‚Äì30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers‚Äô subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e., 8‚Äì17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0116-18.2018v1?rss=1">Loss of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in a KCl-Induced Model of Episodic Headache Enhances CNS Drug Delivery</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) in the CNS is suggested as a common mechanism contributing to headache. Despite strong evidence for CNS involvement in headache disorders, drug development for headache disorders remains focused on peripheral targets. Difficulty in delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may partially account for this disparity. It is known, however, that BBB permeability is increased during several CNS pathologies. In this study, we investigated BBB changes in response to KCl-induced CSD events and subsequent allodynia in rats. Cortical KCl injection in awake, freely moving rats produced facial allodynia with peak intensity between 1.5 and 3 hours and CSD induction within 0.5 to 2 hours post-injection. Brain perfusion of <sup>14</sup>C-sucrose as a marker of BBB paracellular permeability revealed increased leak in the cortex, but not brainstem, beginning 0.5 hours post-KCl injection and resolving within 6 hours; no changes in tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin or claudin-5 expression were observed. Acute pre-treatment with topiramate to inhibit CSD did not prevent the increased BBB paracellular permeability. CNS delivery of the abortive anti-migraine agent sumatriptan was increased in the cortex 1.5 hours post-KCl injection. Surprisingly, sumatriptan uptake was also increased in the brainstem following CSD induction, suggesting regulation of active transport mechanisms at the BBB. Together these results demonstrate the ability of CSD events to produce transient, time-dependent changes in BBB permeability when allodynia is present and to mediate access of clinically relevant therapeutics (i.e., sumatriptan) to the CNS.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The need to overcome the BBB is one of the major hurdles in designing CNS active drugs. CNS mechanisms have been shown to play a vital role in primary and secondary headache disorders. In this study we show that BBB permeability is transiently increased in a rat model of CSD induced episodic headache. We also observed a significant increase in sumatriptan uptake into the brain. Clinically, sumatriptan has been shown to be most efficacious when given close to the onset of headache pain, corresponding to times where we observed increased CNS uptake in our rat model. These data suggest that altered BBB permeability occurs during CSD and may be taken advantage of during therapeutic intervention.</p>

Abstract
<p>The chemical signal of light onset, a decrease in glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors, is processed by a postsynaptic G protein signaling cascade in ON-bipolar cells (BPCs). The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, along with other cascade elements, is localized synaptically at the BPC dendritic tips. The effector ion channel protein transient receptor potential melastatin-1 (TRPM1), in contrast, is located not only at the dendritic tips but also in BPC bodies and axons. Little is known about the intracellular localization of TRPM1, or its trafficking route to the dendritic tip plasma membrane. Recombinant TRPM1 expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, with little or none detected at the plasma membrane. In mouse retina, somatic TRPM1 was similarly intracellular, and not at the plasma membrane. Labeling of ER membranes by expression of a fluorescent marker showed that in BPCs the ER extends into axons and dendrites, but not dendritic tips. In cell bodies, TRPM1 colocalized with the ER, and not with the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescence protease protection (FPP) assays with TRPM1-GFP fusions in heterologous cells revealed that the N and C termini are both accessible to the cytoplasm, consistent with the transmembrane domain topology of related TRP channels. These results indicate that the majority of TRPM1 is present in the ER, from which it can potentially be transported to the dendritic tips as needed for ON light responses. The excess of ER-resident TRPM1 relative to the amount needed at the dendritic tips suggests a potential new function for TRPM1 in the ER.</p>

<p>For utilization of robotic assistive devices in everyday life, means for
detection and processing of erroneous robot actions are a focal aspect in the
development of collaborative systems, especially when controlled via brain
signals. Though, the variety of possible scenarios and the diversity of used
robotic systems pose a challenge for error decoding from recordings of brain
signals such as via EEG. For example, it is unclear whether humanoid
appearances of robotic assistants have an influence on the performance. In this
paper, we designed a study in which two different robots executed the same task
both in an erroneous and a correct manner. We find error-related EEG signals of
human observers indicating that the performance of the error decoding was
independent of robot design. However, we can show that it was possible to
identify which robot performed the instructed task by means of the EEG signals.
In this case, deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could reach
significantly higher ac curacies than both regularized Linear Discriminanat
Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) combined with
rLDA. Our findings indicate that decoding information about robot action
success from the EEG, particularly when using deep neural networks, may be an
applicable approach for a broad range of robot designs.

<p>NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) typically contribute to excitatory synaptic
transmission in the central nervous system. While calcium influx through NMDA-R
plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, indirect experimental evidence
also exists demonstrating actions of NMDAR-mediated calcium influx on neuronal
excitability through the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels.
But, so far, this mechanism has not been studied theoretically. Our theoretical
model provide a simple description of neuronal electrical activity including
the tonic activity of NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment. We
show that calcium influx through NMDA-R can directly be coupled to activation
of calcium-activated potassium channels providing an overall inhibitory effect
on neuronal excitability. Furthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity
promotes bistability in electrical activity by dramatically increasing the
stimulus interval where both a stable steady state and repetitive firing can
exist. This results could provide an intrinsic mechanism for the constitution
of memory traces in neuronal circuits. They also shed light on the way by which
beta-amyloids can decrease neuronal activity when interfering with NMDA-R in
Alzheimer's disease.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01479">Homeostatic plasticity and external input shape neural network dynamics. (arXiv:1807.01479v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in
vitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking
activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling
considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics
and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro
and in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are
virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.
We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by
spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.
In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network
topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic
plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to
close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the
dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the
input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in
vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state
generated by very low network input (&lt; 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests
that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in
reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the
ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics
comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term
stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in
vitro for basic as well as neurological studies.

<p>In this paper, we propose a shot noise-based leaky integrated and firing
neuron model and provide a detailed analysis of the performance of this model
compared to the traditional diffusion approximated model. In theoretical
neuroscience, there are three general neuron models in the field: Compartmental
neuron model is a conductance-based model, in which it views the biological
neurons as a large circuit. The problem of this model comes from its structural
complexity and the number of its free parameters; Leaky integrated and firing
model is a more flexible model due to the special design called
threshold-resetting, in which the voltage of the neuron is reset after reaching
the threshold. This model is proposed as an alternative to the compartment
model to provide a more biologically realistic model that can capture spike
timing behaviors that are observed in experiments. In addition to that, it is
more computationally efficient since it has much less free parameters; Firing
rate-based neuron model uses the firing rate of the neuron as the coupling
terms in the coupled neuronal network models. Models of this kind can be easily
analyzed on the network level. Theoretical analysis for this model proves the
existence of phase transition and shows that the computational capacity is
boosted in the chaotic regime.

Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, affecting 1 in 1,000 live births and representing up to 3% of all pediatric hospital charges. Using data from the largest CH exome sequencing study to date, Furey et¬†al. identify four genes (TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTCH1, and SHH) not previously implicated in CH. Remarkably, all four genes regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate and, together, explain ‚àº10% of CH cases. These findings implicate impaired neurogenesis in pathogenesis of a significant number of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.

<p>Familiarity of the environment changes the way we perceive and encode incoming information. However, the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we describe a new form of experience-dependent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake adult male mice. The oscillations emerged in visually evoked potentials and single-unit activity following repeated visual stimulation. The oscillations were sensitive to the spatial frequency content of a visual stimulus and required the mAChRs for their induction and expression. Finally, ongoing visually evoked  (4‚Äì8 Hz) oscillations boost the visually evoked potential amplitude of incoming visual stimuli if the stimuli are presented at the high excitability phase of the oscillations. Our results demonstrate that an oscillatory code can be used to encode familiarity and serves as a gate for oncoming sensory inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous experience can influence the processing of incoming sensory information by the brain and alter perception. However, the mechanistic understanding of how this process takes place is lacking. We have discovered that persistent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex encode information about familiarity and the spatial frequency of the stimulus. These familiarity evoked oscillations influence neuronal responses to the oncoming stimuli in a way that depends on the oscillation phase. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of visual stimulus feature detection and learning.</p>

<p>Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption ("binge drinking") occur frequently among adolescents, and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I<sub>h</sub>) and in intrinsic persistent activity (a mode of neuronal firing that is dependent on I<sub>h</sub>). Many of these effects on intrinsic excitability were sustained following abstinence and observed in mice that showed working memory deficits. In addition, we found that resting membrane potential and the I<sub>h</sub>-dependent voltage "sag" in prelimbic PFC PNs are developmentally regulated during adolescence, suggesting that adolescent alcohol exposure may compromise PFC function by arresting the normal developmental trajectory of PN intrinsic excitability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has negative consequences for the function of the developing PFC. Using a mouse model of voluntary binge drinking during adolescence, we found that this behavior leads to working memory deficits and altered drinking behavior in adulthood. In addition, we found that adolescent drinking is associated with specific changes to the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, reducing the ability of these neurons to generate intrinsic persistent activity, a phenomenon thought to be important for working memory. These findings may help explain why human adolescent binge drinkers show performance deficits on tasks mediated by the PFC.</p>

<p>The reticular formation is important in primate motor control, both in health and during recovery after brain damage. Little is known about the different neurons present in the reticular nuclei. Here we recorded extracellular spikes from the reticular formation in five healthy female awake behaving monkeys (193 cells), and in two female monkeys 1 year after recovery from a unilateral pyramidal tract lesion (125 cells). Analysis of spike shape and four measures derived from the interspike interval distribution identified four clusters of neurons in control animals. Cluster 1 cells had a slow firing rate. Cluster 2 cells had narrow spikes and irregular firing, which often included high-frequency bursts. Cluster 3 cells were highly rhythmic and fast firing. Cluster 4 cells showed negative spikes. A separate population of 42 cells was antidromically identified as reticulospinal neurons in five anesthetized female monkeys. The distribution of spike width in these cells closely overlaid the distribution for cluster 2, leading us tentatively to suggest that cluster 2 included neurons with reticulospinal projections. In animals after corticospinal lesion, cells could be identified in all four clusters. The firing rate of cells in clusters 1 and 2 was increased in lesioned animals relative to control animals (by 52% and 60%, respectively); cells in cluster 2 were also more regular and more bursting in the lesioned animals. We suggest that changes in both membrane properties and local circuits within the reticular formation occur following lesioning, potentially increasing reticulospinal output to help compensate for lost corticospinal descending drive.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work is the first to subclassify neurons in the reticular formation, providing insights into the local circuitry of this important but little understood structure. The approach developed can be applied to any extracellular recording from this region, allowing future studies to place their data within our current framework of four neural types. Changes in reticular neurons may be important to subserve functional recovery after damage in human patients, such as after stroke or spinal cord injury.</p>

<p>Sensory systems do not develop and function independently of one another, yet they are typically studied in isolation. Effects of multisensory interactions on the developing neocortex can be revealed by altering the ratios of incoming sensory inputs associated with different modalities. We investigated neural responses in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of short-tailed opossums (<i>Monodelphis domestica</i>; either sex) after the elimination of visual input through bilateral enucleation very early in development. To assess the influence of tactile experience after vision loss, we also examined naturally occurring patterns of exploratory behavior. In early blind (EB) animals, overall levels of tactile experience were similar to those of sighted controls (SC); locomotor activity was unimpaired and accompanied by whisking. Using extracellular single-unit recording techniques under anesthesia, we found that EB animals exhibited a reduction in the magnitude of neural responses to whisker stimuli in S1, coupled with spatial sharpening of receptive fields, in comparison to SC animals. These alterations manifested as two different effects on sensory processing in S1 of EB animals: the ability of neurons to detect single whisker stimulation was decreased, whereas their ability to discriminate between stimulation of neighboring whiskers was enhanced. The increased selectivity of S1 neurons in EB animals was reflected in improved population decoding performance for whisker stimulus position, particularly along the rostrocaudal axis of the snout, which aligns with the primary axis of natural whisker motion. These findings suggest that a functionally distinct form of somatosensory plasticity occurs when vision is lost early in development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> After sensory loss, compensatory behavior mediated through the spared senses could be generated entirely through the recruitment of brain areas associated with the deprived sense. Alternatively, functional compensation in spared modalities may be achieved through a combination of plasticity in brain areas corresponding to both spared and deprived sensory modalities. Although activation of neurons in cortex associated with a deprived sense has been described frequently, it is unclear whether this is the only substrate available for compensation or if plasticity within cortical fields corresponding to spared modalities, particularly primary sensory cortices, may also contribute. Here, we demonstrate empirically that early loss of vision alters coding of sensory inputs in primary somatosensory cortex in a manner that supports enhanced tactile discrimination.</p>

<p>Light is one of the chief environmental cues that reset circadian clocks. In <i>Drosophila</i>, CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) mediates acute photic resetting of circadian clocks by promoting the degradation of TIMELESS in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, even circadian oscillators in peripheral organs can independently perceive light in <i>Drosophila</i>. However, there is substantial evidence for nonautonomous mechanisms of circadian photoreception in the brain. We have previously shown that the morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators are critical light-sensing neurons that cooperate to shift the phase of circadian behavior in response to light input. We show here that light can efficiently phase delay or phase advance circadian locomotor behavior in male <i>Drosophila</i> even when either the M- or the E-oscillators are ablated, suggesting that behavioral phase shifts and their directionality are largely a consequence of the cell-autonomous nature of CRY-dependent photoreception. Our observation that the phase response curves of brain and peripheral oscillators are remarkably similar further supports this idea. Nevertheless, the neural network modulates circadian photoresponses. We show that the M-oscillator neurotransmitter pigment dispersing factor plays a critical role in the coordination between M- and E-oscillators after light exposure, and we uncover a potential role for a subset of dorsal neurons in the control of phase advances. Thus, neural modulation of autonomous light detection might play an important role in the plasticity of circadian behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Input pathways provide circadian rhythms with the flexibility needed to harmonize their phase with environmental cycles. Light is the chief environmental cue that synchronizes circadian clocks. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME resets circadian clocks cell-autonomously. However, recent studies indicate that, in the brain, interactions between clock neurons are critical to reset circadian locomotor behavior. We present evidence supporting the idea that the ability of flies to advance or delay their rhythmic behavior in response to light input essentially results from cell-autonomous photoreception. However, because of their networked organization, we find that circadian neurons have to cooperate to reset the phase of circadian behavior in response to photic cues. Our work thus helps to reconcile cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous models of circadian entrainment.</p>

<p>Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 is an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 L-type channels that regulate the development and mature exocytotic function of the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. In humans, mutations in the <i>CACNA2D4</i> gene encoding Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 cause heterogeneous forms of vision impairment in humans, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of which remain unclear. To investigate the retinal function of Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4, we used genome editing to generate an Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 knock-out (Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 KO) mouse. In male and female Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 KO mice, rod spherules lack ribbons and other synaptic hallmarks early in development. Although the molecular organization of cone synapses is less affected than rod synapses, horizontal and cone bipolar processes extend abnormally in the outer nuclear layer in Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 KO retina. In reconstructions of Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 KO cone pedicles by serial block face scanning electron microscopy, ribbons appear normal, except that less than one-third show the expected triadic organization of processes at ribbon sites. The severity of the synaptic defects in Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 KO mice correlates with a progressive loss of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels, first in terminals of rods and later cones. Despite the absence of b-waves in electroretinograms, visually guided behavior is evident in Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 KO mice and better under photopic than scotopic conditions. We conclude that Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4 plays an essential role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of rod and cone synapses, the disruption of which may contribute to visual impairment in humans with <i>CACNA2D4</i> mutations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the retina, visual information is first communicated by the synapse formed between photoreceptors and second-order neurons. The mechanisms that regulate the structural integrity of this synapse are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a role for Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4, a subunit of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, in organizing the structure and function of photoreceptor synapses. We find that presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are progressively lost and that rod and cone synapses are disrupted in mice that lack Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4. Our results suggest that alterations in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and photoreceptor synapse structure may contribute to vision impairment in humans with mutations in the <i>CACNA2D4</i> gene encoding Œ±<sub>2</sub>-4.</p>

<p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs), composed mainly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, are the extracellular matrix that surrounds cell bodies, proximal dendrites, and axon initial segments of adult CNS neurons. PNNs are known to regulate neuronal plasticity, although their physiological roles in cerebellar functions have yet to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the contribution of PNNs to GABAergic transmission from cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) to large glutamatergic neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) in male mice by recording IPSCs from cerebellar slices, in which PNNs were depleted with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC). We found that PNN depletion increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs and enhanced the paired-pulse depression. ChABC treatment also facilitated spontaneous IPSCs and increased the miniature IPSC frequency without changing not only the amplitude but also the density of PC terminals, suggesting that PNN depletion enhances presynaptic GABA release. We also demonstrated that the enhanced GABAergic transmission facilitated rebound firing in large glutamatergic DCN neurons, which is expected to result in the efficient induction of synaptic plasticity at synapses onto DCN neurons. Furthermore, we tested whether PNN depletion affects cerebellar motor learning. Mice having received the enzyme into the interpositus nuclei, which are responsible for delay eyeblink conditioning, exhibited the conditioned response at a significantly higher rate than control mice. Therefore, our results suggest that PNNs of the DCN suppress GABAergic transmission between PCs and large glutamatergic DCN neurons and restrict synaptic plasticity associated with motor learning in the adult cerebellum.</p>

Here we found that enzymatic PNN depletion in the mouse deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) reduced the paired-pulse ratio of IPSCs and increased the miniature IPSC frequency without changing the amplitude, suggesting that PNN depletion enhances GABA release from the presynaptic Purkinje cell (PC) terminals. Mice having received the enzyme in the interpositus nuclei exhibited a higher conditioned response rate in delay eyeblink conditioning than control mice. These results suggest that PNNs regulate presynaptic functions of PC terminals in the DCN and functional plasticity of synapses on DCN neurons, which influences the flexibility of adult cerebellar functions.</p>

<p>The ability to adapt behavior to environmental fluctuations is critical for survival of organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can learn to avoid sodium chloride when it is paired with starvation. This behavior may help animals avoid areas without food. Although some genes have been implicated in this salt-aversive learning behavior, critical genetic components, and the neural circuit in which they act, remain elusive. Here, we show that the sole worm ortholog of mammalian CaMKI/IV, CMK-1, is essential for salt-aversive learning behavior in <i>C. elegans</i> hermaphrodites. We find that CMK-1 acts in the primary salt-sensing ASE neurons to regulate this behavior. By characterizing the intracellular calcium dynamics in ASE neurons using microfluidics, we find that loss of <i>cmk-1</i> has subtle effects on sensory-evoked calcium responses in ASE axons and their modulation by salt conditioning. Our study implicates the expression of the conserved CaMKI/CMK-1 in chemosensory neurons as a regulator of behavioral plasticity to environmental salt in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Like other animals, the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> depends on salt for survival and navigates toward high concentrations of this essential mineral. In addition to its role as an essential nutrient, salt also causes osmotic stress at high concentrations. A growing body of evidence indicates that <i>C. elegans</i> balances the requirement for salt with the danger it presents through a process called salt-aversive learning. We show that this behavior depends on expression of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, CMK-1, in the ASE salt-sensing neurons. Our study identifies CMK-1 and salt-sensitive chemosensory neurons as key factors in this form of behavioral plasticity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6102?rss=1">Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) Regulates Neuronal Activity by Controlling GABABR Trafficking</a></h4>

<p>Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) has been postulated as a key regulator of learning and memory. We previously reported that specific hippocampal ATF4 downregulation causes deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory and reduction of glutamatergic functionality. Here we extend our studies to address ATF4's role in neuronal excitability. We find that long-term ATF4 knockdown in cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly increases the frequency of spontaneous action potentials. This effect is associated with decreased functionality of metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs). Knocking down ATF4 results in significant reduction of GABA<sub>B</sub>R-induced GIRK currents and increased mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, reducing ATF4 significantly decreases expression of membrane-exposed, but not total, GABA<sub>B</sub>R 1a and 1b subunits, indicating that ATF4 regulates GABA<sub>B</sub>R trafficking. In contrast, ATF4 knockdown has no effect on surface expression of GABA<sub>B</sub>R2s, several GABA<sub>B</sub>R-coupled ion channels or Œ≤2 and 2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Pharmacologic manipulations confirmed the relationship between GABA<sub>B</sub>R functionality and action potential frequency in our cultures. Specifically, the effects of ATF4 downregulation cited above are fully rescued by transcriptionally active, but not by transcriptionally inactive, shRNA-resistant, ATF4. We previously reported that ATF4 promotes stabilization of the actin-regulatory protein Cdc42 by a transcription-dependent mechanism. To test the hypothesis that this action underlies the mechanism by which ATF4 loss affects neuronal firing rates and GABA<sub>B</sub>R trafficking, we downregulated Cdc42 and found that this phenocopies the effects of ATF4 knockdown on these properties. In conclusion, our data favor a model in which ATF4, by regulating Cdc42 expression, affects trafficking of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs, which in turn modulates the excitability properties of neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs), the metabotropic receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, have crucial roles in controlling the firing rate of neurons. Deficits in trafficking/functionality of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs have been linked to a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and pain. Here we show that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs trafficking is influenced by Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), a protein that has a pivotal role in hippocampal memory processes. We found that ATF4 downregulation in hippocampal neurons reduces membrane-bound GABA<sub>B</sub>R levels and thereby increases intrinsic excitability. These effects are mediated by loss of the small GTPase Cdc42 following ATF4 downregulation. These findings reveal a critical role for ATF4 in regulating the modulation of neuronal excitability by GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs.</p>

<p>Nerve injury-induced hyperactivity of primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contributes to chronic pain development, but the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we determined genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in the nervous system in neuropathic pain. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL), but not paclitaxel treatment, in male Sprague Dawley rats induced a consistent low-level hypomethylation in the CpG sites in the DRG during the acute and chronic phases of neuropathic pain. DNA methylation remodeling in the DRG occurred early after SNL and persisted for at least 3 weeks. SNL caused DNA methylation changes at 8% of CpG sites with prevailing hypomethylation outside of CpG islands, in introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive sequences. In contrast, SNL caused more gains of methylation in the spinal cord and prefrontal cortex. The DNA methylation changes in the injured DRGs recapitulated developmental reprogramming at the neonatal stage. Methylation reprogramming was correlated with increased gene expression variability. A diet deficient in methyl donors induced hypomethylation and pain hypersensitivity. Intrathecal administration of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG108 caused long-lasting pain hypersensitivity. DNA methylation reprogramming in the DRG thus contributes to nerve injury-induced chronic pain. Restoring DNA methylation may represent a new therapeutic approach to treat neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epigenetic mechanisms are critically involved in the transition from acute to chronic pain after nerve injury. However, genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in the nervous system and their roles in neuropathic pain development remain unclear. Here we used digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation to quantitatively determine genome-wide DNA methylation changes caused by nerve injury. We showed that nerve injury caused DNA methylation changes at 8% of CpG sites with prevailing hypomethylation outside of CpG islands in the dorsal root ganglion. Reducing DNA methylation induced pain hypersensitivity, whereas increasing DNA methylation attenuated neuropathic pain. These findings extend our understanding of the epigenetic mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain and suggest new strategies to treat nerve injury-induced chronic pain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6076?rss=1">Neural Prediction Errors Distinguish Perception and Misperception of Speech</a></h4>

<p>Humans use prior expectations to improve perception, especially of sensory signals that are degraded or ambiguous. However, if sensory input deviates from prior expectations, then correct perception depends on adjusting or rejecting prior expectations. Failure to adjust or reject the prior leads to perceptual illusions, especially if there is partial overlap (and thus partial mismatch) between expectations and input. With speech, "slips of the ear" occur when expectations lead to misperception. For instance, an entomologist might be more susceptible to hear "The ants are my friends" for "The answer, my friend" (in the Bob Dylan song <i>Blowing in the Wind</i>). Here, we contrast two mechanisms by which prior expectations may lead to misperception of degraded speech. First, clear representations of the common sounds in the prior and input (i.e., expected sounds) may lead to incorrect confirmation of the prior. Second, insufficient representations of sounds that deviate between prior and input (i.e., prediction errors) could lead to deception. We used crossmodal predictions from written words that partially match degraded speech to compare neural responses when male and female human listeners were deceived into accepting the prior or correctly reject it. Combined behavioral and multivariate representational similarity analysis of fMRI data show that veridical perception of degraded speech is signaled by representations of prediction error in the left superior temporal sulcus. Instead of using top-down processes to support perception of expected sensory input, our findings suggest that the strength of neural prediction error representations distinguishes correct perception and misperception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Misperceiving spoken words is an everyday experience, with outcomes that range from shared amusement to serious miscommunication. For hearing-impaired individuals, frequent misperception can lead to social withdrawal and isolation, with severe consequences for wellbeing. In this work, we specify the neural mechanisms by which prior expectations, which are so often helpful for perception, can lead to misperception of degraded sensory signals. Most descriptive theories of illusory perception explain misperception as arising from a clear sensory representation of features or sounds that are in common between prior expectations and sensory input. Our work instead provides support for a complementary proposal: that misperception occurs when there is an insufficient sensory representations of the deviation between expectations and sensory signals.</p>

<p>Action potential conduction along myelinated axons depends on high densities of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels at the nodes of Ranvier. Flanking each node, paranodal junctions (paranodes) are formed between axons and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or oligodendrocytes in the CNS. Paranodal junctions contribute to both node assembly and maintenance. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms responsible for paranode assembly and maintenance remain poorly understood. Œ≤II spectrin is expressed in diverse cells and is an essential part of the submembranous cytoskeleton. Here, we show that Schwann cell Œ≤II spectrin is highly enriched at paranodes. To elucidate the roles of glial Œ≤II spectrin, we generated mutant mice lacking Œ≤II spectrin in myelinating glial cells by crossing mice with a floxed allele of <i>Sptbn1</i> with <i>Cnp-Cre</i> mice, and analyzed both male and female mice. Juvenile (4 weeks) and middle-aged (60 weeks) mutant mice showed reduced grip strength and sciatic nerve conduction slowing, whereas no phenotype was observed between 8 and 24 weeks of age. Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed disorganized paranodes in the PNS and CNS of both postnatal day 13 and middle-aged mutant mice, but not in young adult mutant mice. Electron microscopy confirmed partial loss of transverse bands at the paranodal axoglial junction in the middle-aged mutant mice in both the PNS and CNS. These findings demonstrate that a spectrin-based cytoskeleton in myelinating glia contributes to formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelinating glia form paranodal axoglial junctions that flank both sides of the nodes of Ranvier. These junctions contribute to node formation and maintenance and are essential for proper nervous system function. We found that a submembranous spectrin cytoskeleton is highly enriched at paranodes in Schwann cells. Ablation of Œ≤II spectrin in myelinating glial cells disrupted the paranodal cell adhesion complex in both peripheral and CNSs, resulting in muscle weakness and sciatic nerve conduction slowing in juvenile and middle-aged mice. Our data show that a spectrin-based submembranous cytoskeleton in myelinating glia plays important roles in paranode formation and maintenance.</p>

<p>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is among the most prevalent dementias of early-onset. Pathologically, FTLD presents with tauopathy or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy. A biallelic mouse model of FTLD was produced on a mix FVB/129SVE background overexpressing wild-type human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) using tetracycline transactivator (tTA), a system widely used in mouse models of neurological disorders. tTA activates hTDP-43, which is placed downstream of the tetracycline response element. The original study on this transgenic mouse found hippocampal degeneration following hTDP-43 expression, but did not account for independent effects of tTA protein. Here, we initially analyzed the neurotoxic effects of tTA in postweaning age mice of either sex using immunostaining and area measurements of select brain regions. We observed tTA-dependent toxicity selectively in the hippocampus affecting the dentate gyrus significantly more than CA fields, whereas hTDP-43-dependent toxicity in bigenic mice occurred in most other cortical regions. Atrophy was associated with inflammation, activation of caspase-3, and loss of neurons. The atrophy associated with tTA expression was rescuable by the tetracycline analog, doxycycline, in the diet. MRI studies corroborated the patterns of atrophy. tTA-induced degeneration was strain-dependent and was rescued by moving the transgene onto a congenic C57BL/6 background. Despite significant hippocampal atrophy, behavioral tests in bigenic mice revealed no hippocampally mediated memory impairment. Significant atrophy in most cortical areas due solely to TDP-43 expression indicates that this mouse model remains useful for providing critical insight into co-occurrence of TDP-43 pathology, neurodegeneration, and behavioral deficits in FTLD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The tTA expression system has been widely used in mice to model neurological disorders. The technique allows investigators to reversibly turn on or off disease causing genes. Here, we report on a mouse model that overexpresses human TDP-43 using tTA and attempt to recapitulate features of TDP-43 pathology present in human FTLD. The tTA expression system is problematic, resulting in dramatic degeneration of the hippocampus. Thus, our study adds a note of caution for the use of the tTA system. However, because FTLD is primarily characterized by cortical degeneration and our mouse model shows significant atrophy in most cortical areas due to human TDP-43 overexpression, our animal model remains useful for providing critical insight on this human disease.</p>

<p>Understanding visual perceptual learning (VPL) has become increasingly more challenging as new phenomena are discovered with novel stimuli and training paradigms. Although existing models aid our knowledge of critical aspects of VPL, the connections shown by these models between behavioral learning and plasticity across different brain areas are typically superficial. Most models explain VPL as readout from simple perceptual representations to decision areas and are not easily adaptable to explain new findings. Here, we show that a well -known instance of deep neural network (DNN), whereas not designed specifically for VPL, provides a computational model of VPL with enough complexity to be studied at many levels of analyses. After learning a Gabor orientation discrimination task, the DNN model reproduced key behavioral results, including increasing specificity with higher task precision, and also suggested that learning precise discriminations could transfer asymmetrically to coarse discriminations when the stimulus conditions varied. Consistent with the behavioral findings, the distribution of plasticity moved toward lower layers when task precision increased and this distribution was also modulated by tasks with different stimulus types. Furthermore, learning in the network units demonstrated close resemblance to extant electrophysiological recordings in monkey visual areas. Altogether, the DNN fulfilled predictions of existing theories regarding specificity and plasticity and reproduced findings of tuning changes in neurons of the primate visual areas. Although the comparisons were mostly qualitative, the DNN provides a new method of studying VPL, can serve as a test bed for theories, and assists in generating predictions for physiological investigations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual perceptual learning (VPL) has been found to cause changes at multiple stages of the visual hierarchy. We found that training a deep neural network (DNN) on an orientation discrimination task produced behavioral and physiological patterns similar to those found in human and monkey experiments. Unlike existing VPL models, the DNN was pre-trained on natural images to reach high performance in object recognition, but was not designed specifically for VPL; however, it fulfilled predictions of existing theories regarding specificity and plasticity and reproduced findings of tuning changes in neurons of the primate visual areas. When used with care, this unbiased and deep-hierarchical model can provide new ways of studying VPL from behavior to physiology.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TU2UMRsefhw/article">Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry</a></h4>

<p>by Felix Brinkmann, Moritz Mercker, Thomas Richter, Anna Marciniak-Czochra</p>

Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously arising from specific chemical interactions (such as ‚ÄúTuring-patterns‚Äù). Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development. On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TU2UMRsefhw" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, <i>Hirudo verbana</i>, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.</p>

Abstract<p>Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Addiction is known to encompass heterogeneity in its development, maintenance, and treatment response. While previous work has mostly focused on the common mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities in addiction at a group level, the neurocomputational causes for such intersubject variability in addition are not well-understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine a neural and a reinforcement learning model to reveal that the balance between neural circuits or computational control modalities characterizes the presence of behavioral phenotypes in addiction. The presence of converging effects, validated across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, informs on a quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity, and potentially helps future development of precision treatments.</p>

Abstract<p>The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-<i>fos</i> regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a <i>fos</i>-<i>tau-LacZ</i> (<i>FTL</i>) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (<i>FTL<sup>+</sup></i>) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in <i>FTL<sup>+</sup></i> neurons when compared to non-activated <i>FTL<sup>-</sup></i> neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on Œ≤-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0420-17.2018?rss=1">Chronometry on Spike-LFP Responses Reveals the Functional Neural Circuitry of Early Auditory Cortex Underlying Sound Processing and Discrimination</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: (1) onset latency, time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli; and (2) selection latency, time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones (PTs), yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations ("Coos"). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.</p>

A key component of current theories of brain structure and function is the layer-specific origin of structural connections of the cerebral cortex. This fundamental connectional feature pertains to different mammalian cortices, and recent neuroimaging advancements have started to pave the way for its function-based mapping in humans. Here, we propose a framework that systematically explains the characteristic layer-specific origin of structural connections and its graded variation across the cortical sheet and across mammalian species.

<p>by Bernardo A. Mello, Wenlin Pan, Gerald L. Hazelbauer, Yuhai Tu</p>

It is challenging to decipher molecular mechanisms in biological systems from system-level input-output data, especially for complex processes that involve interactions among multiple components. We addressed this general problem for the bacterial histidine kinase CheA, the activity of which is regulated in chemotaxis signaling complexes by bacterial chemoreceptors. We developed a general network model to describe the dynamics of the system, treating the receptor complex with coupling protein CheW and the P3P4P5 domains of kinase CheA as a regulated enzyme with two substrates, ATP and P1, the phosphoryl-accepting domain of CheA. Our simple network model allowed us to search hypothesis space systematically. For different and progressively more complex regulation schemes, we fit our models to a large set of input-output data with the aim of identifying the simplest possible regulation mechanisms consistent with the data. Our modeling and analysis revealed novel dual regulation mechanisms in which receptor activity regulated ATP binding plus one other process, either P1 binding or phosphoryl transfer between P1 and ATP. Strikingly, in our models receptor control affected the kinetic rate constants of substrate association and dissociation equally and thus did not alter the respective equilibrium constants. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between the two dual-regulation mechanisms. This systems-biology approach of combining modeling and a large input-output dataset should be applicable for studying other complex biological processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/55xMZx8_bX8" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine if maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or <i>Celf6</i><sup>+/-</sup> mouse dams to fluoxetine during different periods of gestation and lactation, and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. <i>Celf6</i> mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal fluoxetine treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Human epidemiological studies suggest that taking antidepressants during pregnancy may increase risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Since only women with a diagnosis take antidepressants, there is substantial debate on whether all increased ASD risk is contributed by the diagnosis, or if medication has an additional influence. We reasoned empirical studies in a reduced system might provide some indication if there was biological basis for such an influence. Our mouse studies show that, in the absence of other maternal manipulations or stressors, maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure alone can alter the behavioral circuits for sensory, social and repetitive behaviors, relevant to ASD, in a mammalian brain, and that some of these changes are reversible by SSRI re-exposure.</p>

Abstract<p>Human adolescence is a period of rapid changes in cognition and goal-directed behavior, and constitutes a major transitional phase towards adulthood. One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie the protracted maturation of functional brain networks, is the increased network integration and segregation enhancing neural efficiency. Importantly, the increasing coordinated network interplay throughout development is mediated through functional hubs, which are highly connected brain areas suggested to be pivotal nodes for the regulation of neural activity. To elucidate brain hub development during childhood and adolescence, we estimated voxel-wise eigenvector centrality (EC) using fMRI data from two different psychological contexts (resting state and a working memory task), in a large cross-sectional sample (n = 754) spanning the age from 8-22 years, and decomposed the maps using independent component analysis. Our results reveal significant age-related centrality differences in cingulo-opercular, visual and sensorimotor network nodes during both rest and task performance, suggesting that common neurodevelopmental processes manifest across different mental states. Supporting the functional significance of these developmental patterns, the centrality of the cingulo-opercular node was positively associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence for protracted maturation of hub properties in specific nodes of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence, and suggest that cingulo-opercular centrality is a key factor supporting neurocognitive development.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Adolescence is a sensitive period during ontogeny and a maturational gateway to adulthood. A better characterization of the brain changes underpinning cognitive and emotional development occurring during this period is key to inform models of normal and abnormal adaptation. Advanced brain imaging allows for <i>in vivo</i> studies of the protracted maturation of brain network function and connectivity during childhood and adolescence. Here, we used functional brain imaging to identify neural hubs during two psychological contexts in 754 children and adolescents. Key regions of the brain network showed increasing importance through adolescence, and individual differences in working memory performance was associated with the centrality of cingulo-opercular network nodes, suggesting a hot-spot for neurocognitive development.</p>

Abstract
<p>Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their potential for interaction with the amygdala (AMG), which is known to play a crucial role in the processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole-body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions: two sessions were preceded by stimulation of either right IPL (rIPL) or right PMv (rPMv); and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the left AMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than to neutral stimuli. In addition, the effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action-relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.</p>

Abstract
<p>The basomedial amygdala (BM) influences the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) through direct glutamatergic projections as well as indirectly, through the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). However, BM and BNSTa axons end in a segregated fashion in VMH. BM projects to the core of VMH, where VMH‚Äôs projection cells are located, whereas BNSTa projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa are unknown. To study this question, we recorded the responses of VMH‚Äôs shell and core neurons to the optogenetic activation of BM or BNSTa inputs in transgenic mice that selectively express Cre-recombinase in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic BM inputs fired most core neurons but elicited no response in GABAergic shell neurons. Following BM infusions of AAV-EF1Œ±-DIO-hChR2-mCherry in Vgat-ires-Cre-Ai6 mice, no anterograde labeling was observed in the VMH, suggesting that GABAergic BM neurons do not project to the VMH. In contrast, BNSTa sent mostly GABAergic projections that inhibited both shell and core neurons. However, BNSTa-evoked IPSPs had a higher amplitude in shell neurons. Since we also found that activation of GABAergic shell neurons causes an inhibition of core neurons, these results suggest that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, BNSTa inputs could elicit a net inhibition or disinhibition of core neurons. Thus, the dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa imparts flexibility to this regulator of defensive and social behaviors.</p>

Abstract
<p>GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest expression in the medial habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in dependent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.</p>

<p>Human neurons expressing mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease are becoming more widely available. Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live-cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length, and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live-cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.</p>

Abstract<p>Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, <i>Hirudo verbana</i>, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.</p>

How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.

In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‚Äòfree will‚Äô, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet‚Äôs original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.

Why did the axon cross the midline? A 1993 paper by Corey Goodman and colleagues described a genetic screen in fruit flies that pioneered the discovery of conserved families of axon guidance cues and receptors, highlighting fundamental processes underlying wiring specificity in the developing nervous system.

The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) in <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I‚ÄìIV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.</span>

Distinct firing properties among touch receptors are influenced by multiple, interworking anatomical structures. Our understanding of the functions and crosstalk of Merkel cells and their associated neurites‚Äîthe end organs of slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents‚Äîremains incomplete. Piezo2 mechanically activated channels are required both in Merkel cells and in sensory neurons for canonical SAI responses in rodents; however, a central unanswered question is how rapidly inactivating currents give rise to sustained action potential volleys in SAI afferents. The computational model herein synthesizes mechanotransduction currents originating from Merkel cells and neurites, in context of skin mechanics and neural dynamics. Its goal is to mimic distinct spike firing patterns from wildtype animals, as well as <i>Atoh1</i> knockout animals that completely lack Merkel cells. The developed generator function includes a Merkel cell mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents and downstream voltage-activated conductances (slower decay of current) and a neurite mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents (faster decay of current). To mimic sustained firing in wildtype animals, a longer time constant was needed than the 200 ms observed for mechanically activated membrane depolarizations in rodent Merkel cells. One mechanism that suffices is to introduce an ultra-slowly inactivating current, with a time constant on the order of 1.7 s. This mechanism may drive the slow adaptation of the sustained response, for which the skin‚Äôs viscoelastic relaxation cannot account. Positioned within the sensory neuron, this source of current reconciles the physiology and anatomical characteristics of <i>Atoh1</i> knockout animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN0hi7HylwE" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel Munro, Dario Ghersi, Mona Singh</p>

A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)‚ÄîUterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma‚Äîtwo specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Kr√ºppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei87dOiwXCQ" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: December 2018</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53</p><p>Author(s): Martha W Bagnall, David Schoppik</p><div><p>Most animals orient their bodies with respect to gravity to facilitate locomotion and perception. The neural circuits responsible for these orienting movements have long served as a model to address fundamental questions in systems neuroscience. Though postural control is vital, we know little about development of either balance reflexes or the neural circuitry that produces them. Recent work in a genetically and optically accessible vertebrate, the larval zebrafish, has begun to reveal the mechanisms by which such vestibular behaviors and circuits come to function. Here we highlight recent work that leverages the particular advantages of the larval zebrafish to illuminate mechanisms of postural development, the role of sensation for balance circuit development, and the organization of developing vestibular circuits. Further, we frame open questions regarding the developmental mechanisms for functional circuit assembly and maturation where studying the zebrafish vestibular system is likely to open new frontiers.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The sympathetic system‚Äôs role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase‚Äìamplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD<sub>pulse</sub>) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD<sub>pulse</sub> mapping revealed an ‚Äúautonomic brain network,‚Äù including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.</span>

A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing ‚Äì the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions ‚Äì to have real causal power in decision-making.

Bhattacharya et¬†al. show that the NMDA receptor GluN2C subunit is preferentially incorporated into triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors in cerebellar granule cells. Triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors have single-channel properties that cannot be predicted from the composite subunits.

Koranda et¬†al. demonstrate Mettl14 is indispensable for m6A mRNA methylation in the adult mammalian brain. Striatal Mettl14 deficiency decreases m6A tagging, altering the epitranscriptome profile. Mettl14 deficiency impairs behavior and alters intrinsic neuronal firing in the absence of morphological changes.

<p>by Giri P. Krishnan, Burke Q. Rosen, Jen-Yung Chen, Lyle Muller, Terrence J. Sejnowski, Sydney S. Cash, Eric Halgren, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6XKqTbGe3g" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/6011?rss=1">h-Type Membrane Current Shapes the Local Field Potential from Populations of Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

<p>In cortex, the local field potential (LFP) is thought to mainly stem from correlated synaptic input to populations of geometrically aligned neurons. Computer models of single cortical pyramidal neurons showed that subthreshold voltage-dependent membrane conductances can also shape the LFP signal, in particular the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>; h-type). This ion channel is prominent in various types of pyramidal neurons, typically showing an increasing density gradient along the apical dendrites. Here, we investigate how <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> affects the LFP generated by a model of a population of cortical pyramidal neurons. We find that the LFP from populations of neurons that receive uncorrelated synaptic input can be well predicted by the LFP from single neurons. In this case, when input impinges on the distal dendrites, where most h-type channels are located, a strong resonance in the LFP was measured near the soma, whereas the opposite configuration does not reveal an <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> contribution to the LFP. Introducing correlations in the synaptic inputs to the pyramidal cells strongly amplifies the LFP, while maintaining the differential effects of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> for distal dendritic versus perisomatic input. Previous theoretical work showed that input correlations do not amplify LFP power when neurons receive synaptic input uniformly across the cell. We find that this crucially depends on the membrane conductance distribution: the asymmetric distribution of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> results in a strong amplification of the LFP when synaptic inputs to the cell population are correlated. In conclusion, we find that the h-type current is particularly suited to shape the LFP signal in cortical populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular potentials recorded in neural tissue, is often used for probing neural circuit activity. While the cortical LFP is thought to mainly reflect synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons, little is known about the role of subthreshold active conductances in shaping the LFP. By means of biophysical modeling we obtain a comprehensive, qualitative understanding of how LFPs generated by populations of cortical pyramidal neurons depend on active subthreshold currents, and identify the key importance of the h-type channel. Our results show that LFPs can give information about the active properties of neurons and that preferred frequencies in the LFP can result from those cellular properties instead of, for example, network dynamics.</p>

<p>Vertebrate retinal development follows a pattern during which retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) give rise to all retinal cell types in a highly conserved temporal sequence. RPC proliferation and cell cycle exit are tightly coordinated to ensure proper and timely production of each of the retinal cell types. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in eye development, influencing RPC proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that laminins, key ECM components, in the inner limiting membrane, control mitotic spindle orientation by providing environmental cues to the RPCs. <i>In vivo</i> deletion of laminin Œ≤2 in mice of both sexes results in a loss RPC basal processes and contact with the ECM, leading to a shift of the mitotic spindle pole orientation toward asymmetric cell divisions. This leads to decreased proliferation and premature RPC pool depletion, resulting in overproduction of rod photoreceptors at the expense of bipolar cells and MuÃàller glia. Moreover, we show that deletion of laminin Œ≤2 leads to disruption and mislocalization of its receptors: dystroglycan and Œ≤1-integrin. Addition of exogenous Œ≤2-containing laminins to laminin Œ≤2-deficient retinal explants stabilizes the RPC basal processes and directs their mitotic spindle orientation toward symmetric divisions, leading to increased RPC proliferation, as well as restores proper receptor localization at the retinal surface. Finally, functional blocking of dystroglycan in wild-type retinal explants phenocopies laminin Œ≤2 ablation. Our data suggest that dystroglycan-mediated signaling between RPCs and the ECM is of key importance in controlling critical developmental events during retinogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mechanisms governing retinogenesis are subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling cues. Although the role of intrinsic signaling has been the subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of the microenvironment in retinal development remains unclear. Using a combination of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> approaches, we demonstrate that laminins, key extracellular matrix components, provide signaling cues that control retinal progenitor cell attachment to the basement membrane, mitotic axis, proliferation, and fate adoption. Moreover, we identify, for the first time, dystroglycan as the receptor responsible for directing retinal progenitor cell mitotic spindle orientation. Our data suggest a mechanism where dystroglycan-mediated signaling between the cell and the extracellular matrix controls the proliferative potential of progenitors in the developing CNS.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5982?rss=1">Local BDNF Delivery to the Injured Cervical Spinal Cord using an Engineered Hydrogel Enhances Diaphragmatic Respiratory Function</a></h4>

<p>We developed an innovative biomaterial-based approach to repair the critical neural circuitry that controls diaphragm activation by locally delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to injured cervical spinal cord. BDNF can be used to restore respiratory function via a number of potential repair mechanisms; however, widespread BDNF biodistribution resulting from delivery methods such as systemic injection or lumbar puncture can lead to inefficient drug delivery and adverse side effects. As a viable alternative, we developed a novel hydrogel-based system loaded with polysaccharide-BDNF particles self-assembled by electrostatic interactions that can be safely implanted in the intrathecal space for achieving local BDNF delivery with controlled dosing and duration. Implantation of BDNF hydrogel after C4/C5 contusion-type spinal cord injury (SCI) in female rats robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by <i>in vivo</i> recordings of compound muscle action potential and electromyography amplitudes. However, BDNF hydrogel did not decrease lesion size or degeneration of cervical motor neuron soma, suggesting that its therapeutic mechanism of action was not neuroprotection within spinal cord. Interestingly, BDNF hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by detailed neuromuscular junction morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from diaphragm using cholera toxin B. Furthermore, BDNF hydrogel enhanced the serotonergic axon innervation of PhMNs that plays an important role in modulating PhMN excitability. Our findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a robustly effective and safe strategy to restore diaphragm function after SCI. In addition, we demonstrate novel therapeutic mechanisms by which BDNF can repair respiratory neural circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Respiratory compromise is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We used an innovative biomaterial-based drug delivery system in the form of a hydrogel that can be safely injected into the intrathecal space for achieving local delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with controlled dosing and duration, while avoiding side effects associated with other delivery methods. In a clinically relevant rat model of cervical contusion-type SCI, BDNF hydrogel robustly and persistently improved diaphragmatic respiratory function by enhancing phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) innervation of the diaphragm neuromuscular junction and by increasing serotonergic innervation of PhMNs in ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. These exciting findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a safe and robustly effective strategy to maintain respiratory function after cervical SCI.</p>

How is odor information organized in the brain? In this issue of Neuron, Jeanne et¬†al. (2018) pair optogenetics with electrophysiology to map functional connections between two olfactory brain regions. They suggest that lateral horn neurons encode ‚Äúodor scenes‚Äù to represent biologically relevant odor environments.

Ultrafast endocytosis is a distinct form of synaptic vesicle recovery occurring within milliseconds of vesicle fusion. Using flash-and-freeze electron microscopy, Watanabe et¬†al. demonstrate dual roles for synaptojanin and endophilin in membrane remodeling and clathrin uncoating on rapid timescales during ultrafast endocytosis.

<p>by Fahad Alhasoun, Faisal Aleissa, May Alhazzani, Luis G. Moyano, Claudio Pinhanez, Marta C. Gonz√°lez</p>

This paper presents a data analysis framework to uncover relationships between health conditions, age and sex for a large population of patients. We study a massive heterogeneous sample of 1.7 million patients in Brazil, containing 47 million of health records with detailed medical conditions for visits to medical facilities for a period of 17 months. The findings suggest that medical conditions can be grouped into clusters that share very distinctive densities in the ages of the patients. For each cluster, we further present the ICD-10 chapters within it. Finally, we relate the findings to comorbidity networks, uncovering the relation of the discovered clusters of age densities to comorbidity networks literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5diqBMl6Y-k" width="1" />

In this review, we will cover our current knowledge about female behaviors in these two specific contexts. Recent studies elucidate on how females process the courtship song. They also show that egg-laying decisions are extremely complex, requiring the assessment of food, microbial, predator and social cues. Study of female responses will improve our understanding of how a nervous system processes different challenges.</p></div>

Their morphology and density change throughout life, reflecting the maturation and reorganization of excitatory circuits. The development of <em>in vivo</em> two-photon microscopy has enabled the monitoring of the same dendritic spines over time during different developmental periods. In this review we focus on recent <em>in vivo</em> imaging studies in rodents that have revealed cell type-specific and region-specific structural dynamics of dendritic spines. We also discuss how the contributions of local inhibitory neurons and long-distance excitatory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex influence dendritic spine development and dynamics. Such studies will facilitate our understanding of how environmental factors and experiences affect cortical synapse development.</p></div>

Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis, folding, quality control, and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network, and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response (UPR), the main mechanism that copes with ER stress, plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors, in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity, synapse formation, and neuronal plasticity.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals, biased by learning or reward, or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this ‚Äúwilled attention.‚Äù In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at ~500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal‚Äìparietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of synapses are available for different brain regions of several animal species including non-human primates, but comparatively little is known about their quantitative morphology in humans. Here, synaptic boutons in Layer 5 (L5) of the human temporal lobe (TL) neocortex were investigated in biopsy tissue, using fine-scale electron microscopy, and quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions. The size and organization of the presynaptic active zones (PreAZs), postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and that of the 3 distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were particularly analyzed. L5 synaptic boutons were medium-sized (~6 Œºm<sup>2</sup>) with a single but relatively large PreAZ (~0.3 Œºm<sup>2</sup>). They contained a total of ~1500 SVs/bouton, ~20 constituting the putative readily releasable pool (RRP), ~180 the recycling pool (RP), and the remainder, the resting pool. The PreAZs, PSDs, and vesicle pools are ~3-fold larger than those of CNS synapses in other species. Astrocytic processes reached the synaptic cleft and may regulate the glutamate concentration. Profound differences exist between synapses in human TL neocortex and those described in various species, particularly in the size and geometry of PreAZs and PSDs, the large RRP/RP, and the astrocytic ensheathment suggesting high synaptic efficacy, strength, and modulation of synaptic transmission at human synapses.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI, which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome, is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.</span>
