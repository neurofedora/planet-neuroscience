	<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) as well as noradrenaline (NA) are key modulators of various fundamental brain functions including the control of appetite. While manipulations that alter brain serotoninergic signaling clearly affect body weight, studies implicating 5-HT transporters and NA transporters (5-HTT and NAT, respectively) as a main drug treatment target for human obesity have not been conclusive. The aim of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to investigate how these central transporters are associated with changes of body weight after 6 months of dietary intervention or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in order to assess whether 5-HTT as well as NAT availability can predict weight loss and consequently treatment success. The study population consisted of two study cohorts using either the 5-HTT-selective radiotracer [11C]DASB to measure 5-HTT availability or the NAT-selective radiotracer [11C]MRB to assess NAT availability. Each group included non-obesity healthy participants, patients with severe obesity (body mass index, BMI, &amp;amp;gt;35 kg/m2) following a conservative dietary program (diet) and patients undergoing RYGB surgery within a 6-month follow-up. Overall, changes in BMI were not associated with changes of both 5-HTT and NAT availability, while 5-HTT availability in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) prior to intervention was associated with substantial BMI reduction after RYGB surgery and inversely related with modest BMI reduction after diet. Taken together, the data of our study indicate that 5-HTT and NAT are involved in the pathomechanism of obesity and have the potential to serve as predictors of treatment outcomes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are macrophage-like cells exerting determinant roles in neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress processes during brain regeneration. We used zebrafish as a model of brain plasticity and repair. First, by performing L-plastin (Lcp1) immunohistochemistry and using transgenic Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:GFP</i>) or Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:mCherry</i>) fish, we analyzed the distribution of microglia/immune cells in the whole brain. Specific regional differences were evidenced in terms of microglia/immune cell density and morphology (elongated, branched, highly branched, and amoeboid). Taking advantage of Tg(<i>fli:GFP</i>) and Tg(<i>GFAP::GFP)</i> enabling the detection of endothelial cells and neural stem cells (NSCs), we highlighted the association of elongated microglia/immune cells with blood vessels and rounded/amoeboid microglia with NSCs. Second, after telencephalic injury, we showed that L-plastin cells were still abundantly present at 5 days post-lesion (dpl) and were associated with regenerative neurogenesis. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis from injured telencephalon (5 dpl) confirmed the upregulation of microglia/immune cell markers and highlighted a significant increase of genes involved in oxidative stress <i>(nox2</i>, <i>nrf2a</i>, and <i>gsr)</i>. The analysis of antioxidant activities at 5 dpl also revealed an upregulation of superoxide dismutase and persistent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in the injured telencephalon. Also, microglia/immune cells were shown to be a source of oxidative stress at 5 dpl. Overall, our data provide a better characterization of microglia/immune cell distribution in the healthy zebrafish brain, highlighting some evolutionarily conserved features with mammals. They also emphasize that 5 days after injury, microglia/immune cells are still activated and are associated to a persistent redox imbalance. Together, these data raise the question of the role of oxidative stress in regenerative neurogenesis in zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro evaluation of ruminal digestibility and fermentation characteristics of local feedstuff-based beef cattle ration [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:¬†Consumption of local feedstuff¬†Neptunia plena¬†L. Benth and¬†Leersia hexandra¬†Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), ammonia (NH3)¬†production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle.¬†Methods:¬†Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents.¬†There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle, namely:¬†T1¬†(Leersia hexandra¬†Swartz 100 %); T2¬†(Neptunia plena L. Benth¬†100%); T3¬†(Leersia hexandra¬†Swartz¬†15% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth¬†15% + 70 % Other Feedstuffs); T4¬†(Leersia hexandra¬†Swartz¬†20% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth¬†20% + 60% Other Feedstuffs); T5¬†(Leersia hexandra¬†Swartz¬†25% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth¬†25% + 50% Other Feedstuffs).¬†In vitro¬†approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD,¬†NH3¬†production, and VFA in beef cattle. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test.¬†Results:¬†The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T¬†5¬†(56.47%), followed by T¬†4¬†(56.45%) and T¬†3¬†(55.90%). T¬†5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T¬†4=61.95% and T¬†3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest¬†NH¬†3¬†value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T¬†3=4.55 mM, T¬†4=4.50 mM, T¬†2=4.22 mM, and T¬†1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5¬†had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T¬†4, T¬†3, T¬†2, and T¬†1¬†with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively.¬†Conclusions:¬†The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indigenous astronomical knowledge based seasonal weather forecast: evidence from Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Indigenous knowledge is still widely used by communities around the world to overcome social-ecological challenges. Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia have been searching for future weather phenomena using their indigenous knowledge. This study examines indigenous knowledge-based seasonal weather forecasts through using observable physical and temporal patterns of astronomic objects. Data were generated through using focus group discussion, experimental knowledgeable groups and direct observation in the year 2021. The finding reveals that Borana Oromo pastoralists commonly define physical and temporal outlooks of the Moon that are changed and/ or displayed periodically within a range of varying contexts. The observation of the Moon features have been offering sufficient lapse time in a more than/within ahead of a season/ and is relatively more accurate than the other traditional forecasting objects. The study showed that both temporal and spatial dimensions of the forecasting were actually happened in Ganna (March to May rainfall), Adolessa dry season (June to September) and Hgayya rainfall (October to November) seasons of 2021. This indigenous weather forecasting practices are still regularly used in every livelihood decision making process. However, this indigenous weather knowledge of Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia is not yet mainstreamed in the formal institutional structures. Curtailments of mobility, severity of drought, weakening of traditional institution, leaving of traditional life style and death of the knowledgeable elders are the major factors that are challenging the potential effects of the indigenous weather forecasting indicators of the features of moon in the study area.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors affecting the family development index in Indonesia: a cross-sectional survey in Aceh, a region with a 30 year armed conflict experience [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Family development index needs to be measured to ensure that the government has made optimal efforts to provide happiness to the families and to develop strategies in family development in a region with unique conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the family development index and its associated determinants in Aceh province, a region implementing Syariah Law in Indonesia with 30 years of armed conflict experience. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all regencies in Aceh. The study was a part of the Indonesian National Population and Family Planning Board project. The survey included one individual from each household that was selected randomly. Family development index was measured using a questionnaire consisting of 15 questions. The plausible determinants were collected and assessed through a face-to-face interview. The family development index was dichotomized using 85% cut-off into good and poor. A two-step logistic regression was used to determine the associated determinants. Results: A total of 10,000 households were included in the final analysis. 86.6% had a good family development index, with the highest in Sabang (97.6%) and the lowest index in Aceh Singkil (76.6%), respectively. A multivariate analysis indicated that the regency, marital status, educational qualification, ownership of health insurance, ownership of childbirth certificate, quality of the house (the type of floor, the source of electricity, the source of drinking water and the type of toilet facility) were associated with the family development index. Conclusion: Despite Aceh being one of the less developed provinces in Indonesia with long armed conflict experience, our data suggest that the family development index is relatively high and the index is influenced both by economic and non-economic determinants. To further improve the family development index, it is critical to develop both economic and non-economic components in the region and in the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlation of cervical progesterone levels to plasma progesterone levels in normal pregnancy and preterm labor: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The theory of ‚Äúfunctional progesterone withdrawal‚Äù explains the role of progesterone prior to delivery. Previous studies mentioned the existence of progesterone regulation in the cervix that plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the cervix and cervical ripening. Cervical progesterone levels relate to activities of progesterone at the cervix, compared to its amount in circulation. The objective of this study was to measure cervical mucus progesterone levels and its correlation to plasma progesterone levels in pregnancy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in January-September 2010 at Persahabatan Hospital. The subjects were pregnant women in the 28th ‚Äì 34th weeks of gestational age. In total, 72 subjects who met the criteria were divided into normal pregnancy group and preterm labor group. The cervical and plasma progesterone levels were measured using The Advia Centaur¬Æ Progesterone kit, which is a commercial immunoassay with direct chemiluminescence method. Results: There was a positive correlation (r=0.539) between cervical progesterone levels with plasma progesterone levels in the preterm labor group. There was no correlation between cervical progesterone levels with plasma progesterone levels in the normal pregnancy group. Conclusion: ¬†This study showed that cervical progesterone levels could be measured through cervical mucus. A significant positive correlation was found by this study between cervical progesterone levels and plasma progesterone levels in the preterm labor group. ¬†This study is expected to provide new insights for understanding the metabolism and the role of progesterone in maintaining cervical integrity during pregnancy, and its relation to prevention of preterm birth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paediatric critical COVID-19: clinical features and outcomes during five waves. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data reported from several countries show that both children and adolescents accounted for less than 2% of symptomatic cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study objective was to describe the clinical characteristics of children admitted to Tunisian paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Methods: This was a single centre observational retrospective study conducted in the PICU of the Farhat Hached tertiary teaching hospital in Sousse, Tunisia during the period from the March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. We included all children aged from one month to 15 years with recent severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Infection was confirmed by the positivity of reverse transcriptase either for SARS-CoV2 or with presence of IgM antibodies. We included severe and critical forms of COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Results: 26 patients were included. 16 (61%) were one year old or younger. 18 patients (69.2%) were male. The median age in our research series was six months [1-156 months]. 17 (65.3%) patients had morbidities including mainly cardiac and neurological diseases. Fever (88.4%) and tachypnea (80.8%) were the most common clinical signs. Leukocytosis, high level of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, troponin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels were found in 17, 8, 10, 6, and 10 cases respectively. Seven patients were initially treated with high-flow nasal cannula and didn't need escalation. Three were intubated. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in six cases. Antibiotics and corticosteroids were used in 84% and 42.3% of children. The median paediatric intensive care unit length-of-stay was 10.9 days. There were six deaths. Conclusion: Paediatricians should be vigilant to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children admitted in PICU. Special attention should be allocated to infants under one year of age, of the male gender, and for children with comorbidities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Laboratory risk factors for mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several studies have reported clinical characteristics and risk factors for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19.4‚Äì6 However, data exclusively from the ICU especially in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) remain lacking. This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with mortality based on laboratory parameters at hospital admission in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study. Data from the electronic medical records were collected retrospectively from all severe and critical COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission in two designated COVID-19 hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors associated with ICU mortality. The model performance was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: There were 334 patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 included in the statistical analysis. The ICU mortality rate was 75.1%, with 251 patients died in the hospital. Independent risk factors associated mortality including white blood cell count >13.9 x109/L (OR=2.41; 95% CI, 1.15-5.06, p=0.02), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio >10.7 (OR=2.20; 95% CI, 1.20 ‚Äì 4.03, p=0.011), and creatinine >0.8 mg/dL (OR=3.55; 95% CI, 2.05 ‚Äì 6.17, p<0.001). The model yielded an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.659-0.780, p<0.0001) for predicting ICU mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: White blood cell, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and serum creatinine on hospital admission are significant predictors of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. The ICU mortality rate during the second wave of the pandemic in this study was high.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer in health care quality improvements. A second systematic review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, EB-CPGs have been believed to mainly improve the quality and consistency of health care, but this claim must be conclusively proven. We used the Donabedian three-dimensional model (structure, process, and patient outcomes) to assess improvements in the quality of medical care derived from implementing EB-CPGs. This study corresponds to the second systematic review carried out as a series of studies on different clinical issues that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the EB-CPG for improving the quality of care. Methods: We followed the methods described by the Cochrane Handbook and presented a descriptive analysis because of the high heterogeneity found across the included studies. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EBSCO Host databases, as well as the grey literature, between 1990 and April 2021. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were selected. Results: Of the total of 364 interventions included in the eleven RCTs evaluated, 11 (3%) were related to healthcare structure, 51 (14%) to the healthcare delivery process and 302 (83%) to patient outcomes. Regarding the impact of using the EB-CPGs, in 303 interventions (83%), there were no significant differences between the control and experimental groups. In 4 interventions (1%), the result favoured the control and intervention groups in 57 of the interventions (16%). Conclusions: Our study showed that EB-CPGs slightly enhanced the quality of health care in the three dimensions described by Donabedian. Future RCTs should improve their design and methodological rigour by considering the certainty of the evidence supporting the EB-CPGs recommendations. In that context, broader analyses could be performed, having more concise hypotheses for further research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020205594

                Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort comparative study of survival rates among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients was carried out between September 1, 2019, and June 30, 2021. A total of 404 patients were in the standard palliative care pain management treatment group (ST), and 87 were in the medicinal cannabis treatment group (CT). Patients with CCA were recruited from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. The cumulative survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were investigated using Cox regression. Results: For ST patients, there was a total follow-up time of 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients the total follow-up time was 476 person-months, with mortality rate of 10.9/ 100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71‚Äì0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94‚Äì9.38) for CT.¬†Multivariate analysis showed that CT treatment protocol was associated with a significantly better survival (P value <0.001; median time of CT, 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94‚Äì9.38); median time of ST, 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71‚Äì0.95). Therefore, CT had a reduced probability of dying from the disease (HRadj., 0.28 (95% CI: 0.20‚Äì0.37) Conclusions: The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Melan-A expression related to apoptosis of melanocytes in segmental and non-segmental vitiligo [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Vitiligo is a progressive depigmentation of the skin with unclear etiology. Cell-mediated immunity has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo‚Äôs progression. Melan-A has a high affinity for specific CD8+ T cells and is one of the critical markers for detecting damage to melanocytes. Our study aims to demonstrate the differences in Melan-A expression associated with apoptosis of melanocytes in patients with segmental vitiligo (SV) and those with non-segmental vitiligo (NSV). Methods A cross-sectional study with 64 patients diagnosed with vitiligo, of whom 33 had NSV and 31 had SV. Skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence were used to examine Melan-A, and the TUNEL staining method was performed to examine melanocyte apoptosis in both groups. Group comparisons were conducted using appropriate statistical methods. Results Melan-A expression was significantly higher in the NSV group than in the SV group, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.001). The median of melanocyte apoptosis in the NSV group was relatively higher than in the SV group, and a significant difference was found between the two groups (p=0.001). The Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation test between Melan-A expression and melanocyte apoptosis in the NSV group was 0.767 (76.7%) and showed a significant relationship (p<0.05). The same test in the SV group was 0.583 (58.3%) and showed a significant relationship (p<0.05). In both groups, the higher the Melan-A expression, the higher the melanocyte apoptosis. Conclusion Melan-A expression and melanocyte apoptosis are positively correlated. Higher Melan-A expression and melanocyte apoptosis in NSV indicates more severe vitiligo disease compared to SV.

                Background: Several studies have shown that active compounds of Asclepias subulata (cardenolides) have antiproliferative effect on human cancer cells. Cardenolides isolated from A. subulata can be used as active chemical markers to elaborate phytopharmaceutical preparations. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of a standardized extract of the aerial parts, based on Asclepias subulata cardenolides. Methods: Four standardized extracts were prepared by HPLC-DAD depending on the concentration of calotropin and the antiproliferative activity was measured for the MTT assay, on the A549, MCF-7, HeLa, PC3 and ARPE cell lines. The concentrations of calotropin used for the standardization of the extracts were 10, 7.6, 5 and 1 mg/dL. Results: Standardization of the A. subulata extract based on calotropin at 7.6 mg/g dry weight was achieved and the antiproliferative activity was evaluated over A549, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, obtaining proliferation percentages of 3.8 to 13.4%. Conclusions: The standardized extracts of A. subulata at different concentrations of calotropin showed antiproliferative activity against all the cell lines evaluated. The greatest effect was observed against the HeLa cell line.

                Japan is known for its exclusionary tendencies and clearly delineated Japanese way of doing things. Seeing as its immigration law was amended in April 2019 to allow more migrant workers into the country, there is some urgency in studying these ethnocentric practices, which often lead to inequalities between Japanese and foreign employees at the workplace. The objective of this opinion piece is to help the reader understand the sociocultural context and rationale behind Japanese norms in blue- and white-collar workplaces, as well as foreign employees‚Äô reactions and points of view. Such understanding will hopefully increase both Japanese and foreign employees‚Äô willingness to accommodate each other, and reduce friction and conflict at the workplace.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergent multilevel selection in a simple spatial model of the evolution of altruism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rutger Hermsen</p>

Theories on the evolutionary origins of altruistic behavior have a long history and have become a canonical part of the theory of evolution. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that allow altruism to appear and persist are still incompletely understood. It is well known, however, that the spatial structure of populations is an important determinant. In both theoretical and experimental studies, much attention has been devoted to populations that are subdivided into discrete groups. Such studies typically imposed the structure and dynamics of the groups by hand. Here, we instead present a simple individual-based model in which altruistic organisms spontaneously self-organize into spatially separated colonies that themselves reproduce by binary fission and hence behave as Darwinian entities in their own right. Using software to automatically track the rise and fall of colonies, we are able to apply formal theory on multilevel selection and thus quantify the within- and among-group dynamics. This reveals that individual colonies inevitably succumb to defectors in a within-colony ‚Äútragedy of the commons‚Äù. Even so, altruism persists in the population because more altruistic colonies reproduce more frequently and drive less altruistic ones to extinction. Evidently, the colonies promote the selection of altruism but in turn depend on altruism for their existence; the selection of altruism hence involves a kind of evolutionary bootstrapping. The emergence of the colonies also depends crucially on the length scales of motility, altruism, and competition. This reconfirms the general relevance of these scales for social evolution, but also stresses that their impact can only be understood fully in the light of the emergent eco-evolutionary spatial patterns. The results also suggest that emergent spatial population patterns can function as a starting point for transitions of individuality.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">cNap1 bridges centriole contact sites to maintain centrosome cohesion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robert Mahen</p>

Centrioles are non-membrane-bound organelles that participate in fundamental cellular processes through their ability to form physical contacts with other structures. During interphase, two mature centrioles can associate to form a single centrosome‚Äîa phenomenon known as centrosome cohesion. Centrosome cohesion is important for processes such as cell migration, and yet how it is maintained is unclear. Current models indicate that pericentriolar fibres termed rootlets, also known as the centrosome linker, entangle to maintain centriole proximity. Here, I uncover a centriole‚Äìcentriole contact site and mechanism of centrosome cohesion based on coalescence of the proximal centriole component cNap1. Using live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged cNap1, I show that proximal centrioles form dynamic contacts in response to physical force from the cytoskeleton. Expansion microscopy reveals that cNap1 bridges between these contact sites, physically linking proximal centrioles on the nanoscale. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)-calibrated imaging shows that cNap1 accumulates at nearly micromolar concentrations on proximal centrioles, corresponding to a few hundred protein copy numbers. When ectopically tethered to organelles such as lysosomes, cNap1 forms viscous and cohesive assemblies that promote organelle spatial proximity. These results suggest a mechanism of centrosome cohesion by cNap1 at the proximal centriole and illustrate how a non-membrane-bound organelle forms organelle contact sites.

                Background: In Japan, the effect of education using the leaflet ‚ÄòDiscipline Without Tough Love‚Äô on mothers during caring for their infants have been reported. We examined the effect of this education on pregnant Japanese women. Methods: The present study was a prospective investigation of all Japanese women with singleton pregnancies who visited our hospital for a perinatal visit at 20-23 weeks‚Äô gestation between November 2017 and March 2018 and gave birth at ‚â• 37 weeks‚Äô gestation at our hospital. We examined the maternal feelings (bonding situation) to babies of women who received the leaflet in comparison with that in women who did not receive it during the health check-up performed routinely at one month after delivery using the Japanese version of the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale. Results: There were no significant differences in maternal feelings for their babies between the two groups of women. Conclusions: We did not identify any effect of health consultations cased on ‚ÄòDiscipline Without Tough Love‚Äô during pregnancy on maternal feelings toward babies at one month after delivery. A further study to enlighten pregnant women about parenting without corporal punishment will be needed in Japan. Registration: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials 1030190112; registered on 5 October 2019.

                Li et¬†al. report that microglial NLRP3 inflammasome induces neurotoxic A1-like astrocytes and neuronal dysfunction in response to chronic mild stress in mice through pro-A1 astrocyte cytokines, involving upstream NF-Œ∫B pathway and downstream caspase-1 pathway. Their results suggest crucial roles of microglial NLRP3 in neurotoxic astrocyte reactivity in major depression.

                Scherm et¬†al. investigate how the Ebola virus spike glycoprotein (sGP) causes hyper-inflammation. They show that a hydrophobic peptide of sGP called the internal fusion loop (IFL) activates inflammatory signaling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The IFL binds directly to both TLR4 and co-receptor MD2, forming an active signaling complex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural defensive circuits underlie helping under threat in humans</a></h4>

              
                Empathy for others‚Äô distress has long been considered the driving force of helping. However, when deciding to help others in danger, one must consider not only their distress, but also the risk to oneself. Whereas the role of self-defense in helping has been overlooked in human research, studies in other animals indicate defensive responses are necessary for the protection of conspecifics. In this pre-registered study (N=49), we demonstrate that human defensive neural circuits are implicated in helping others under threat. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while deciding whether to help another participant avoid aversive electrical shocks, at the risk of also being shocked. We found that higher engagement of neural circuits that coordinate fast escape from self-directed danger (including the insula, PAG, and ACC) facilitated decisions to help others. Importantly, using representational similarity analysis, we found that the strength with which the amygdala and insula uniquely represented the threat to oneself (and not the other‚Äôs distress) predicted helping. Our findings indicate that in humans, as other mammals, defensive mechanisms play a greater role in helping behavior than previously understood.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oxytocin signaling in the posterior hypothalamus prevents hyperphagic obesity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Decades of studies have revealed molecular and neural circuit bases for body weight homeostasis. Neural hormone oxytocin (Oxt) has received attention in this context because it is produced by neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a known output center of hypothalamic regulation of appetite. Oxt has an anorexigenic effect, as shown in human studies, and can mediate satiety signals in rodents. However, the function of Oxt signaling in the physiological regulation of appetite has remained in question, because whole-body knockout (KO) of <i>Oxt</i> or <i>Oxt receptor</i> (<i>Oxtr</i>) has little effect on food intake. We herein show that acute conditional KO (cKO) of <i>Oxt</i> selectively in the adult PVH, but not in the supraoptic nucleus, markedly increases body weight and food intake, with an elevated level of plasma triglyceride and leptin. Intraperitoneal administration of Oxt rescues the hyperphagic phenotype of the PVH <i>Oxt</i> cKO model. Furthermore, we show that cKO of <i>Oxtr</i> selectively in the posterior hypothalamic regions, especially the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, a primary center for appetite regulations, phenocopies hyperphagic obesity. Collectively, these data reveal that Oxt signaling in the arcuate nucleus suppresses excessive food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Continuous sensing of IFNŒ± by hepatic endothelial cells shapes a vascular antimetastatic barrier</a></h4>

              
                Hepatic metastases are a poor prognostic factor of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and new strategies to reduce the risk of liver CRC colonization are highly needed. Herein, we used mouse models of hepatic metastatization to demonstrate that the continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of interferon-alpha (IFNŒ±) controls CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). Mechanistically, IFNŒ± promoted the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition, thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration, without requiring a direct action on tumor cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes, or liver dendritic cells (DCs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver capsular macrophages (LCMs). Moreover, IFNŒ± endowed LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential that, along with the early intravascular tumor burden reduction, supported the generation of antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and ultimately led to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNŒ± therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combining transgenesis with paratransgenesis to fight malaria</a></h4>

              
                Malaria is among the deadliest infectious diseases, and <i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent, needs to complete a complex development cycle in its vector mosquito for transmission to occur. Two promising strategies to curb transmission are transgenesis, consisting of genetically engineering mosquitoes to express antimalarial effector molecules, and paratransgenesis, consisting of introducing into the mosquito commensal bacteria engineered to express antimalarial effector molecules. Although both approaches restrict parasite development in the mosquito, it is not known how their effectiveness compares. Here we provide an in-depth assessment of transgenesis and paratransgenesis and evaluate the combination of the two approaches. Using the Q-system to drive gene expression, we engineered mosquitoes to produce and secrete two effectors ‚Äì scorpine and the MP2 peptide ‚Äì into the mosquito gut and salivary glands. We also engineered <i>Serratia</i>, a commensal bacterium capable of spreading through mosquito populations to secrete effectors into the mosquito gut. Whereas both mosquito-based and bacteria-based approaches strongly reduced the oocyst and sporozoite intensity, a substantially stronger reduction of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> development was achieved when transgenesis and paratransgenesis were combined. Most importantly, transmission of <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> from infected to na√Øve mice was maximally inhibited by the combination of the two approaches. Combining these two strategies promises to become a powerful approach to combat malaria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Normative decision rules in changing environments</a></h4>

              
                Models based on normative principles have played a major role in our understanding of how the brain forms decisions. However, these models have typically been derived for simple, stable conditions, and their relevance to decisions formed under more naturalistic, dynamic conditions is unclear. We previously derived a normative decision model in which evidence accumulation is adapted to fluctuations in the evidence-generating process that occur during a single decision (Glaze et al., 2015), but the evolution of commitment rules (e.g., thresholds on the accumulated evidence) under dynamic conditions is not fully understood. Here we derive a normative model for decisions based on changing contexts, which we define as changes in evidence quality or reward, over the course of a single decision. In these cases, performance (reward rate) is maximized using decision thresholds that respond to and even anticipate these changes, in contrast to the static thresholds used in many decision models. We show that these adaptive thresholds exhibit several distinct temporal motifs that depend on the specific predicted and experienced context changes and that adaptive models perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly (noisily). We further show that decision models with adaptive thresholds outperform those with constant or urgency-gated thresholds in accounting for human response times on a task with time-varying evidence quality and average reward. These results further link normative and neural decision-making while expanding our view of both as dynamic, adaptive processes that update and use expectations to govern both deliberation and commitment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Histone H3 clipping is a novel signature of human neutrophil extracellular traps</a></h4>

              
                Neutrophils are critical to host defence, executing diverse strategies to perform their antimicrobial and regulatory functions. One tactic is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In response to certain stimuli neutrophils decondense their lobulated nucleus and release chromatin into the extracellular space through a process called NETosis. However, NETosis, and the subsequent degradation of NETs, can become dysregulated. NETs are proposed to play a role in infectious as well as many non-infection related diseases including cancer, thrombosis, autoimmunity and neurological disease. Consequently, there is a need to develop specific tools for the study of these structures in disease contexts. In this study, we identified a NET-specific histone H3 cleavage event and harnessed this to develop a cleavage site-specific antibody for the detection of human NETs. By microscopy, this antibody distinguishes NETs from chromatin in purified and mixed cell samples. It also detects NETs in tissue sections. We propose this antibody as a new tool to detect and quantify NETs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive machine-learning survival framework develops a consensus model in large-scale multicenter cohorts for pancreatic cancer</a></h4>

              
                As the most aggressive tumor, the outcome of pancreatic cancer (PACA) has not improved observably over the last decade. Anatomy-based TNM staging does not exactly identify treatment-sensitive patients, and an ideal biomarker is urgently needed for precision medicine. Based on expression files of 1280 patients from 10 multicenter cohorts, we screened 32 consensus prognostic genes. Ten machine-learning algorithms were transformed into 76 combinations, of which we selected the optimal algorithm to construct an artificial intelligence-derived prognostic signature (AIDPS) according to the average C-index in the nine testing cohorts. The results of the training cohort, nine testing cohorts, Meta-Cohort, and three external validation cohorts (290 patients) consistently indicated that AIDPS could accurately predict the prognosis of PACA. After incorporating several vital clinicopathological features and 86 published signatures, AIDPS exhibited robust and dramatically superior predictive capability. Moreover, in other prevalent digestive system tumors, the nine-gene AIDPS could still accurately stratify the prognosis. Of note, our AIDPS had important clinical implications for PACA, and patients with low AIDPS owned a dismal prognosis, higher genomic alterations, and denser immune cell infiltrates as well as were more sensitive to immunotherapy. Meanwhile, the high AIDPS group possessed observably prolonged survival, and panobinostat may be a potential agent for patients with high AIDPS. Overall, our study provides an attractive tool to further guide the clinical management and individualized treatment of PACA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coding of latent variables in sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices during closed-loop virtual navigation</a></h4>

              
                We do not understand how neural nodes operate and coordinate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions. Here, we record single-unit spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to 'catch fireflies'. This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop virtual environment while concurrently computing continuous latent variables: (i) the distance and angle travelled (i.e., path integration) and (ii) the distance and angle to a memorized firefly location (i.e., a hidden spatial goal). We observed a patterned mixed selectivity, with the prefrontal cortex most prominently coding for latent variables, parietal cortex coding for sensorimotor variables, and MSTd most often coding for eye-movements. However, even the traditionally considered sensory area (i.e., MSTd) tracked latent variables, demonstrating path integration and vector-coding of hidden spatial goals. Further, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling (i.e., noise correlations) suggested a functional subnetwork composed by MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these and 7a, as anatomy would suggest. We show that the greater the unit-to-unit coupling between MSTd and dlPFC, the more the animals' gaze position was indicative of the ongoing location of the hidden spatial goal. We suggest this MSTd-dlPFC subnetwork reflects the monkeys' natural and adaptive task strategy wherein they continuously gaze toward the location of the (invisible) target. Together, these results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed action-perception loops and suggest that fine-grain functional subnetworks may be dynamically established to subserve (embodied) task strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional ultrasound imaging reveals an aberrant developmental trajectory of functional connectivity in a mouse model of the 15q13.3 copy number variant microdeletion</a></h4>

              
                The developmental nature of many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia necessitates the detection of functional biomarkers during the prodromal phase of disease that can predict symptomatic conversion and outcomes. Structural chromosomal aberrations, such as copy number variants, confer high risk and penetrance of neuropsychiatric disorders. We used functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) to characterize the functional connectivity profile of the 15q13.3+/- copy number variant mouse model during major developmental milestones on post-natal day (p)35, 42, 60, and 90 in comparison to wild type littermates. We identified divergent trajectories for 15q13.3+/- mice and WT littermate controls where functional connectivity was reduced for both genotypes with age, but to a lesser extent for 15q13.3+/- mice. We were then able to isolate the distinct differences between genotypes to identify a large-scale network where 15q13.3+/- mice displayed global cortical hyperconnectivity and elevated intra-connectivity within the hippocampus and amygdala, in particular. In order to determine the stage of development where the connectivity trajectories bifurcated, we used machine learning to predict genotype. We found that the connectivity profile from p42, but not p35, predicted the genotype of individual mice at p90 with 82% accuracy. All together, these results suggest a crucial period of network maturation from early to late pubescence that is pivotal in the transition of healthy network connectivity into adulthood. This novel application of fUS longitudinally through development shows promise in improving the understanding of the disease biology of mouse models of psychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal tissue maturation of thalamocortical pathways in the human fetal brain</a></h4>

              
                The development of connectivity between the thalamus and maturing cortex is a fundamental process in the second half of human gestation, establishing the neural circuits that are the basis for several important brain functions. In this study, we acquired high-resolution in utero diffusion MRI from 140 fetuses as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project, to examine the emergence of thalamocortical white matter over the second to third trimester. We delineate developing thalamocortical pathways and parcellate the fetal thalamus according to its cortical connectivity using diffusion tractography. We then quantify microstructural tissue components along the tracts in the fetal compartments that are critical substrates for white matter maturation, such as the subplate and intermediate zone. We identify patterns of change in the diffusion metrics that reflect critical neurobiological transitions occurring in the second to third trimester, such as the disassembly of radial glial scaffolding and the lamination of the cortical plate. These maturational trajectories of MR signal in transient fetal compartments provide a normative reference to complement histological knowledge, facilitating future studies to establish how developmental disruptions in these regions contribute to pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell analysis of prenatal and postnatal human cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical development involves birth, differentiation and maturation of a multitude of cellular lineages over the course of prenatal and postnatal life. Single-cell genomics provided insight into the molecular changes that underlie the development of early cortical lineages but has mostly been applied to the second trimester of prenatal human cortical development. Here, we utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing to capture the development of the main human cortical lineages across prenatal and postnatal stages until adulthood and generate a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human cortical development. We collected more than 350,000 single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles from 108 tissue samples from 60 donors representing the second and third trimester of gestation, as well as neonatal, early and late postnatal stages of development. We identify lineage-specific developmental programs that underlie the development of specific subtypes of excitatory cortical neurons, interneurons, glial cell types and brain vasculature. Moreover, we discover sex- and region-specific developmental changes in each of these lineages. By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for autism, we identify the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults that cause autism. We show that lineage-specific gene expression programs upregulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism. Since these genes are expressed at lower levels in males during development, they may be more susceptible to heterozygous loss of function in ASD, providing a basis for the increased male to female ratio of autism incidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cross-species proteomic map of synapse development reveals neoteny during human postsynaptic density maturation</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms and evolutionary changes accompanying synapse development are still poorly understood. Here, we generated a cross-species proteomic map of synapse development in the human, macaque, and mouse neocortex. By tracking the changes of >1,000 postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins from midgestation to adolescence, we found that PSD maturation in humans separates into three major phases that are dominated by distinct pathways. Cross-species comparisons reveal that the human PSD matures about three times slower than other species and contains higher levels of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) in the perinatal period. Enhancement of the RhoGEF signaling in human neurons delays the morphological maturation of dendritic spines and functional maturation of synapses, potentially contributing to the neotenic traits of human brain development. In addition, PSD proteins can be divided into four modules that exert stage- and cell type-specific functions, possibly explaining their differential associations with cognitive functions and diseases. Together, our proteomic map of synapse development provides a blueprint for studying the molecular basis and evolutionary changes of synapse maturation.

                The orientation of sketch maps of remote but familiar city squares produced from memory has been shown to depend on the distance and airline direction from the production site to the remembered square (position dependent recall, Rohrich et al. 2014). Here, we present a virtual reality version of the original experiment and additionaly study the role of body orientation. Three main points can be made: First, "immersive sketching" is a novel and useful paradigm in which subjects sketch maps live on paper while being immersed in virtual reality. Second, the original effect of position dependent recall was confirmed, indicating that the sense of presence generated in a virtual environment suffices to bias the imagery of distant places. Finally, the orientation of the produced sketch maps depended also on the body orientation of the subjects. At each production site, body orientation was controlled by varying the position of the life feed in the virtual environment such that subjects had to turn towards the prescribed direction. Position dependent recall is strongest if subjects are aligned with the airline direction to the target and virtually goes away if they turn in the opposite direction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Bayesian model for human directional localization of broadband and static sound sources</a></h4>

              
                Human listeners estimate the spatial direction of a sound source from multiple auditory features and prior information on the sound direction. In this work, we describe a model of directional localization of a broadband and stationary sound source presented in an anechoic environment to a static listener. The model is based on Bayesian inference and it infers the sound direction from the spatial percept built by weighting the sensory evidence with prior beliefs. With the imposed restrictions, the sensory evidence is composed by a simplistic extraction mechanisms for two binaural features evaluating interaural disparities in time and intensity with a more detailed extraction mechanisms of monaural spectral-shape features. Our analysis considered two model variants for monaural features: amplitude spectra and their spectral gradient profiles. In addition, the model accounts for two types of uncertainties: the sensory noise in spatial cues and the response noise of pointing towards the direction. The proposed model variants were fitted to individual performance of human listeners localizing noise bursts. We then tested the predictive power of those models on the effects of localizing with other ears and sounds with rippled spectrum. This evaluation, especially with the deviation from a flat source spectrum, showed a clear preference for the model variant with spectral gradient cues, also in comparison to previously proposed localization models. Hence, the proposed model provides a tool for the evaluation of head-related transfer functions and a solid basis for future extensions towards modeling dynamic listening conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semaphorin 4D induced inhibitory synaptogenesis restores benzodiazepine sensitivity in a mouse model of Status Epilepticus</a></h4>

              
                Previously we demonstrated that intra-hippocampal infusion of purified, Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) extracellular domain into the mouse hippocampus rapidly promotes formation of GABAergic synapses and decreases seizure susceptibility in mice. Given the relatively fast action of Sema4D treatment revealed by these studies, we sought to determine the time course of Sema4D treatment on hippocampal network activity using an acute hippocampal slice preparation. We performed long-term extracellular recordings from area CA1 encompassing a 2 hour application of Sema4D and found that hippocampal excitation is suppressed hours following treatment. We also asked if Sema4D treatment could ameliorate seizures in an acute seizure model: the kainic acid (KA) mouse model of Status Epilepticus (SE). We demonstrate that Sema4D treatment suppresses seizures and lessens benzodiazepine (BZD) insensitivity which is a hallmark of refractory SE. Lastly, we sought to explore alternative methods of Sema4D delivery to hippocampus and thus created an Adeno Associated Virus expressing the extracellular domain of Sema4D. Our data reveal that virally delivered, chronically overexpressed Sema4D extracellular domain promotes GABAergic synapse formation and suppresses seizure activity similar to the actions of purified Sema4D protein. These results provide proof of concept that Sema4D-mediated GABAergic synapse development could combat BZD insensitivity in intractable forms of epilepsy, and that viral delivery of Sema4D is an efficacious and promising delivery method.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social memory in female mice is rapidly modulated by 17Œ≤-estradiol through ERK and Akt modulation of synapse formation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social memory is essential to the functioning of a social animal within a group. Estrogens can affect social memory too quickly for classical genomic mechanisms. Previously, 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) rapidly facilitated short-term social memory and increased nascent synapse formation, these synapses being potentiated following neuronal activity. However, what mechanisms underlie and co-ordinate the rapid facilitation of social memory and synaptogenesis are unclear. Here, the necessity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling for rapid facilitation of short-term social memory and synaptogenesis was tested. Methods: Mice performed a short-term social memory task or were used as task-naive controls. ERK and PI3K pathway inhibitors were infused intra-dorsal hippocampally 5 minutes before E2 infusion. Forty minutes following intrahippocampal E2 or vehicle administration, tissues were collected for quantification of glutamatergic synapse number in the CA1. Results: Dorsal hippocampal E2 rapid facilitation of short-term social memory depended upon ERK and PI3K pathways. E2 increased glutamatergic synapse number (GluA1/bassoon colocalization) in task-performing mice but decreased synapse number in task-naive mice. Critically, ERK signaling was required for synapse formation/elimination in task-performing and task-naive mice, whereas PI3K inhibition blocked synapse formation only in task-performing mice. Conclusions: Whilst ERK and PI3K are both required for E2 facilitation of short-term social memory and synapse formation, only ERK is required for synapse elimination. This demonstrates previously unknown, bidirectional, rapid actions of E2 on brain and behaviour and underscores the importance of estrogen signaling in the brain to social behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representations of fricatives in sub-cortical model responses: comparisons with human perception</a></h4>

              
                Fricatives are obstruent phonemes made by constricting airflow in the vocal tract, producing turbulence across the constriction site or downstream from the constriction. Fricatives exhibit significant intra/inter-subject and contextual variability. Yet fricatives are perceived with high accuracy. The current study investigated modeled neural responses to fricatives in the auditory nerve (AN) and inferior colliculus (IC), with the hypothesis that response profiles across populations of neurons provide robust correlates to perception. Stimuli were 270 intervocalic fricatives (10 speakers x 9 fricatives x 3 utterances). Computational model response profiles had 50 characteristic frequencies, log-spaced from 125 to 8 or 20 kHz. Confusion matrices generated by KNN subspace classifiers used the average rates for the 50 characteristic frequencies as the features and compared them with published behavioral data. The modeled AN and IC neural responses provided better predictions of perceptual accuracy than the stimulus spectra, with IC showing better accuracy than AN. Perceptual fricative accuracy was explained by modeled neural response profiles, whereas confusions were only partially explained. Extended frequencies improved accuracy based on the model IC, corroborating the importance of extended high frequencies in speech perception. Future electrophysiological studies from IC cells and neural response simulations of hearing-impaired ears could guide the development of processing strategies.

                The amygdala is one of the most widely studied regions in behavioral neuroscience. A plethora of classical, and new paradigms have dissected its precise involvement in emotional and social sensing, learning, and memory. Several important insights resulted from the use of genetic markers - yet, in the age of single cell transcriptomics, the amygdala remains molecularly underdescribed. Here, we present a molecular cell type taxonomy of the full mouse amygdala in fear learning and consolidation. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on naive and fear conditioned mice, inferred the 130 neuronal cell types distributions in silico using orthogonal spatial transcriptomic datasets, and describe the cell types' transcriptional responses to learning and memory consolidation. Only a fraction of cells, within a subset of all neuronal types, were transcriptionally responsive to fear learning, memory and retrieval. These activated engram cells upregulated activity-response genes, and processes of synaptic signaling, plasticity, development and neurite outgrowth. Our transcriptome-wide data confirm known actors, and describe several new candidate genes. The atlas may help pinpoint the amygdala's circuits in performing emotional sensing and integration, and provide new insights to the global cellular processes involved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tackling the challenges of group network inference from intracranial EEG data</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial EEG (iEEG) data is a powerful way to map brain function, characterized by high temporal and spatial resolution, allowing the study of interactions among neuronal populations that orchestrate cognitive processing. However, the statistical inference and analysis of brain networks using iEEG data faces many challenges related to its sparse brain coverage, and its inhomogeneity across patients. We review these challenges and develop a methodological pipeline for estimation of network structure not obtainable from any single patient, illustrated on the inference of the interaction among visual streams using a dataset of 27 human iEEG recordings from a visual experiment employing visual scene stimuli. 100 ms sliding window and multiple band-pass filtered signals are used to provide temporal and spectral resolution. For the connectivity analysis we showcase two connectivity measures reflecting different types of interaction between regions of interest (ROI): Phase Locking Value as a symmetric measure of synchrony, and Directed Transfer Function - asymmetric measure describing causal interaction. For each two channels, initial uncorrected significance testing at p<0.05 for every time-frequency point is carried out by comparison of the data-derived connectivity to a baseline surrogate-based null distribution, providing a binary time-frequency connectivity map. For each ROI pair, a connectivity density map is obtained by averaging across all pairs of channels spanning them, effectively agglomerating data across relevant channels and subjects. Finally, the difference of the mean map value after and before the stimulation is compared to the same statistic in surrogate data to assess link significance. The analysis confirmed the function of the parieto-medial temporal pathway, mediating visuospatial information between dorsal and ventral visual streams during visual scene analysis. Moreover, we observed the anterior hippocampal connectivity with more posterior areas in the medial temporal lobe, and found the reciprocal information flow between early processing areas and medial place area. To summarize, we developed an approach for estimating network connectivity, dealing with the challenge of sparse individual coverage of intracranial EEG electrodes. Its application provided new insights into the interaction between the dorsal and ventral visual streams, one of the iconic dualities in human cognition.

                Motor neuron degeneration, the defining feature of ALS, is a primary example of cell-type specificity in neurodegenerative diseases. Using isogenic pairs of iPSCs harboring different familial ALS mutations, we assess the capacity of iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, sensory neurons, astrocytes, and superficial cortical neurons to capture disease features including transcriptional and splicing dysregulation observed in human post-mortem neurons. At surprisingly early time points, differentially regulated genes in iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, but not other cell types, overlap with one-third of the differentially regulated genes in laser-dissected motor neurons from postmortem spinal cords. The extent of dysregulation correlates well between iPSC-derived and bona fide spinal motor neurons. In iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, but not other derived cell types, we detect downregulation of genes affected by TDP-43-dependent aberrant splicing. This reduction takes place exclusively within genotypes known to involve TDP-43 pathology and occurs without evidence of TDP-43 mislocalization or protein level alteration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reading negative action verbs: one or two-step processing within the primary motor cortex?</a></h4>

              
                Controversy persists regarding the representation of negated actions, specifically concerning activation and inhibitory mechanisms in the motor system, and whether this occurs in one or two steps. We conducted two experiments probing corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the primary motor cortex at different latencies while reading affirmative and negative action sentences. Twenty-six participants read action and non-action sentences in affirmative or negative forms. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we probed CSE in hand muscles at rest and at several latencies after verb presentation. We observed a greater CSE for action sentences compared to non-action sentences, regardless of verb form. In experiment two, nineteen participants read affirmative and negative action sentences. We measured CSE and SICI at short and long latencies after verb presentation. CSE was greater for affirmative and negative action sentences at both latencies compared to rest. SICI did not change at the short latency but increased at longer latencies, regardless of verb form. Our results lend partial support for a two-step model, as negated actions showed the same motor excitability as affirmed actions with no additional inhibition at early latencies. Later neural differences between affirmative and negative actions may occur outside the primary motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesian Accounts of Perceptual Decisions in the Nonclinical Continuum of Psychosis: Greater Imprecision in Both Top-down and Bottom-up Processes</a></h4>

              
                Neurocomputational accounts of psychosis propose mechanisms for how information is integrated into a predictive model of the world, in attempts to understand the occurrence of altered perceptual experiences. Conflicting Bayesian theories postulate aberrations in either top-down or bottom-up processing. The top-down theory predicts an overreliance on prior beliefs or expectations resulting in aberrant perceptual experiences, whereas the bottom-up theory predicts an overreliance on current sensory information, as aberrant salience is directed towards objectively uninformative stimuli. This study empirically adjudicates between these models. We use a perceptual decision-making task in a neurotypical population with varying degrees of psychotic-like experiences. Bayesian modelling was used to compute individuals' reliance on prior relative to sensory information. Across two datasets (discovery dataset n=363; independent replication in validation dataset n=782) we showed that psychotic-like experiences were associated with an overweighting of sensory information relative to prior expectations, which seem to be driven by decreased precision afforded to prior information. However, when prior information was more uncertain, participants with greater psychotic-like experiences encoded sensory information with greater noise. Greater psychotic-like experiences were also associated with generally heightened perceptions of task instability, which we suggest may be the cause for the observed aberrant precision in the encoding both prior and likelihood information. Our study lends empirical support to notions of both weaker bottom-up and weaker (rather than stronger) top-down perceptual processes, as well as aberrancies in belief updating that extend into the non-clinical continuum of psychosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of consciously timed movements in shaping and improving auditory timing</a></h4>

              
                Our subjective sense of time is intertwined with a plethora of perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions, and likewise, the brain is equipped to expertly filter, weight, and combine these signals for seamless interactions with a dynamic world. Until relatively recently, the literature on time perception has excluded the influence of motor activity, yet, it has been found that motor circuits in the brain are at the core of most timing functions. Several studies have now identified that concurrent movements exert robust effects on perceptual timing estimates, but critically, have not assessed how humans consciously judge the duration of their own movements. This creates a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms driving movement-related effects on sensory timing. We sought to address this gap by administering a sensorimotor timing task in which we explicitly compared the timing of isolated auditory tones and arm movements, or both simultaneously. We contextualized our findings within a Bayesian cue combination framework, in which separate sources of temporal information are weighted by their reliability and integrated into a unitary time estimate that is more precise than either unisensory estimate. Our results revealed differences in accuracy between auditory, movement, and combined trials, and crucially, that combined trials were the most accurately timed. Under the Bayesian framework, we found that participants' combined estimates were more precise than isolated estimates in a way that trended towards optimality, while being overall less optimal than the model's prediction. These findings elucidate previously unknown qualities of conscious motor timing, and proposes computational mechanisms that can describe how movements combine with perceptual signals to create unified, multimodal experiences of time.

                Bees rely heavily on vision during most of their interaction with the environment, but so far, visual abilities have not been included into functional investigations of these crucial pollinators. This is probably due to the lack of comprehensive and phylogenetically-controlled quantification of visual traits across species. In the present study, we used high-throughput micro-CT tools to quantify, compare and understand the diversity of visual traits of compound eyes in bumblebees. Visual systems of bumblebees were far from identical, with variations across sizes, castes and species. While phylogenetic proximity poorly supported interspecific variations, these were better explained by two ecological factors: social parasitism and habitat. The eye parameter, a metric that measures the relative investment of a compound eye into resolution or sensitivity, was lower in queens of social parasitic species than of non-parasitic species. Workers of species associated with forested habitat had distinct visual traits, including a higher eye parameter, than those of species living in open landscapes. These diverse visual traits are likely to provide selective advantages to bumblebees given their specific ecological requirements. We thus propose that social parasitism and forest habitat are drivers of the diversification of compound eyes in bumblebees. Finally, we discuss how the present study can inspire trait-based approaches in ecology and conservation biology.

                Development of the nervous system depends on signaling centers, specialized cellular populations that produce secreted molecules to regulate neurogenesis in the neighboring neuroepithelium. Some signaling centers also generate key types of neurons. The formation of a signaling center involves its induction, the maintenance of expression of its secreted molecules, and cell differentiation and migration events. How these distinct processes are coordinated during signaling center development remains unknown. Here we show that Lmx1a acts as a master regulator to orchestrate the formation and function of the cortical hem (CH), a critical signaling center that controls hippocampus development. Lmx1a co-regulates CH induction, its Wnt signaling, and the differentiation and migration of CH-derived Cajal-Retzius neurons. Combining RNAseq, genetic, and rescue experiments, we identified major downstream genes that mediate distinct Lmx1a-dependent processes. Our work revealed that signaling centers in the mammalian brain employ master regulatory genes and established a framework for analyzing signaling center development.

                Mechanisms of specific memory deficits associated with Rett syndrome are poorly understood, at least in part because mutations of MECP2 have confounding effects on nervous system development and basal synaptic transmission. To mitigate such empirical uncertainties, this study exploited technical advantages of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse to examine the potential role of MeCP2 in long-term synaptic plasticity. The results indicate MeCP2 may act as an inhibitory constraint on gene expression required for formation as well as maintenance of plasticity.

                Synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease etc. are characteristic for -synuclein aggregates in neurons or glia, and are always manifested olfaction deficits at their primary onsets. It remains elusive why aggregated -synuclein predominantly affects olfactory system. Employing the knockout mice, we investigated the physiological function of -synuclein in olfactory system and found that SNCA/-synuclein deletion primarily interfered the projection of olfactory neurons. iTRAQ-based LC-MS identified 188 differentially expressed proteins, including 9 that were associated with axon guidance. Among them, NCK2 was most significantly down-regulated, which was indicated to be involved a PPI network of 21 proteins, including 11 players of the Ephrin receptor signaling pathway. Either SNCA/-synuclein deletion or NCK2 deficiency inactivated EphA4 receptor. Re-expressing -synuclein in the knockout neurons reverse the NCK2, as well as the phosphorylated EphA4. Thus, -synuclein regulated axon guidance through NCK2-EphA4 signaling pathway. Malfunction of -synuclein, whether because of deletion or aggregation, may cause aberrant olfactory neurons projection and subsequent olfaction deficits. This extended our knowledge of -synuclein in olfactory system, which may explain why olfaction is usually impaired in some synucleinopathies.

                Many neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, affect males more than females. Genomic mechanisms enhancing risk in males may contribute to this sex-bias. The ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene (Ube3a) exerts pleiotropic effects on cellular homeostasis via control of protein turnover and by acting as transcriptional coactivator with steroid hormone receptors. Overdosage of Ube3a via duplication or triplication of chromosomal region 15q11-13 causes 1-2% of autistic cases. Here, we test the hypothesis that increased dosage of Ube3a may influence autism-relevant phenotypes in a sex-biased manner. We report robust sex-biasing effects on brain connectomics and repetitive behaviors in mice with extra copies of Ube3a. These effects were associated with a profound transcriptional dysregulation of several known autism-associated genes (e.g., FMR1, SCN2A, PTEN, MEF2C, SHANK3, TSC2) as well as differentially-expressed genes identified in human 15q duplication and in autistic patients. Notably, increased Ube3a dosage also affects multiple sex-relevant mechanisms, including genes on the X chromosome, genes influenced by sex steroid hormones, downstream targets of the androgen and estrogen receptors, or genes that are sex-differentially regulated by transcription factors. These results suggest that Ube3a overdosage can critically contribute to sex-bias in neurodevelopmental conditions via influence on sex-differential mechanisms.

                Early-life experiences may promote stereotyped behavioral alterations that are dynamic across development time, but also behavioral responses that are variable among individuals, even when initially exposed to the same stimulus. Here, by utilizing longitudinal monitoring of C. elegans individuals throughout development we show that behavioral effects of early-life starvation are exposed during early and late developmental stages and buffered during intermediate stages of development. We further found that both dopamine and serotonin shape the discontinuous behavioral responses by opposite and temporally segregated functions across development time. While dopamine buffers behavioral responses during intermediate developmental stages, serotonin promotes behavioral sensitivity to stress during early and late stages. Interestingly, unsupervised analysis of individual biases across development uncovered multiple individuality types that coexist within stressed and unstressed populations and further identified experience-dependent effects on their composition. These results provide insight into the complex temporal regulation of behavioral plasticity across developmental timescales, structuring shared and unique individual responses to early-life experiences.

                Performance during instrumental learning is commonly believed to reflect the knowledge that has been acquired up to that point. However, recent work in rodents found that instrumental performance was enhanced during periods when reinforcement was withheld, relative to periods when reinforcement was provided. This suggests that reinforcement may mask acquired knowledge and lead to impaired performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such a beneficial effect of removing reinforcement translates to humans. Specifically, we tested whether performance during learning was improved during non-reinforced relative to reinforced task periods using signal detection theory and a computational modelling approach. To this end, 60 healthy volunteers performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement. To probe acquired knowledge in the absence of reinforcement, we interspersed blocks without feedback. In these non-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased d', indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. However, computational modelling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learnt values, but to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias. Together with an initial tendency to act, this is sufficient to drive differential changes in hit and false alarm rates that jointly lead to an increased d'. To conclude, the improved instrumental performance in the absence of reinforcement observed in studies using asymmetrically reinforced go/no-go tasks may reflect a change in response bias rather than unmasking latent knowledge.

                Loss of function (LoF) of Tar-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and mislocalization, together with TDP-43-positive and hyperphosphorylated inclusions, are found in postmortem tissue of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, including those carrying LoF variants in the progranulin gene (GRN). Modeling TDP-43 pathology has been challenging in vivo and in vitro. We present a 3D-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived paradigm - mature brain organoids (mbOrg) - composed of cortical-like-astrocytes (iA) and neurons (iN). When devoid of GRN, mbOrgs spontaneously recapitulate TDP-43 mislocalization, hyperphosphorylation and LoF phenotypes. Mixing-and-matching genotypes in mbOrgs showed that GRN-/- iA are drivers for TDP-43 pathology. Finally, we rescued TDP-43 LoF by adding exogenous progranulin, demonstrating a link between TDP-43 LoF and progranulin expression. In conclusion, we present an iPSC-derived platform that shows striking features of human TDP-43 proteinopathy and provides a tool for mechanistic modeling of TDP-43 pathology and patient-tailored therapeutic screening for FTD and ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A common neural code for representing imagined and inferred tastes</a></h4>

              
                Inferences about the taste of foods are a key aspect of our everyday experience of food choice. Despite this, gustatory mental imagery is a relatively under-studied aspect of our mental lives. In the present study, we examined subjects during high-field fMRI as they actively imagined basic tastes and subsequently viewed pictures of foods dominant in those specific taste qualities. Imagined tastes elicited activity in the bilateral dorsal mid-insula, one of the primary cortical regions responsive to the experience of taste. In addition, within this region we reliably decoded imagined tastes according to their dominant quality (sweet, sour, or salty) thus indicating that, like actual taste, imagined taste activates distinct quality-specific neural patterns. Using a cross-task decoding analysis, we found that the neural patterns for imagined tastes and food pictures in the mid-insula were reliably similar and quality-specific, suggesting a common code for representing taste quality regardless of whether explicitly imagined or automatically inferred when viewing food. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of mental imagery and the multimodal nature of presumably primary sensory brain regions like the dorsal mid-insula.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localized APP pathology in the hippocampus is sufficient to result in progressive disorganization of the timing of neuronal firing patterns</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in spatial navigation are among the early symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients, consistent with the hippocampal formation as the site for spatial computations and disease onset. Although the correspondence between the early symptoms and brain regions that are affected early in the disease has been recognized, it is not clear whether progressive cognitive decline is solely caused by a spreading pathology or whether a focal pathology can by itself cause aberrant neuronal activity in a larger network. These possibilities cannot be distinguished in standard disease models which broadly express APP across brain regions. We therefore generated a mouse model in which the expression of mutant human APP was limited to hippocampal CA3 cells (CA3-APP mice). We first asked whether the limited pathology in CA3 can result in memory deficits and found impaired performance of CA3-APP mice in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. By then recording in the CA1 region, we asked to what extent neuronal activity patterns emerged in a brain region which received projections from APP-expressing CA3 cells, but did itself not show any primary pathology. While the spatial firing patterns of CA1 cells were preserved, we observed a reduced theta oscillation frequency in the local field potential and in a subpopulation of principal cells in CA1. Furthermore, CA1 interneurons showed decreased theta oscillation frequencies, and this effect was even more pronounced in CA3 interneurons, which also do not directly express APP. Pathology that is highly localized and limited to presynaptic cells is thus sufficient to cause aberrant firing patterns in postsynaptic neuronal networks, which indicates that disease progression is not only from a spreading molecular pathology but also mediated by progressive physiological dysfunction.

                Physical exercise has been positioned as a promising strategy to prevent and/or alleviate anxiety and depression, but the mechanisms underlying its effects on mental health have yet to be entirely determined. Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on body weight, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, as well as different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, Splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise limited weight gains, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, mediated by the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis.

                Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is a site of convergence between pyramidal neuron dendrites and feedback axons where local inhibitory signaling can profoundly shape cortical processing. Evolutionary expansion of human neocortex is marked by distinctive pyramidal neuron types with extensive branching in L1, but whether L1 interneurons are similarly diverse is underexplored. Using patch-seq recordings from human neurosurgically resected tissues, we identified four transcriptomically defined subclasses, unique subtypes within those subclasses and additional types with no mouse L1 homologue. Compared with mouse, human subclasses were more strongly distinct from each other across all modalities. Accompanied by higher neuron density and more variable cell sizes compared with mouse, these findings suggest L1 is an evolutionary hotspot, reflecting the increasing demands of regulating the expanding human neocortical circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptography: unveiling visual perceptual hallucinations induced by optogenetic stimulation of the inferior temporal cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Artificial perturbation of local neural activity in the high-level visual cortex alters visual perception. Quantitative characterization of these perceptual alterations holds the key to the development of a mechanistic theory of visual perception. Historically, though, the complexity of these perceptual alterations, as well as their subjective nature, has rendered them difficult to quantify. Here, we trained macaque monkeys to detect and report brief optogenetic impulses delivered to their inferior temporal cortex, the high-level visual area associated with object recognition, via an implanted LED array. We assumed that the animals perform this task by detecting the stimulation-induced alterations of the contents of their vision. We required the animals to fixate on a set of images during the task and utilized a machine-learning structure aiming at physically perturbing the viewed images in order to trick the animals into thinking they were being stimulated. In a high-throughput iterative process of behavioral data collection, we developed highly specific perturbed images, perceptograms, looking at which would trick the animals into feeling cortically stimulated. Perceptograms provide parametric and pictorial evidence of the visual hallucinations induced by cortical stimulation. Objective characterization of stimulation-induced perceptual events, besides its theoretical value, opens the door to making better visual prosthetic devices as well as a deeper understanding of visual hallucinations in mental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Robust, Compact and Diverse Population Code for Competing Sounds in Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits encoding sensory information consist of populations of neurons, yet how information aggregates via pooling individual cells remains poorly understood. Such pooling may be particularly important in noisy settings where single neuron encoding is degraded. One example is the cocktail party problem, with competing sounds from multiple spatial locations. How populations of neurons in auditory cortex (ACx) code competing sounds have not been previously investigated. Here, we apply a novel information theoretic approach to estimate information in populations of neurons in ACx about competing sounds from multiple spatial locations, including both summed population (SP) and labeled line (LL) codes. We find that a small subset of neurons is sufficient to nearly maximize mutual information over different spatial configurations, with the LL code outperforming the SP code, and approaching information levels attained without noise. Moreover, with a LL code, units with diverse spatial responses, including both regular and narrow-spiking units, constitute the best pool. Finally, information in the population increases with spatial separation between target and masker, in correspondence with behavioral results on spatial release from masking in human and animals. Taken together, our results reveal that a compact and diverse population of neurons in ACx provide a robust code for competing sounds from different spatial locations.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized mainly by deficits in social communication and stereotyped and restricted interests. Deficits in social interactions in ASD animal models are generally analysed using the three chambers test paradigm that is simple to implement and use but fails to detect subtle social deficits or complex social behavior on an extended period of time within a group of mice. Here, we set up a novel procedure entitled the Live Mouse Tracker (LMT) that detects a great number of complex social behaviours that we recorded continuously for up to three days in groups of 4 mice. This was performed in the valproic acid (VPA) mouse model where VPA (450 mg/kg) was injected to pregnant females at E12.5. Studies were performed with a special focus on females given that ASD is 3-4 times more diagnosed in males than in females and that several ASD models failed to detect major social deficits in females, contrary to males. Comparisons were made within groups of 4 female animals with same treatment or within groups of different treatments (saline versus VPA). We report that VPA females show several types of social deficits and that are different in nature and magnitude in relation with time (from 1 hour to 3 days). These deficits were also different when VPA mice were tested together compared to when they were mixed with saline treated mice. Indeed, while social behavior was improved in VPA mice with the presence of saline mice while that of saline mice was negatively affected by the presence of VPA mice. This study indicates that female VPA mice show several social deficits, contrary to the common knowledge. It further implies that ASD related behavior alters normal behavior in a mixed group of mice.

                The superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) are highly visual and receive direct input from the retina. Nonetheless, neural activity in the superficial SC (sSC) is modulated by locomotion and pupil-linked arousal. Here we show that visual responses of neurons in the sSC are additionally modulated by reward delivered prior to the visual stimulus. We trained mice to perform a visual detection task and recorded the activity of neurons in the SC using two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings using high-density silicone probes (Neuropixels). Neurons across all layers of the SC responded to various task events, including reward delivery. However, responses to events like licking or movements did not explain the visual response modulation by reward. Electrophysiological recordings showed that most of the reward modulation occurred in the superficial rather than the deeper layers of the SC. Neurons also exhibited modulation by pupil-linked arousal, which was independent of the reward modulation. Performance of a population decoder to detect visual stimuli improved significantly by reward modulation but not by pupil-linked arousal modulation. Our results indicate that behavioural factors other than locomotion and arousal modulate visual activity in the SC.

                We are unresponsive during slow-wave sleep but continue monitoring external events for survival. Our brain wakens us when danger is imminent. If events are non-threatening, our brain might store them for later consideration to improve decision-making. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether simultaneously sleep-played foreign words and translation words are encoded/stored and which neural-electrical events facilitate encoding/storage. A closed-loop algorithm targeted word pairs to slow-wave peaks or troughs. Retrieval tests were given 12 and 36 hours later. These tests required decisions regarding the semantic category of previously sleep-played foreign words. The sleep-played vocabulary influenced awake decision-making 36 hours later, if targeted to troughs. The words' linguistic processing raised neural complexity. The words' semantic-associative encoding was supported by increased theta power during the ensuing peak. Fast-spindle power ramped up during a second peak likely aiding consolidation. Hence, new vocabulary played during slow-wave sleep was stored and influenced decision-making days later.

                Theoretical accounts disagree on the role of dopamine in intertemporal choice and assume that dopamine either promotes delay of gratification by increasing the preference for larger rewards or that dopamine reduces patience by enhancing the sensitivity to waiting costs. Here, we reconcile these conflicting accounts by providing empirical support for a novel process model according to which dopamine contributes to two dissociable components of the decision process, evidence accumulation and starting bias. We re-analyzed a previously published data set where intertemporal decisions were made either under the D2 antagonist amisulpride or under placebo by fitting a hierarchical drift diffusion model that distinguishes between dopaminergic effects on the speed of evidence accumulation and the starting point of the accumulation process. Blocking dopaminergic neurotransmission not only strengthened the sensitivity to whether a reward is perceived as worth the delay costs during evidence accumulation (drift rate) but also attenuated the impact of waiting costs on the starting point of the evidence accumulation process (bias). Taken together, our findings support a novel, process-based account of the role of dopamine for cost-benefit decision making, highlight the potential benefits of process-informed analyses and advance our understanding of dopaminergic contributions to decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic Modulation Shifts the Response of CA1 Pyramidal Cells to Depolarizing Ramps via TRPM4 Channels with Implications for Place Field Firing</a></h4>

              
                A synergistic combination of in vitro electrophysiology and multicompartmental modeling of rat CA1 pyramidal neurons identified TRPM4 channels as major drivers of cholinergic modulation of the firing rate during a triangular current ramp, which emulates the elevation in synaptic input received while traversing the place field. In control, fewer spikes at lower frequencies are elicited on the down-ramp compared to the up-ramp. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) reverses this spike rate adaptation, causing more spikes to be elicited on the down-ramp than the up-ramp. The non-specific TRP antagonist flufenamic acid and the TRPM4-specific blockers CBA and 9-phenanthrol, but not the TRPC-specific antagonist SKF96365, reverse the effect of CCh; this implicates the Ca2+-activated nonspecific cation current, ICAN, carried by TRPM4 channels. Modeling suggests that the IP3 receptor is the locus that requires both CCh and sustained depolarization to produce the rightward shift in firing rate along the ramp. In the model, a step change in IP3, representing the activation of muscarinic receptors by CCh, coupled with an increase in bulk [Ca2+] due to voltage-gated Ca2+ influx during the ramp, activates Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). CICR in turn activates TRPM4, via a nanodomain required by the presumed micromolar half-activation for TRPM4.

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly worse worldwide since it was discovered in China in late December 2019. Easy contact transmission between people and a low to moderate mortality rate may cause failure in medical health services if there is no proper personal protective equipment for personnel. During the pandemic, patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion who required immediate treatment through mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were still being sent to the emergency room. Knowing how to maintain effective treatment standards has become our concern. We used a retrospective, single-center study to select COVID-19 (-) patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy during the years 2020&amp;amp;ndash;2021. Patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion received mechanical thrombectomy were compared with patients admitted from December 2020 to May 2021 (the pre- COVID-19 group) and those from June 2021 to November 2021 (the during COVID-19 group). Furthermore, the time disparity of mechanical thrombectomy was compared between these two groups. Of patients confirmed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) during the study period, 62 were included. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (34 patients; median age, 70.5 years), the during COVID-19 group (28 patients; median age, 71.5 years) showed no major median time difference in door-to-computed-tomography-angiography (CTA) time (19.0 min vs. 20.0 min, p = 0.398) and no major median time difference in door-to-groin-puncture time (118.0 min vs. 109.0 min, p = 0.281). In our study, with a prepared protocol for the pandemic having been established in the healthcare system, we could see no difference between the pre-pandemic and during-pandemic time periods when using mechanical thrombectomy to treat COVID-19 (-) patients of AIS with LVO. By means of a quick-PCR test during triage, there was no time delay to perform MT or any lowering of safety protocol for workers in the healthcare system.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy and migraine are among the most prevalent neurological disorders. By being comorbid, the presence of one disorder increases the likelihood of the other. Although several similar clinical features of epilepsy and migraine have been observed as early as the 19th century, only in recent years have researchers engaged in finding a common pathogenic mechanism between them. In this study, the epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity rat model was generated, and the pathophysiological basis of epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity was examined. Male rats were divided into four groups: control, migraine, epilepsy, epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity. After establishing the models, the amount of scratching and the pain threshold of the rats were observed. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the protein expression levels of TLR4 and GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, trigeminal ganglion, and medullary dorsal horn. Subsequently, co-immunoprecipitation of GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 and TLR4 was performed. Then, the rats were divided into three groups: comorbidity, comorbidity + TAK-242, and comorbidity + muscimol. After drug intervention, the seizure latency, seizure level, amount of scratching, and pain threshold were observed. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of TLR4 and GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, trigeminal ganglion, and medullary dorsal horn. Our results demonstrate that the seizure attacks in comorbidity and epilepsy groups performed severely, and the comorbidity and migraine groups displayed a remarkable increase in the amount of head-scratching and a noticeable decrease in the facial mechanical withdrawal threshold. Further analysis revealed considerably increased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), associated with reduced &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid type A receptor &amp;amp;alpha;1 (GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1) and microglia enhanced in the epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity rat. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation proved GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 binding TLR4. Following muscimol to activate GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1, seizure attacks and migraine-like behavior were rescued. GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 level increment was accompanied by the decline of TLR4, while TAK-242, the inhibitor of TLR4, only decreased TLR4 without affecting GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 expression. It also ameliorated the migraine-like behavior with no impact on seizure activity. We propose that GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 binding and negatively regulating TLR4 contribute to epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity; TLR4 is a critical intermediate link in epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity; immune-induced neuroinflammation in microglia may be involved in migraine and epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity.</p>

	<p>Recently, astrocytes are fast climbing the ladder of importance in cognitive-related diseases. Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common consequence of anesthesia and surgery, which is widely investigated in elderly and susceptible individuals. There is no doubt that astrocytes also play an irreplaceable role in the pathogenesis of PND. Reactive astrocytes can be found in the PND model, with an altered phenotype and morphology, suggesting a role in the development of the diseases. As a prominent participant cell in the central inflammatory response, the inflammatory response is unavoidably a crucial pathway in the development of the disease. Astrocytes also play a significant role in the homeostasis of the internal environment, neuronal metabolism, and synaptic homeostasis, all of which have an impact on cognitive function. In this article, we discuss the function of astrocytes in PND in order to establish a framework for investigating treatments for PND that target astrocytes.</p>

	<p>Background: Aggressive resection without compromising the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s neurological status remains a significant challenge in treating intracranial gliomas. Our current study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extra-operative stimulation and mapping via implanted subdural electrodes with or without depth (EOCSM), offering an alternative approach when awake mapping is contraindicated. Methods: Fifty-one patients undergoing EOCSM for glioma resection in our institution formed the sample study of our current retrospective study. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of our approach by measuring the extent of resection and recording the periprocedural complications, respectively. Results: The mean age of our participants was 58 years (&amp;amp;plusmn;9.4 years). The lesion was usually located on the left side (80.4%) and affected the frontal lobe (51.0%). EOCSM was successful in 94.1% of patients. The stimulation and electrode implantation procedures lasted for a median of 2.0 h and 75 h, respectively. Stimulation-induced seizures and CSF leakage occurred in 13.7% and 5.9% of our cases. The mean extent of resection was 91.6%, whereas transient dysphasia occurred in 21.6% and transient hemiparesis in 5.9% of our patients, respectively. Conclusions: Extraoperative stimulation and mapping constitute a valid alternative mapping option in glioma patients who cannot undergo an awake craniotomy.</p>

	<p>The present report from the field tries to present challenges associated with establishing healthcare services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in a low- and middle-income area. The given case that has been highlighted is establishing daycare services focusing on rehabilitation and training services for individuals with ASD, and their caregivers and family members, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Based on my experience, the associated challenges are divided into three primary levels: personal, professional, and organizational. The report highlights the importance of understanding the challenges associated with establishing healthcare services with the desire to put them under control. Plus, understanding the cultural aspects of the healthcare services for individuals with ASD experiences to address the issues at each level shared. It is concluded in the final part of the report that the key to establishing healthcare quality is to understand attitudes toward healthcare at the personal, professional, and organizational levels. This attitude determines the expectation from the services and defines assistance-seeking behaviors. Results offer insight for stakeholders in the healthcare field, allowing for a better understanding and improvement of availability and access to quality-driven healthcare services. A pre- and in-service training approach is practiced to address the associated challenges of establishing healthcare services at the personal level in KRI. A similar policy might be applicable in other LMICs, where there is a lack of professional and skillful healthcare service providers.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Vestibular migraine (VM) and Meni&amp;amp;egrave;re&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (MD) share multiple features in terms of clinical presentations and auditory-vestibular functions, and, therefore, more accurate diagnostic tools to distinguish between the two disorders are needed. (2) Methods: The study was of retrospective design and examined the data of 69 MD patients, 79 VM patients and 72 MD with migraine patients. Five vestibular autorotation test (VAT) parameters, i.e., horizontal gain/phase, vertical gain/phase and asymmetry were subjected to logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the accuracy of the different parameters in the differential diagnosis of MD and VM. (3) Results: Our results showed that the horizontal gain of VAT significantly outperformed other parameters in distinguishing MD and VM. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the horizontal gain were 95.7%, 50.6% and 71.6%, respectively, for the differentiation between VM and MD. In most MD patients, the horizontal gain decreased in the range of 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 Hz, while in most VM patients, horizontal gain increased in the range between 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 Hz. More MD with migraine patients had an increased horizontal gain when the frequency was less than 5.0 Hz and had a decreased horizontal gain when the frequency was greater than 5.0 Hz. (4) Conclusion: Our study suggested the VAT, especially the horizontal gain, as an indicator, may serve as a sensitive and objective indicator that helps distinguish between MD and VM. Moreover, VAT, due to its non-invasive and all-frequency nature, might be an important part of a test battery.</p>

	<p>Background: Alterations of hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis activity and serotonergic signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of human obesity and may contribute to its metabolic and mental complications. The association of these systems has not been investigated in human obesity. Objective: To investigate the relation of HPA responsiveness and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) availability in otherwise healthy individuals with obesity class II or III (OB) compared to non-obesity controls (NO). Study participants: Twenty-eight OB (21 females; age 36.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.6 years; body mass index (BMI) 41.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.1 kg/m2) were compared to 12 healthy NO (8 females; age 35.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.4 years; BMI 22.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.3 kg/m2), matched for age and sex. Methods: HPA axis responsiveness was investigated using the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (dex/CRH) test, and curve indicators were derived for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The 5-HTT selective tracer [11C]DASB was applied, and parametric images of the binding potentials (BPND) were calculated using the multilinear reference tissue model and evaluated by atlas-based volume of interest (VOI) analysis. The self-questionnaires of behavioral inhibition system/behavioral activation system (BIS/BAS) with subscales drive, fun-seeking and reward were assessed. Results: OB showed significant positive correlations of ACTH curve parameters with overall 5-HTT BPND (ACTHAUC: r = 0.39, p = 0.04) and 5-HTT BPND of the caudate nucleus (ACTHAUC: r = 0.54, p = 0.003). In NO, cortisol indicators correlated significantly with BPND in the hippocampus (cortisolAUC: r = 0.59, p = 0.04). In OB, BAS reward was inversely associated with the ACTHAUC (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.49, p = 0.009). Conclusion: The present study supports a serotonergic-neuroendocrine association, which regionally differs between OB and NO. In OB, areas processing emotion and reward seem to be in-volved. The finding of a serotonergic HPA correlation may have implications for other diseases with dysregulated stress axis responsiveness, and for potential pharmacologic interven-tions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dignity in the care of older adults living in nursing homes¬†and long-term care facilities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Depending on the fields and actors involved, dignity may involve, signify, and encompass different meanings. This fundamental right can be subjectively experienced and rooted in a person's perception of being treated and cared for. Care refers to a set of specific activities combined in a complex life-sustaining network, including long-term Care, which involves various services designed to meet a person's health or personal care needs. However, older residents' human rights have been disrespected and widened the gaps between theory and practice regarding the precarious protection of their rights and dignity inside long-term facilities and nursing homes. This paper aims to discuss threats to dignity and elucidate some strategies to promote and conserve dignity in care, including the person-centered practice in long-term care. Some barriers to the dignity of older residents involve the organizational culture, restraints of time, heavy workload, burnout, and lack of partnership between the residents, their families, and the long-term care homes' staff. Person-centered integrated care quality frameworks are core components of a good quality of care in these spaces in high-income countries. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how weak long-term care policies were and demonstrated that much progress in the dignity of care in long-term care facilities and nursing homes is needed. In low- and middle-income countries, long-term care policies do not accompany the accelerated and intense aging process, and there are other threats, like their invisibility to the public sector and the prejudices about this service model. It's urgent to create strategies for designing and implementing sustainable and equitable long- term care systems based on a person-centered service with dignity to everyone who needs it.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal Domain Structure as a Putative Identifier of Neuron-Specific Vulnerability to Oxidative Stress in Cultured Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several populations of neurons are purported to degenerate in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). One current hypothesis suggests that vulnerable neurons in PD share common characteristics including projecting to voluminous territories and having extremely long and branched axonal domains with large numbers of neurotransmitter release sites. In this study, we used a mouse <I>in vitro</I> culture system to compare the axonal domain of neuronal populations suspected to be vulnerable in PD to that of neuronal populations considered at a lesser risk. In the first category, we included dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra, noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), serotonin neurons of the raphe nuclei (R), and cholinergic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). In the second category, we included DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area, cholinergic neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus, and cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum. Validating their differential vulnerability, we find that, when compared with neurons presumed to be resilient in PD, a larger proportion of neurons presumed to be vulnerable in PD degenerate in response to cell stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. We also find that they are endowed with larger axonal domains, that are more complex, have more axonal varicosities with a higher proportion of varicosities that are positive for synaptotagmin 1 (Syt-1). Notwithstanding the obvious limitations related to the dissection of small brain nuclei and to the growth of these neurons <I>in vitro</I>, these findings support the hypothesis that axonal domain structure is a key characteristic of neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption in Preclinical Mouse Models of Stroke Can Be an Experimental Artifact Caused by Craniectomy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The pathophysiological features of ischemia-related blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) disruption are widely studied using preclinical stroke models. However, in many of these models, craniectomy is required to confirm arterial occlusion via laser Doppler flowmetry or to enable direct ligation of the cerebral artery. In the present study, mice were used to construct a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model, a preclinical stroke model that requires craniectomy to enable direct ligation of the cerebral artery, or were subjected to craniectomy alone. dMCAO but not craniectomy caused neurodegeneration and cerebral infarction, but both procedures induced an appreciable increase in BBB permeability to Evans blue dye, fluorescein, and endogenous albumin but not to 10 kDa dextran-FITC, leading to cerebral edema. Using rats, we further showed that BBB disruption induced by craniectomy with no evidence of dural tearing was comparable to that induced by craniectomy involving tearing of the dura. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that craniectomy can be a major contributor to BBB disruption and cerebral edema in preclinical stroke models. The implications of this experimental artifact for translational stroke research and preclinical data interpretation are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.¬† Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used in the macrolide-based treatment. Twelve (10.4%) of NTM were macrolide resistant, with 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM having mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM were resistant to rifampicin, with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene.¬†¬† Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated segmentation of endometriosis using transfer learning technique [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper focuses on segmenting the exact location of endometriosis using the state-of-art technique known as U-Net. Endometriosis is a progressive disorder that has a significant impact on women. The lesion-like appearance that grows inside the uterus and sheds for every periodical cycle is known as endometriosis. If the lesion exists and is transferred to other locations in the women‚Äôs reproductive system, it may lead to a serious problem. Besides radiologists deep learning techniques exist for recognizing the presence and aggravation of endometriosis. Methods: The proposed method known as structural similarity analysis of endometriosis (SSAE) identifies the similarity between pathologically identified and annotated images obtained from standardized dataset known as GLENDA v1.5 by implementing two systematic approaches. The first approach is based on semantic segmentation and the second approach uses statistical analysis. Semantic segmentation is a cutting-edge technology for identifying exact locations by performing pixel-level classification. In semantic segmentation, U-Net is a transfer-learning architecture that works effectively for biomedical image classification. The SSAE implements the U-Net architecture for segmenting endometriosis based on the region of occurrence. The second approach proves the similarity between pathologically identified images and the corresponding annotated images using a statistical evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using calculation of both the mean and standard deviation of all four regions by implementing systematic sampling procedure. Results: The SSAE obtains the intersection over union value of 0.72 and the F1 score of 0.74 for the trained dataset. The means of both the laparoscopic and annotated images for all regions were similar. Consequently, the SSAE facilitated the presence of abnormalities in a specific region. Conclusions: The proposed SSAE approach identifies the affected region using U-Net architecture and systematic sampling procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, psychological issues, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ¬± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetics and functional significance of the understudied methamphetamine sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary discoveries in the field of circadian rhythms. However, there are still several mysteries that remain. One of these chronobiological mysteries is the circadian rhythm that is revealed by administration of stimulant drugs to rodents. Herein we describe the discovery of this circadian rhythm and its underlying oscillator, which is frequently called the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator, or MASCO. This oscillator is distinct from canonical circadian oscillators because it controls robust activity rhythms independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and circadian genes are not essential for its timekeeping. We discuss these fundamental properties of MASCO and integrate¬†studies of strain, sex, and circadian gene mutations on MASCO. The anatomical loci of MASCO are not known, so it has not been possible thus far to discover its novel molecular timekeeping mechanism or its functional significance. However, studies in mutant mice suggest that genetic approaches can be used to identify the neural network involved in the rhythm generation of MASCO. We also discuss parallels between human and rodent studies that support our working hypothesis that a function of MASCO may be to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a technique that is gaining widespread use in molecular evolution studies and protein engineering. Accurate reconstruction requires the ability to handle appropriately large numbers of sequences, as well as insertion and deletion (indel) events, but available approaches exhibit limitations. To address these limitations, we developed Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP), which efficiently implements maximum likelihood methods to enable the inference of ancestors of families with more than 10,000 members. GRASP implements partial order graphs (POGs) to represent and infer insertion and deletion events across ancestors, enabling the identification of building blocks for protein engineering.
To validate the capacity to engineer novel proteins from realistic data, we predicted ancestor sequences across three distinct enzyme families: glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, cytochromes P450, and dihydroxy/sugar acid dehydratases (DHAD). All tested ancestors demonstrated enzymatic activity. Our study demonstrates the ability of GRASP (1) to support large data sets over 10,000 sequences and (2) to employ insertions and deletions to identify building blocks for engineering biologically active ancestors, by exploring variation over evolutionary time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the first wave of COVID-19 in India</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dhiraj Kumar Hazra, Bhalchandra S. Pujari, Snehal M. Shekatkar, Farhina Mozaffer, Sitabhra Sinha, Vishwesha Guttal, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Gautam I. Menon</p>

Estimating the burden of COVID-19 in India is difficult because the extent to which cases and deaths have been undercounted is hard to assess. Here, we use a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured epidemiological compartmental model, which we call the INDSCI-SIM model, to analyse the first wave of COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to daily reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05‚Äî0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries. We find that approximately 35% of India had been infected overall by the end of the first wave, results broadly consistent with those from serosurveys. These results contribute to the understanding of the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 in India.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding the impact of third-party species on pairwise coexistence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jie Deng, Washington Taylor, Serguei Saavedra</p>

The persistence of virtually every single species depends on both the presence of other species and the specific environmental conditions in a given location. Because in natural settings many of these conditions are unknown, research has been centered on finding the fraction of possible conditions (probability) leading to species coexistence. The focus has been on the persistence probability of an entire multispecies community (formed of either two or more species). However, the methodological and philosophical question has always been whether we can observe the entire community and, if not, what the conditions are under which an observed subset of the community can persist as part of a larger multispecies system. Here, we derive long-term (using analytical calculations) and short-term (using simulations and experimental data) system-level indicators of the effect of third-party species on the coexistence probability of a pair (or subset) of species under unknown environmental conditions. We demonstrate that the fraction of conditions incompatible with the possible coexistence of a pair of species tends to become vanishingly small within systems of increasing numbers of species. Yet, the probability of pairwise coexistence in isolation remains approximately the expected probability of pairwise coexistence in more diverse assemblages. In addition, we found that when third-party species tend to reduce (resp. increase) the coexistence probability of a pair, they tend to exhibit slower (resp. faster) rates of competitive exclusion. Long-term and short-term effects of the remaining third-party species on all possible specific pairs in a system are not equally distributed, but these differences can be mapped and anticipated under environmental uncertainty.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has placed a significant burden on public health systems to provide swift and accurate diagnostic testing highlighting the critical need for innovative testing approaches for future pandemics. In this study, we present a novel sample pooling procedure based on compressed sensing theory to accurately identify virally infected patients at high prevalence rates utilizing an innovative viral RNA extraction process to minimize sample dilution. At prevalence rates ranging from 0‚Äì14.3%, the number of tests required to identify the infection status of all patients was reduced by 69.26% as compared to conventional testing in primary human SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a coronavirus model system. Our method provided quantification of individual sample viral load within a pool as well as a binary positive-negative result. Additionally, our modified pooling and RNA extraction process minimized sample dilution which remained constant as pool sizes increased. Compressed sensing can be adapted to a wide variety of diagnostic testing applications to increase throughput for routine laboratory testing as well as a means to increase testing capacity to combat future pandemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel methods for estimating the instantaneous and overall COVID-19 case fatality risk among care home residents in England</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoper E. Overton, Luke Webb, Uma Datta, Mike Fursman, Jo Hardstaff, Iina Hiironen, Karthik Paranthaman, Heather Riley, James Sedgwick, Julia Verne, Steve Wilner, Lorenzo Pellis, Ian Hall</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has had high mortality rates in the elderly and frail worldwide, particularly in care homes. This is driven by the difficulty of isolating care homes from the wider community, the large population sizes within care facilities (relative to typical households), and the age/frailty of the residents. To quantify the mortality risk posed by disease, the case fatality risk (CFR) is an important tool. This quantifies the proportion of cases that result in death. Throughout the pandemic, CFR amongst care home residents in England has been monitored closely. To estimate CFR, we apply both novel and existing methods to data on deaths in care homes, collected by Public Health England and the Care Quality Commission. We compare these different methods, evaluating their relative strengths and weaknesses. Using these methods, we estimate temporal trends in the instantaneous CFR (at both daily and weekly resolutions) and the overall CFR across the whole of England, and dis-aggregated at regional level. We also investigate how the CFR varies based on age and on the type of care required, dis-aggregating by whether care homes include nursing staff and by age of residents. This work has contributed to the summary of measures used for monitoring the UK epidemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural spine plasticity: Learning and forgetting of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Hongyu Meng, Hermann Riecke</p>

Learning to discriminate between different sensory stimuli is essential for survival. In rodents, the olfactory bulb, which contributes to odor discrimination via pattern separation, exhibits extensive structural synaptic plasticity involving the formation and removal of synaptic spines, even in adult animals. The network connectivity resulting from this plasticity is still poorly understood. To gain insight into this connectivity we present here a computational model for the structural plasticity of the reciprocal synapses between the dominant population of excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. It incorporates the observed modulation of spine stability by odor exposure. The model captures the striking experimental observation that the exposure to odors does not always enhance their discriminability: while training with similar odors enhanced their discriminability, training with dissimilar odors actually <i>reduced</i> the discriminability of the training stimuli. Strikingly, this differential learning does not require the activity-dependence of the spine stability and occurs also in a model with purely random spine dynamics in which the spine density is changed homogeneously, e.g., due to a global signal. However, the experimentally observed odor-specific reduction in the response of principal cells as a result of extended odor exposure and the concurrent disinhibition of a subset of principal cells arise only in the activity-dependent model. Moreover, this model predicts the experimentally testable recovery of odor response through weak but not through strong odor re-exposure and the forgetting of odors via exposure to interfering odors. Combined with the experimental observations, the computational model provides strong support for the prediction that odor exposure leads to the formation of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mechanics of lung cancer: A finite element model shows strain amplification during early tumorigenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca G. Zitnay, Michael R. Herron, Keith R. Carney, Scott Potter, Lyska L. Emerson, Jeffrey A. Weiss, Michelle C. Mendoza</p>

Early lung cancer lesions develop within a unique microenvironment that undergoes constant cyclic stretch from respiration. While tumor stiffening is an established driver of tumor progression, the contribution of stress and strain to lung cancer is unknown. We developed tissue scale finite element models of lung tissue to test how early lesions alter respiration-induced strain. We found that an early tumor, represented as alveolar filling, amplified the strain experienced in the adjacent alveolar walls. Tumor stiffening further increased the amplitude of the strain in the adjacent alveolar walls and extended the strain amplification deeper into the normal lung. In contrast, the strain experienced in the tumor proper was less than the applied strain, although regions of amplification appeared at the tumor edge. Measurements of the alveolar wall thickness in clinical and mouse model samples of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) showed wall thickening adjacent to the tumors, consistent with cellular response to strain. Modeling alveolar wall thickening by encircling the tumor with thickened walls moved the strain amplification radially outward, to the next adjacent alveolus. Simulating iterative thickening in response to amplified strain produced tracks of thickened walls. We observed such tracks in early-stage clinical samples. The tracks were populated with invading tumor cells, suggesting that strain amplification in very early lung lesions could guide pro-invasive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The simulation results and tumor measurements suggest that cells at the edge of a lung tumor and in surrounding alveolar walls experience increased strain during respiration that could promote tumor progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Phosphoinositide species and filamentous actin formation mediate engulfment by senescent tumor cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wesley D. Frey, Ashlyn Y. Anderson, Hyemin Lee, Julie B. Nguyen, Emma L. Cowles, Hua Lu, James G. Jackson</p>

Cancer cells survive chemotherapy and cause lethal relapse by entering a senescent state that facilitates expression of many phagocytosis/macrophage-related genes that engender a novel cannibalism phenotype. We used biosensors and live-cell imaging to reveal the basic steps and mechanisms of engulfment by senescent human and mouse tumor cells. We show filamentous actin in predator cells was localized to the prey cell throughout the process of engulfment. Biosensors to various phosphoinositide (PI) species revealed increased concentration and distinct localization of predator PI(4) P and PI(4,5)P2 at the prey cell during early stages of engulfment, followed by a transient burst of PI(3) P before and following internalization. PIK3C2B, the kinase responsible for generating PI(3)P, was required for complete engulfment. Inhibition or knockdown of Clathrin, known to associate with PIK3C2B and PI(4,5)P2, severely impaired engulfment. In sum, our data reveal the most fundamental cellular processes of senescent cell engulfment, including the precise localizations and dynamics of actin and PI species throughout the entire process.

                Background: Cardiovascular involvement is not well studied in children with sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the echocardiographic parameters and to investigate speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) interest in detecting subclinical myocardial impairment of children with sickle cell disease. Methods: The study was directed in the echocardiographic laboratory in the military hospital of Tunis between July 2018 and December 2018. 30 patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and 30 controls were compared. The echocardiographic measurements were indexed according to body surface. Cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction, wall thickness, as well as LV 2-D longitudinal systolic strain were assessed. Results: The SCA Group included 30 patients (11.8 ¬± 2yrs, sex ratio: 1.31) with homozygous SCA and the C Group included 30 healthy controls (12.7 ¬± 1,2yrs, sex ratio: 1.27). According to the findings, SCA Group showed significantly larger LV diameter (36.2¬±2.5mm/m2 vs 29.3¬±1.3mm/m2, p=0.005). SCA Group also showed lower LV ejection fraction (62%¬±0.5 vs 65%¬±5, p=0.001). No significant difference was observed for cardiac output (p=0.4). Otherwise, two-dimensional longitudinal strain of LV was higher in SCA group (-21%¬±3.07 vs -25%¬±2.98; p<0.01). Conclusions: Our study highlights several cardiac abnormalities in children with SCA, which could represent a marker of disease severity and point out the importance of the cardiologic screening of these patients.

                Tropical sprue (TS) is a post-infective disease of the small bowel characterized by a malabsorption syndrome affecting tropics inhabitants and visitors. Diagnosis of TS remain challenging since it can be confused with common diarrheal diseases, especially in non-endemic areas. We report a Tunisian case of latent TS. A 58-year-old male with a history of chronic watery diarrhea, was admitted to the intensive care unit for confusion which was related to severe metabolic acidosis. Despite the neurological improvement after hydro-electrolytic resuscitation and acid-base disorders correction, the patient continued to have three to five loose stools daily. A nutritional assessment showed a malabsorption syndrome: iron, Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies; normochromic normocytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal villous atrophy and biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a thickened hyalonalized sub-epithelial basal lamina. Celiac disease was evoked, however the patient did not improve on a gluten-free diet and the celiac serology was negative. On re-interviewing, we discovered that the patient had spent two months in India three years prior. Given the travel history, clinico-biological and histological data TS was highly considered and a good response to a five-month antibiotic course combined to nutritional supplementation supported this diagnosis. Clinico-biological, endoscopic and histological findings were overlapping between TS and other malabsorption diseases, explaining diagnosis difficulties. TS should be systematically discussed in tropics visitors presenting with chronic diarrhea. Improvement after micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies replacement combined to a prolonged antibiotic course supports the diagnosis of TS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural dynamics of causal inference in the macaque frontoparietal circuit</a></h4>

              
                Natural perception relies inherently on inferring causal structure in the environment. However, the neural mechanisms and functional circuits essential for representing and updating the hidden causal structure and corresponding sensory representations during multisensory processing are unknown. To address this, monkeys were trained to infer the probability of a potential common source from visual and proprioceptive signals based on their spatial disparity in a virtual reality system. The proprioceptive drift reported by monkeys demonstrated that they combined previous experience and current multisensory signals to estimate the hidden common source and subsequently updated the causal structure and sensory representation. Single-unit recordings in premotor and parietal cortices revealed that neural activity in the premotor cortex represents the core computation of causal inference, characterizing the estimation and update of the likelihood of integrating multiple sensory inputs at a trial-by-trial level. In response to signals from the premotor cortex, neural activity in the parietal cortex also represents the causal structure and further dynamically updates the sensory representation to maintain consistency with the causal inference structure. Thus, our results indicate how the premotor cortex integrates previous experience and sensory inputs to infer hidden variables and selectively updates sensory representations in the parietal cortex to support behavior. This dynamic loop of frontal-parietal interactions in the causal inference framework may provide the neural mechanism to answer long-standing questions regarding how neural circuits represent hidden structures for body awareness and agency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NaV1.1 is essential for proprioceptive signaling and motor behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>), Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, is well-studied in the central nervous system; conversely, its contribution to peripheral sensory neuron function is more enigmatic. Here, we identify a new role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in mammalian proprioception. RNAscope analysis and <i>in vitro</i> patch clamp recordings in genetically identified mouse proprioceptors show ubiquitous channel expression and significant contributions to intrinsic excitability. Notably, genetic deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons caused profound and visible motor coordination deficits in conditional knockout mice of both sexes, similar to conditional Piezo2-knockout animals, suggesting this channel is a major contributor to sensory proprioceptive transmission. <i>Ex vivo</i> muscle afferent recordings from conditional knockout mice found that loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 leads to inconsistent and unreliable proprioceptor firing characterized by action potential failures during static muscle stretch; conversely, afferent responses to dynamic vibrations were unaffected. This suggests that while a combination of Piezo2 and other Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms are sufficient to elicit activity in response to transient stimuli, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is required for transmission of receptor potentials generated during sustained muscle stretch. Impressively, recordings from afferents of heterozygous conditional knockout animals were similarly impaired, and heterozygous conditional knockout mice also exhibited motor behavioral deficits. Thus, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 haploinsufficiency in sensory neurons impairs both proprioceptor function and motor behaviors. Importantly, human patients harboring Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 loss-of-function mutations often present with motor delays and ataxia; therefore, our data suggest sensory neuron dysfunction contributes to the clinical manifestations of neurological disorders in which Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function is compromised. Collectively, we present the first evidence that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is essential for mammalian proprioceptive signaling and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recalibrating vision-for-action requires years after sight restoration from congenital cataracts</a></h4>

              
                Being able to perform adept goal-directed actions requires predictive, feed-forward control, including a mapping between the visually estimated target locations and the motor commands reaching for them. When the mapping is perturbed, e.g., due to muscle fatigue or optical distortions, we are quickly able to recalibrate the sensorimotor system to update this mapping. Here we investigated whether early visual and visuomotor experience is essential for developing sensorimotor recalibration. To this end, we assessed young individuals deprived from pattern vision due to dense congenital bilateral cataracts, who were surgically treated for sight restoration only years after birth. We compared their recalibration performance to such distortion to that of age-matched sighted controls. Their sensorimotor recalibration performance was impaired right after surgery. This finding cannot be explained by their still lower visual acuity alone, since blurring vision in controls to a matching degree did not lead to comparable behavior.  Nevertheless, the recalibration ability of cataract-treated participants gradually improved with time after surgery. Thus, the lack of early pattern vision affects visuomotor recalibration. However, this ability is not lost but slowly develops after sight restoration, highlighting the importance of sensorimotor experience gained late in life.

                Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the most potent producer of type I interferon (IFN), but how pDC are primed <i>in vivo</i> is poorly defined. Using a mouse model of severe malaria, we have previously established that upon priming by CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages (MP), pDC initiate type I IFN-I secretion in the bone marrow (BM) of infected mice via cell-intrinsic TLR7 sensing and cell-extrinsic STING sensing. Herein we show that CD169<sup>+</sup> MP and TLR7-sensing are both required for pDC arrest during priming, suggesting CD169<sup>+</sup> MP are the source of TLR7 ligands. We establish that TLR7 sensing in pDC and chemotaxis are both required for pDC arrest and functional communication with CD169<sup>+</sup> MP in the BM. Lastly, we demonstrate that STING-sensing in CD169<sup>+</sup> MP control pDC initiation of type I IFN production while also regulating pDC clustering and retention/egress from the BM. Collectively, these results link pDC acquisition of type I IFN secreting capacity with changes in their motility, homing and interactions with CD169<sup>+</sup> MP during infection. Thus, targeting this cellular interaction may help modulate type I IFN to improve outcomes of microbial infections and autoimmune diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nature over Nurture: Functional neuronal circuits emerge in the absence of developmental activity</a></h4>

              
                During development, the complex neuronal circuitry of the brain arises from limited information contained in the genome. After the genetic code instructs the birth of neurons, the emergence of brain regions, and the formation of axon tracts, it is believed that neuronal activity plays a critical role in shaping circuits for behavior. Current AI technologies are modeled after the same principle: connections in an initial weight matrix are pruned and strengthened by activity-dependent signals until the network can sufficiently generalize a set of inputs into outputs. Here, we challenge these learning-dominated assumptions by quantifying the contribution of neuronal activity to the development of visually guided swimming behavior in larval zebrafish. Intriguingly, dark-rearing zebrafish revealed that visual experience has no effect on the emergence of the optomotor response (OMR). We then raised animals under conditions where neuronal activity was pharmacologically silenced from organogenesis onward using the sodium-channel blocker tricaine. Strikingly, after washout of the anesthetic, animals performed swim bouts and responded to visual stimuli with 75% accuracy in the OMR paradigm. After shorter periods of silenced activity OMR performance stayed above 90% accuracy, calling into question the importance and impact of classical critical periods for visual development. Detailed quantification of the emergence of functional circuit properties by brain-wide imaging experiments confirmed that neuronal circuits came 'online' fully tuned and without the requirement for activity-dependent plasticity. Thus, we find that complex sensory guided behaviors can be wired up by activity-independent developmental mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of function in the autism and schizophrenia-associated gene CYFIP1 in human microglia supports a role in synaptic pruning</a></h4>

              
                Background: The CYFIP1 gene, located in the neurodevelopmental risk locus 15q11.2, is highly expressed in microglia, but its role in human microglial function as it relates to neurodevelopment is not well understood. Methods: We generated multiple CRISPR knockouts of CYFIP1 in patient-derived models of microglia to characterize function and phenotype. Using microglia-like cells reprogrammed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we quantified phagocytosis of synaptosomes (isolated and purified synaptic vesicles) from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures as an in vitro model of synaptic pruning. We repeated these analyses in human iPSC-derived microglia, and characterized microglial development and function through morphology and motility. Results: CYFIP1 knockout using orthogonal CRISPR constructs in multiple patient-derived cell lines was associated with statistically significant decrease in synaptic vesicle phagocytosis in microglia models derived from both PBMCs and iPSCs (p<0.0001). Morphology was also shifted toward a more ramified profile (p<0.0001), and motility was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). However, iPSC-CYFIP1 knockout lines retained the ability to differentiate to functional microglia. Conclusion: The changes in microglial phenotype and function from loss of CYFIP1 may contribute to pruning abnormalities observed in CYFIP1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Investigating risk genes in a range of CNS cell types may be required to fully understand the way in which common and rare variants intersect to yield neuropsychiatric disorders.

                It has been recognized that the efficacy of TMS-based modulation may depend on the network profile of the stimulated regions throughout the brain. However, what profile of this stimulation network optimally benefits treatment outcomes is yet to be addressed. The answer to the question is crucial for informing network-based optimization of stimulation parameters, such as coil placement, in TMS treatments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of taking a disease-specific network as the target of stimulation network for guiding individualized coil placement in TMS treatments. We present here a novel network-based model for TMS targeting of the pathological network. First, combining E-field modeling and resting-state functional connectivity, stimulation networks were modeled from locations and orientations of the TMS coil. Second, the spatial anti-correlation between the stimulation network and the pathological network of a given disease was hypothesized to predict the treatment outcome. The proposed model was validated to predict treatment efficacy from the position and orientation of TMS coils in two depression cohorts and one auditory verbal hallucinations cohort. We further demonstrate the utility of the proposed model in guiding individualized TMS treatment for psychiatric disorders. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the feasibility of the novel network-based targeting strategy that uses the whole-brain, system-level abnormity of a specific psychiatric disease as a target. Results based on empirical data suggest that the strategy may potentially be utilized to identify individualized coil parameters for maximal therapeutic effects.

                Synaptic dysfunction, weakening, and loss of synapses are well-correlated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have implicated hyper-activation of the complement cascade as the driving force for loss of synapses in AD. However, the synaptic cues to trigger pathological complement activity remain elusive. To address this, we studied the actions of oligomeric, 42 residue length amyloid {beta} (oA{beta}) on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) at hippocampal CA1 synapses, a form of synaptic plasticity that is disrupted in rodent models of AD. We found that exogenous application of oA{beta} to mouse hippocampal slices enhanced the magnitude of mGluR subtype 5 (mGlu5R)-dependent LTD. This enhanced synaptic weakening occurred via both NMDARs and complement C3aR/C5aR signaling, as revealed by pharmacological inhibition experiments. Our findings reveal a novel mechanistic interaction between mGlu5R, NMDARs, and the complement cascade in synaptic weakening induced by oA{beta}, which could represent an early trigger of synaptic degeneration in AD.

                Primates actively touch objects with their hands to collect information. In investigations of the tactile information processes, participants should experience tactile stimuli through active touch while brain activities are monitored. Here, we developed a pneumatic tactile stimulus delivery system (pTDS) that delivers various tactile stimuli on a programmed schedule and allows tactile perception through voluntary finger touches during MRI scanning. A pneumatic actuator moved tactile blocks and placed one in a finger hole. The time when an index finger touched a tactile stimulus was detected with a photosensor, allowing analysis of the touch-elicited brain responses. The brain responses were examined while the participants actively touched braille objects presented by the pTDS. BOLD responses during tactile perception were significantly stronger in a finger touch area of the contralateral somatosensory cortex compared with that of visual perception. This pTDS enables MR study of brain mechanisms for tactile processes through natural finger touch.

                Sleep awake cycle is critical for cognitive and functional abilities. Conventional sleep homeostasis mechanisms are neuronal in nature and recent views indicate glial regulation of the sleep-wake process. Mechanisms of homeostatic regulation of sleep remain to be understood. A simplified astrocytic sleep-awake homeostasis mathematical model with sleep pressure and synaptic strength dynamics is proposed using feedback control loops. The model provides insights into the emergence of two discrete states through sleep and awake promoting neuronal populations giving rise to a homeostatic process S and oscillatory process C is regulated by astrocytic sleep pressure. It also explains the variations seen in synaptic strength dynamics during sleep and awake states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic hippocampal-cortical interactions during event boundaries support retention of complex narrative events</a></h4>

              
                According to most memory theories, encoding involves continuous communication between the hippocampus and neocortex leaving the temporal dynamics of hippocampal-neocortical interactions often overlooked. Recent work has shown that we perceive complex events in our lives as dynamic, with relatively distinct starting and stopping points known as event boundaries. Event boundaries may be important for memory, as they are associated with increased activity in the hippocampus, and extended neocortical regions (the posterior cingulate cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex). Our objective was to determine how functional connectivity between the hippocampus and neocortical regions during the encoding of naturalistic events (movies) related to subsequent retrieval and retention of those events. Participants encoded two 16-minute cartoon movies during fMRI scanning. After encoding, participants freely recalled one of the movies immediately, and the other after a 2-day delay. We quantified hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity (FC) at time windows around each event onset, middle, and offset, and compared these FC measures with subsequent recall. These analyses revealed that higher FC between the hippocampus and the posterior medial network (PMN) at an event's offset related to whether that event was subsequently recalled. In contrast, mid-event connectivity between the hippocampus and PMN was associated with poorer memory. Furthermore, hippocampal-PMN offset connectivity predicted not only whether events were retained in memory, but also the degree to which these events could be recalled in detail after a 2-day delay. These data demonstrate that the relationship between memory encoding and hippocampal-neocortical interaction is more dynamic than suggested by most memory theories, and they converge with recent modeling work suggesting that event offset is an optimal time for encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time or distance: predictive coding of Hippocampal cells</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of place cells within the hippocampus has pointed to the importance of the hippocampus for navigation. The more recent discovery of hippocampal time cells has broadened the perspective of encoding in the hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis to the existence of time cells is based on the notion that hippocampal cells deduce location by integrating travelled distance ("path integration"). According to this alternate hypothesis, time cells, which fire at particular times when animals are running on a treadmill without changing location, actually encode accumulated distance on the treadmill. To examine this hypothesis, Kraus et al. performed treadmill experiments in which animals either ran for a fixed time or a fixed distance with varying velocities. Two distinct coding modes of hippocampal principal cells were found. Some cells encoded travelled distance and others elapsed time, thus refuting the notion that all hippocampal cells were performing path integration. Using the data from these experiments, we asked whether the two populations depended on the type of task the rats were engaged in. We show that the type of experiment determined the cells' encoding, such that in fixed-distance experiments distance-encoding cells dominated, while on fixed-time experiments time-encoding cells dominated. These results suggest that the cells' encoding contains a predictive element, dependent on the important variables of the experiment.

                Neuronal subnetworks are common features of adult cortical circuits and serve as functional units for information processing and encoding. To determine when neuronal subnetworks are established, we employed in vivo calcium imaging to monitor neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice during early postnatal development. We found several striking developmental trajectories: (1) neuronal activity frequencies and network synchrony were sex-dependent; (2) neuronal subnetworks merged as early as P11; (3) the number of neurons in a subnetwork decreases with increasing age; (4) subnetwork neurons are initially spatially segregated, but become intermingled with other subnetworks neurons with increasing age; (5) neurons within the same subnetwork acquire a more cohesive activity pattern as age increases, and (6) enhancing GABAergic activity at P15 acutely increased female but not male subnetwork coherence. Together, our findings demonstrate that P11-P21 is the critical time for subnetwork assembly and GABAergic inputs strengthen subnetwork coherence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult lifespan trajectories of neuromagnetic signals and interrelations with cortical thickness</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory power and phase synchronization map neuronal dynamics and are commonly studied to describe the healthy or diseased brain. Yet, little is known about the course of these features from early adulthood into old age. Leveraging magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting-state data in a cross-sectional adult sample (n = 350), we probed lifespan differences (18-88 years) in connectivity and power and interaction effects with sex. Building upon recent attempts to link structure and function in the brain, we tested the spatial correspondence of age effects on cortical thickness and those on functional networks and a direct relationship at the level of the study sample. We found MEG frequency-specific patterns for lower- and higher-order brain regions and divergence between sexes in low frequencies. Connectivity and power exhibited distinct linear trajectories with age or turning points at midlife. Variability in cortical thickness with age corresponded to those in neuromagnetic activity, particularly in delta and beta oscillations, and showed coupling in either unimodal or transmodal regions depending on the frequency. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive overview of the topographic functional profile of adulthood that can form a basis for neurocognitive and clinical investigations. This study further sheds new light on how the brain's structural architecture relates to fast oscillatory activity in large-scale networks.

                The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) integrates homeostatic processes and reward-motivated behaviors. Here we show that LHA neurons that produce melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are dynamically responsive to both food-directed appetitive and consummatory processes. Specifically, our results reveal that MCH neuron Ca+2 activity increases in response to both discrete and contextual food-predictive cues and is correlated with food-motivated responses. MCH neuron activity also increases during eating and this response is highly predictive of caloric consumption and declines throughout a meal, thus supporting a role for MCH neurons in the positive feedback consummatory process known as appetition. These physiological MCH neural responses are functionally-relevant as chemogenetic MCH neuron activation promotes appetitive behavioral responses to food-predictive cues and increases meal size. Finally, MCH neuron activation enhances preference for a noncaloric flavor paired with intragastric glucose. Collectively, these data identify a hypothalamic neural population that orchestrates both food-motivated appetitive and intake-promoting consummatory processes.

                Perturbations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes disrupt neural circuit dynamics and ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities. To understand how ASD-implicated genes influence network computation during behavior, we performed in vivo calcium imaging from hundreds of individual hippocampal CA1 neurons simultaneously in freely locomoting mice with total knockout of NEXMIF. NEXMIF is an ASD risk gene most highly expressed in the hippocampus, and NEXMIF knockout in mice creates a range of behavioral deficits, including impaired hippocampal-dependent memory. We found that NEXMIF knockout does not alter the overall excitability of individual neurons but exaggerates movement-mediated neuronal responses. At the network level, NEXMIF knockout creates over-synchronization of the CA1 circuit, quantified by pairwise correlation and network closeness centrality. These neuronal effects observed upon NEXMIF knockout highlight the network consequences of perturbations in ASD-implicated genes, which have broad implications for cognitive performance and other ASD-related behavioral disruptions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological correlates of associative recognition memory for identity, spatial, and temporal relations</a></h4>

              
                The formation of associative representations and their retrieval from episodic memory are vital cognitive functions. However, it is unclear to what extent retrieval of the basic component relations of episodic memory, identity, time, and space, requires different or shared brain mechanisms. In the current study, we employed EEG to track the time courses of electrophysiological correlates of retrieval processes of memory for identity relations, temporal order, and spatial configuration. Participants engaged in pair-associate learning of serially presented and spatially configured object picture pairs, followed by discrimination of identity, spatially, or temporally intact and rearranged pairs. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed distinct patterns of activity during successful retrieval of identity, spatial, and temporal relations that differed by the status of association, across the three retrieval time windows examined (300-500, 500-800, and 800-1000 ms). The identity relations condition was distinguished by a widespread greater negative-going deflection for rearranged relative to intact pairs in all three time windows. For the temporal relations condition, we observed a widespread more negative-going deflection for rearranged than intact pairs, significant in the second time window only. For the spatial relations condition, there was a widespread positive-going deflection greater for rearranged than for intact pairs, significant in the early and in middle time windows. These patterns of activity suggest that retrieval of associative memory traces for identity, spatial, and temporal relationships involve dynamically different processes, which may partially rely on different sets of basic associative mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The matrisome of the murine and human dorsal root ganglion: a transcriptomal approach</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic structure composed of a large number of molecules that can be divided into six different categories and are collectively called the matrisome. The ECM plays pivotal roles in physiological and pathological processes in many tissues, including the nervous system. Intriguingly, alterations in ECM molecules/pathways are often associated with painful human conditions and murine experimental pain models. Nevertheless, mechanistic insight into the interplay of normal or defective ECM and pain is largely lacking. To expand the knowledge on ECM composition and synthesis in the peripheral nervous system, we used a transcriptomal approach to investigate the expression and cellular origin of matrisome genes in murine and human dorsal root ganglia (DRG), containing the cell bodies of sensory neurons. Bulk RNA sequencing data showed that over 60% of all matrisome genes were expressed in both murine and human DRG, with proportionally more core matrisome genes (glycoproteins, collagens, and proteoglycans) expressed compared to matrisome-associated genes (ECM-affiliated genes, ECM regulators and secreted factors). Examination of the cellular origin of matrisome expression by single cell RNA sequencing on murine DRG revealed that core matrisome genes, especially collagens, were expressed by vascular leptomeningeal-like (fibroblast) cell types whereas matrisome-associated genes were mainly expressed by neuronal cell types. We analyzed cell-cell communication networks with the CellChat R package and predicted an important role for the Collagen signaling pathway in connecting vascular cell types and nociceptors in murine tissue, which we confirmed by analysis of spatial transcriptomic data from human DRG. RNAscope in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of collagens in fibroblasts surrounding nociceptors in human DRG. This study supports the idea that the DRG matrisome may contribute to neuronal signaling in both mouse and human. The identification of the cellular distribution of murine and human matrisome genes provides a framework to study the role of the ECM in peripheral nervous tissue and its effects on pain signaling.

                Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in the brain is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and can be an indicator of early disease progression. Thus, the non-invasively and inexpensively observable features related to A{beta} accumulation are promising biomarkers. However, in the experimental discovery of biomarkers in preclinical models, A{beta} and biomarker candidates are usually not observed in identical sample populations. This study established a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts A{beta} accumulation level solely from biomarker candidates by integrating incomplete information. The model was applied to 5xFAD mouse behavioral experimental data. The predicted A{beta} accumulation level obeyed the observed amount of A{beta} when multiple features were used for learning and prediction. Based on the evaluation of predictability, the results suggest that the proposed model can contribute to discovering novel biomarkers, that is, multivariate biomarkers relevant to the accumulation state of abnormal proteins.

                Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neuromuscular disease with limited therapeutic options. Diagnostic and surrogate endpoint biomarkers are needed for early disease detection, clinical trial design, and personalized medicine. Methods: We tested the predictive power of a large set of primary skin fibroblast (n=443) from sporadic and familial ALS patients and healthy controls. We measured morphometric features of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosomes by imaging with vital dyes. We also analysed immunofluorescence images of ALS-linked proteins, including TDP-43 and stress granule components. We studied fibroblasts under basal conditions and under metabolic (galactose medium), oxidative (arsenite), and heat stress conditions. We then employed machine learning (ML) techniques on the dataset to develop biomarkers. Results: Stress perturbations caused robust changes in the measured features, such as organellar morphology, stress granule formation, and TDP-43 mislocalization. ML approaches were able to predict the perturbation with near perfect performance (ROC-AUC > 0.99). However, when trying to predict disease state or disease groups (e.g., sporadic, or familial ALS), the performance of the ML algorithm was more modest (ROC-AUC Control vs ALS = 0.63). We also detected modest but significant scores when predicting clinical features, such as age of onset (ROC-AUC late vs early = 0.60). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the ML morphometry we developed can accurately predict if human fibroblasts are under stress, but the differences between ALS and controls, while statistically significant, are small and pose a challenge for the development of biomarkers for clinical use by these approaches.

                Cephalopod molluscs are growing in popularity and use as comparative models of complex brains and behaviors. Although the gross anatomy of their central and peripheral nervous systems have been well characterized for decades, there is still very limited information about the diversity of cell types in each ganglion or lobe, their arrangement or their network properties. Unlike more standard neuroscience models, there are limited tools available for cephalopods and few validated techniques for imaging neural activity. Here, live calcium imaging in a reduced preparation of the stellate ganglion and mantle tissue reveals mechanosensory afferents and interneurons, which are arranged somatotopically in the ganglion. Retrograde labeling from stellate nerves confirms that neurons sending axonal projections to distinct dermatomes are organized in roughly oblong clusters along the dorsal side of the ganglion. This is the first demonstration of afferent somatotopy in cephalopods, and the first direct visualization of mechanoreceptive and mechano-nociceptive neurons that fire in response to localized, firm touch on the body surface. The methods and findings in this study open multiple new lines of enquiry related to sensory processing in the cephalopod nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for an Intricate Relationship Between Express Visuomotor Responses, Postural Control and Rapid Step Initiation in the Lower Limbs</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has described express visuomotor responses (EVRs) on the upper limb. EVRs are directionally-tuned bursts of muscle activity that occur within 100 ms of visual stimulus appearance, facilitating rapid reaching. Rapid stepping responses are also important in daily life, and while there is evidence of EVR expression on lower limbs, it is unknown whether lower-limb EVRs are influenced by increased postural demands. Here, we investigate the interaction between stepping-related EVRs and anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) that typically precede step initiation. 16 healthy young subjects rapidly stepped towards visual targets presented in front of the left or right foot. We recorded bilateral surface EMG of gluteus medius (GM), a muscle involved in both APAs and stepping, and bilateral ground reaction forces. Two conditions were introduced: a lateral or medial stepping condition with reduced or increased postural demands, respectively. In the lateral stepping condition, EVRs were robustly and strongly present in stance-side GM, and ground reaction forces revealed the absence of APAs. Larger EVRs preceded shorter RTs, consistent with EVRs facilitating step initiation. In contrast, in the medial stepping condition, EVRs were largely absent, and ground reaction forces revealed the consistent presence of APAs. When occasionally present, EVRs in the medial stepping condition preceded larger APAs and longer RTs. Thus, while EVRs in lower limbs can facilitate rapid stepping, their expression is normally suppressed when postural stability is low. Failing to appropriately suppress EVRs in such situations disrupts postural stability, necessitating larger compensatory APAs and leading to longer stepping RTs.

                Brain networks supporting visual memory include extrastriate and other cortical regions associated with visual perception, which manifest domain-specific processing of "where," "how," and various aspects of "what" information. However, whether and how such specialization affects memory for these types of information is still a matter of debate. Functional neuroimaging studies point to dissociable as well as common network components supporting the perception and memory of different aspects of visual information. In the current neuropsychological study, we assess the impact of stroke lesion topography on recall of identity, location, and action of event participants, as assessed by the WMS-III Family Pictures subtest. We used voxel-based lesion-behavior mapping (VLBM) to identify brain lesions specifically implicated in memory deficits for each dimension. Behavioral analysis disclosed impaired performance by both right- and left-hemisphere damage patients, with lesions on each side yielding distinct effects. VLBM analysis revealed a bi-hemispheric network supporting these various aspects of visual memory. In the right hemisphere, the network includes frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical regions and the basal ganglia. In the left hemisphere, the network is more restricted, including visual association areas and medial temporal lobe regions. We further observed that a subset of these regions - those included in the ventral ("what") stream, and in the putative core recollection network - is implicated in multiple aspects of visual memory, whereas other areas are specifically implicated in memory for specific aspects of the visual scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective retrieval revealed by electroencephalographic (EEG) neural pattern reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                For past experiences to guide our actions we need to retrieve the relevant memories. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how a memory is selected for retrieval from a large store of mnemonic traces, and to evaluate how selection operates during the retrieval cascade. We analyzed data from two studies in which people studied objects in picture or auditory word formats, and later recalled them using either written words (Experiment 1, N=28) or line drawings (Experiment 2, N=28) as retrieval cues. We used multivariate decoding to quantify the reinstatement of study phase neural patterns when people successfully identified items that had been studied in the format currently designated as targets, versus non-targeted items. Neural reinstatement emerged by 500 ms post-stimulus, as did the established left parietal event-related potential (ERP) signature of recollection. Reinstatement was also target-selective (greater for targets than non-targets) when test cues overlapped more with targets, as had previously been shown for the left parietal ERP (Moccia and Morcom, 2021). In contrast, when cues overlapped more with non-targets, neural reinstatement was non-selective or reversed, unlike the left parietal ERP. We also tested for goal-directed reinstatement prior to retrieval cues, hypothesized to drive selection. When words were cues there was strong evidence of this proactive reinstatement, but it was not detected when pictures were cues. Together, the data suggest that selection can act at multiple stages of recovery of a memory and depends on both external cues and goal-directed control.

                Afferents of peripheral mechanoreceptors innervate the skin of vertebrates, where they detect physical touch via mechanically gated ion channels (mechanotransducers). While the afferent terminal is generally understood to be the primary site of mechanotransduction, the functional properties of mechanically activated (MA) ionic current generated by mechanotransducers at this location remain obscure. Here, we report patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminal innervating Grandry (Meissner) corpuscles in the bill skin of a tactile specialist duck. We show that mechanical stimulation evokes MA current in the afferent with fast kinetics of activation and inactivation during the dynamic phases of the mechanical stimulus. These responses trigger rapidly adapting firing in the afferent detected at the terminal and in the afferent fiber outside of the corpuscle. Our findings elucidate the initial electrogenic events of touch detection in the mechanoreceptor nerve terminal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High Angular Resolution Susceptibility Imaging and Estimation of Fiber Orientation Distribution Functions in Primate Brain</a></h4>

              
                Uncovering brain-tissue microstructure including axonal characteristics is a major neuroimaging research focus. Within this scope, anisotropic properties of magnetic susceptibility in white matter have been successfully employed to estimate primary axonal trajectories using mono-tensorial models. However, anisotropic susceptibility has not yet been considered for modeling more complex fiber structures within a voxel, such as intersecting bundles, or an estimation of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). This information is routinely obtained by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) techniques. In applications to fixed tissue, however, diffusion-weighted imaging suffers from an inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution, leading to high demands on the performance of the gradient system in order to mitigate these limitations. In the current work, high angular resolution susceptibility imaging (HARSI) is proposed as a novel, phase-based methodology to estimate ODFs. A multiple gradient-echo dataset was acquired in an entire fixed chimpanzee brain at 61 orientations by reorienting the specimen in the magnetic field. The constant solid angle method was adapted for estimating phase-based ODFs. HARDI data were also acquired for comparison. HARSI yielded information on whole-brain fiber architecture, including identification of peaks of multiple bundles that resembled features of the HARDI results. Distinct differences between both methods suggest that susceptibility properties may offer complementary microstructural information. These proof-of-concept results indicate a potential to study the axonal organization in post-mortem primate and human brain at high resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Brainstem Response as an Objective Measure of Temporal Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Background and Aims: Temporal resolution is assessed using behavioral tests, which are highly affected by extraneous variables. We explored the relationship between behavioral Across-Channel Gap Detection Threshold (AC GDT) and different temporal parameters of an objective measure, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), to account for the extraneous variables. Settings and Design: We conducted an experimental study on thirty native Kannada-speaking adults with normal hearing sensitivity in the age range of 18-25 years. Materials and Methods: We estimated the Gap detection threshold (GDT) using an across-channel (AC) paradigm, and Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) was recorded at 80 dBnHL for three repetition rates of 11.1, 30.1, and 90.1/sec. Statistical Analyses used: Normality testing, the Friedman test, post-hoc analysis by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, along with descriptive statistics was performed using SPSS v20 (IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences, New York, USA). Results: The results showed a significant positive correlation between AC GDT scores and latency of wave I for the repetition rates of 11.1 and 30.1/sec and latency of wave V at 30.1 and 90.1/sec. There was a negative correlation (but not significant) between AC GDT scores and the slope of wave V across the repetition rates. Conclusions: The results suggest a relationship between the behavioral and electrophysiological measures of temporal processing. Measuring the latency of wave I and wave V of ABR would give an estimate of their AC GDT scores, especially in difficult-to-test populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptopodin-associated ribosomal hubs regulate lesion-induced homeostatic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neurological diseases can lead to the denervation of brain regions caused by demyelination, traumatic injury or cell death. Nevertheless, the molecular and structural mechanisms underlying the lesion-induced reorganization of denervated brain regions are a matter of ongoing investigation. In order to address this issue, we performed an entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) in organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures and studied denervation-induced homeostatic plasticity of mossy fiber synapses, which connect dentate granule cells with CA3 pyramidal neurons and play important roles in spatial learning. Partial denervation caused a homeostatic strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission in dentate granule cells (GC), in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and their direct synaptic connections as revealed by paired recordings (GC-to-CA3). These functional changes were accompanied by ultrastructural reorganization of mossy fiber synapses, which regularly contain the plasticity-related protein synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle. We demonstrate that the spine apparatus organelle and its associated protein synaptopodin assemble ribosomes in close proximity to synaptic sites and moreover we unravel synaptopodin-related transcriptome, which can be linked to the expression of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Notably, synaptopodin-deficient tissue preparations that lack the spine apparatus organelle, failed to express homeostatic adjustments of both excitatory neurotransmission and the region-specific transcriptome. Hence, synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle form local protein synthesis hubs that are essential for mediating lesion-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain signatures of chronic gut inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Gut inflammation is thought to modify brain activity and behaviour via modulation of the gut-brain axis. However, how relapsing and remitting exposure to peripheral inflammation over the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) contributes to altered brain dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to characterise changes in spontaneous spatiotemporal brain states in Crohns Disease (CD) (n = 40) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) (n = 30), compared to healthy individuals (n = 28). We first provide evidence of a significantly perturbed and heterogeneous microbial profile in CD, consistent with previous work showing enduring and long-standing dysbiosis in clinical remission. Results from our brain state assessment show that CD and UC exhibit alterations in the temporal properties of states implicating default-mode network, parietal, and visual regions, reflecting a shift in the predominance from externally to internally-oriented attentional modes. We investigated these dynamics at a finer sub-network resolution, showing a CD-specific and highly selective enhancement of connectivity between the insula and mPFC, regions implicated in cognitive-interoceptive appraisal mechanisms. Alongside overall higher anxiety scores in CD, we also provide preliminary support to suggest that the strength of chronic interoceptive hyper-signalling in the brain co-occurs with disease duration. Together, our results demonstrate that a long-standing diagnosis of CD is, in itself, a key factor in determining the risk of developing altered brain network signatures.

	<p>Migraine, as the seventh most disabling neurological disease with 26.9% prevalence in Saudi females, lacks studies on identifying associated genes and pathways with migraines in the Arab population. This case control study aims to identify the migraine-associated novel genes and risk variants. More than 1900 Arab ancestry young female college students were screened: 103 fulfilled the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine and 20 cases confirmed in the neurology clinic were included for the study with age-matched healthy controls. DNA from blood samples were subjected to paired-end whole-exome sequencing. After quality control, 3365343 missense, frameshift, missense splice region variants and insertion&amp;amp;ndash;deletion (indels) polymorphisms were tested for association with migraine. Significant variants were validated using Sanger sequencing. A total of 17 (p-value 9.091 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;05) functional variants in 12 genes (RETNLB, SCAI, ADH4, ESPL1, CPT2, FLG, PPP4R1, SERPINB5, ZNF66, ETAA1, EXO1 and CPA6) were associated with higher migraine risk, including a stop-gained frameshift (-13-14*SX) variant in the gene RETNLB (rs5851607; p-value 3.446 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;06). Gene analysis revealed that half of the significant novel migraine risk genes were expressed in the temporal lobe (p-value 0.0058) of the cerebral cortex. This is the first study exploring the migraine risk of 17 functional variants in 12 genes among Saudi female migraineurs of Arab ancestry using whole-exome sequencing. Half of the significant genes were expressed in the temporal lobe, which expands migraine pathophysiology and early identification using biomarkers for research possibilities on personalised genetics.</p>

	<p>Angiogenic factors play an important role in protecting, repairing, and reconstructing vessels after ischemic stroke. In the brains of transient focal cerebral ischemic mice, we observed a reduction in infarct volume after the administration of Angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2), but whether this process is promoted by Angpt2-induced angiogenesis has not been fully elaborated. Therefore, this study explored the angiogenic activities, in reference to CD34 which is a marker of activated ECs and blood vessels, of cultured ECs in vitro and in ischemic damaged cerebral area in mice following Angpt2 administration. Our results demonstrate that Angpt2 administration (100 ng/mL) is neuroprotective by significantly increasing the CD34 expression in in vitro-cultured ECs, reducing the infarct volume and mitigating neuronal loss, as well as enhancing CD34+ vascular length and area. In conclusion, these results indicate that Angpt2 promotes repair and attenuates ischemic injury, and that the mechanism of this is closely associated with angiogenesis in the brain after stroke.</p>

	<p>ASD consists of a set of permanent neurodevelopmental conditions, which are studded with social and communication differences, limited interests, and repetitive behaviors. Individuals with ASD have difficulty reading eye gestures and expressions, and may also have stereotyped or repetitive language, excessive adherence to routines, fixed interests, and rigid thinking. However, sexuality in adolescents and young adults with ASD is still a poorly studied and neglected issue. This review aims to evaluate sexual function and behavior in individuals with ASD to foster a greater understanding of this important, although often overlooked, issue. This review was conducted by searching peer-reviewed articles published between 01 June 2000 and 31 May 2022 using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, and Web of Science. A comprehensive search was conducted using the terms: &amp;amp;ldquo;Autism&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;ASD&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;Sexuality&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;Romantic relation&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;sexual behavior&amp;amp;rdquo; AND/OR &amp;amp;ldquo;sexual awareness&amp;amp;rdquo;. After an accurate revision of 214 full manuscripts, 11 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review found that, although individuals with ASD may have sexual functioning, their sexuality is characterized by higher prevalence rates of gender dysphoria and inappropriate sexual behavior. Furthermore, sexual awareness is reduced in this patient population, and the prevalence of other variants of sexual orientation (i.e., homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality, etc.) is higher in adolescents with ASD than in non-autistic peers. Sexual health and education should be included in the care path of patients with ASD in order to improve their quality of life and avoid/reduce inappropriate and risky behaviors.</p>

	<p>Glioblastomas are incurable primary brain tumors harboring a heterogeneous landscape of genetic and metabolic alterations. Longitudinal imaging by MRI and [18F]FET-PET measurements enable us to visualize the features of evolving tumors in a dynamic manner. Yet, close-meshed longitudinal imaging time points for characterizing temporal and spatial metabolic alterations during tumor evolution in patients is not feasible because patients usually present with already established tumors. The replication-competent avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (RCAS)/tumor virus receptor-A (tva) system is a powerful preclinical glioma model offering a high grade of spatial and temporal control of somatic gene delivery in vivo. Consequently, here, we aimed at using MRI and [18F]FET-PET to identify typical neuroimaging characteristics of the platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB)-driven glioma model using the RCAS-tva system. Our study showed that this preclinical glioma model displays MRI and [18F]FET-PET features that highly resemble the corresponding established human disease, emphasizing the high translational relevance of this experimental model. Furthermore, our investigations unravel exponential growth dynamics and a model-specific tumor microenvironment, as assessed by histology and immunochemistry. Taken together, our study provides further insights into this preclinical model and advocates for the imaging-stratified design of preclinical therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>In recent years, there has been a growing body of literature highlighting the relationship between presbycusis and consequences in areas other than hearing. In particular, presbycusis is linked to depression, dementia, and cognitive decline. Among this literature, the effect of hearing aids, currently the most common method of treating presbycusis, is also a growing research topic. This pilot study aims to explore the effects of hearing aids on the cognitive and multisensory consequences of presbycusis. To that purpose, saccades and vergences eye movements were studied, towards visual and audiovisual targets, of a presbycusis population wearing hearing aids for an average of two years. These measurements were done whether or not participants were wearing their hearing aids. Eye-movement characteristics, particularly latencies (the reaction time taken to initiate an eye movement), allows one to measure attentional and multisensory characteristics. Previous studies showed that presbycusis was linked with an increase of saccade latencies and an improvement in audiovisual interaction capacities, i.e., latencies for audiovisual targets are shorter than those for visual targets. Eye movements are measured and analyzed with REMOBI and AIDEAL technologies. Results show a shortening, with hearing aids, of right saccade latencies to visual targets, suggesting an increase in attention and/or engagement. Yet, saccade latencies are not shorter for audiovisual vs. visual targets alone, neither when wearing hearing aids, nor without. Moreover, convergence latencies are particularly slow for any type of target and with or without hearing aids. The results suggest deficits for audiovisual interactions and the initiation of convergences in that population. These deficits could be part of the factors triggering the need to wear hearing aids. These results therefore show interesting relationships between hearing-aid wearing in a presbycusis population and oculomotricity and invite further research in this area.</p>

<p>The main objective of this work was to obtain detailed information on the distribution and localization of the spexin (Spx) system in the sea bass brain. To this purpose, we first identified and characterized the <i>spx1</i> gene and analyzed its expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of the European sea bass by using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Then, we mapped the Spx1 system by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against mammalian SPX, and finally we determined its interaction with other reproductive-related neuroendocrine systems by using double immunohistochemistry and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih), prepro-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh1), -(Gnrh2) and -(Gnrh3) antisera. The results obtained suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spexin (Spx) is a recently characterized neuropeptide implicated in multiple physiological processes in vertebrates, including reproduction, food intake, and regulation of anxiety and stress. Two orthologs (Spx1 and Spx2) are present in some nonmammalian vertebrates, including teleosts. However, information on the distribution of Spx in the brain and its interactions with other neuroendocrine systems in fish is still scarce. In this work, we cloned and sequenced the sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) Spx1, which included a 27 aa signal peptide and a mature peptide of 14 aa that is C-terminal amidated. <i>spx1</i> transcripts were higher in the diencephalon/caudal preoptic area/hypothalamus and medulla but were also detected in the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon/rostral preoptic area, optic tectum/tegmentum, cerebellum/pons, and pituitary. The immunohistochemical study revealed Spx1-immunoreactive (ir) cells in different nuclei of the preoptic area, habenula, prethalamus, mesencephalic tegmentum and in the proximal <i>pars distalis</i> (PPD) and <i>pars intermedia</i> of the pituitary. Spx1-ir fibers were widely distributed throughout the brain being particularly abundant in the midbrain and hindbrain, in close contact with tegmental gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) cells and isthmic gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih) cells of the secondary gustatory nucleus. Moreover, Gnih fibers were observed innervating Spx1-ir cells lying in several subdivisions of the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and in the lateral nucleus of the valvula, whereas ventrolateral prethalamic Spx1-ir cells received immunopositive Gnrh2 fibers. In the pituitary, Gnrh1-ir fibers were observed closely associated with Spx1-ir cells of the PPD. These results suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.</p>

                Sensory difficulties represent a crucial issue in the life of autistic individuals. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders describes both hyper- and hypo-responsiveness to sensory stimulation as a criterion for the diagnosis autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Among the sensory domain affected in ASD, altered responses to tactile stimulation represent the most commonly reported sensory deficits. Although tactile abnormalities have been reported in monogenic cohorts of patients and genetic mouse models of ASD, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Traditionally, autism research has focused on the central nervous system as the target to infer the neurobiological bases of such tactile abnormalities. Nonetheless, the peripheral nervous system represents the initial site of processing of sensory information and a potential site of dysfunction in the sensory cascade. Here we investigated the gene expression deregulation in the trigeminal ganglion (which directly receives tactile information from whiskers) in two genetic models of syndromic autism (Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice) at both adult and juvenile ages. We found several neuronal and non-neuronal markers involved in inhibitory, excitatory, neuroinflammatory and sensory neurotransmission to be differentially regulated within the trigeminal ganglia of both adult and juvenile Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice. These results may help in entangling the multifaced complexity of sensory abnormalities in autism and open avenues for the development of peripherally targeted treatments for tactile sensory deficits exhibited in ASD.

	<p>A specific interpretation of embodiment assigns a central role to the body representations (BR) in cognition. In the social cognition domain, BR could be pivotal in representing others&amp;amp;rsquo; actions and states. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between different BR and social cognition, in terms of Theory of Mind (ToM), in the same sample of participants is missing. Here, this relationship was explored considering individual differences in the action-oriented BR (aBR), nonaction-oriented BR (NaBR), and subjective predisposition toward internal bodily sensations (interoceptive sensibility, ISe). Eighty-two healthy adults were given behavioral measures probing aBR, NaBR, ISe, and affective/cognitive ToM. The results suggest that NaBR, which mainly relies on exteroceptive signals, predicts individual differences in cognitive ToM, possibly because it can allow differentiating between the self and others. Instead, the negative association between affective ToM and ISe suggests that an alteration of the internal body state representation (i.e., over-reporting interoceptive sensations) can affect emotional processing in social contexts. The finding that distinct aspects of the body processing from within (ISe) and from the outside (NaBR) differently contribute to ToM provides empirical support to the BR role in social cognition and can be relevant for developing interventions in clinical settings.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Apart from Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), no biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of dementia have been established to date. Inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia subtypes, e.g., AD or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In the context of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, white blood cell (WBC) populations and platelet counts, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), have emerged as biomarkers. Their clinical relevance in dementia, however, is currently only insufficiently investigated. In the present study, hematological and inflammatory parameters were measured in the peripheral blood of 97 patients admitted to the gerontopsychiatric ward of Hannover Medical School, a university hospital in Germany, for dementia assessment. The study population comprised 20 non-demented, depressed patients (control group) and 77 demented patients who were assigned to five different groups based on their underlying dementia etiology: AD, n = 33; vascular dementia, n = 12; mixed dementia, n = 21; FTD, n = 5; and Korsakoff syndrome, n = 6. We observed neither statistically significant differences regarding total WBC populations, platelet counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, nor CRP levels between the control group and the five dementia groups. CRP levels tended to be higher in patients with Korsakoff syndrome than in the control group and in AD patients. Thus, CRP could possibly play a role in the differential diagnosis of dementia. This should be investigated further in future prospective studies with larger sample sizes. WBC and platelet counts, by contrast, do not appear to be suitable biomarkers in the differential diagnosis of dementia.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks cause intracranial hypotension (SIH) and also may cause infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) but the rate of development among different CSF leak types and outcome of treatment are not known. We determined the time interval from SIH onset to iSS and the outcome of treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,589 patients with SIH underwent neuroimaging and iSS was detected in 57 (23 men and 34 women, mean age¬†=¬†41.3‚Äâyears [3.6%]). We examined the type of underlying CSF leak by various imaging modalities. Percutaneous and surgical procedures were used to treat the CSF leaks.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The iSS was detected in 46 (10.3%) of 447 patients with ventral CSF leaks, in 2 (3.9%) of 51 patients with dural ectasia, in 5 (2.6%) of 194 patients with CSF-venous fistulas, in 4 (0.9%) of 457 patients with simple meningeal diverticula, and in none of the 101 patients with lateral CSF leaks or the 339 patients with leaks of indeterminate origin (<i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001). The estimated median latency period from SIH onset to iSS was 126¬†months. Ventral CSF leaks could not be eliminated with percutaneous procedures in any patient and surgical repair was associated with low risk (&lt;5%) and resulted in resolution of the CSF leak in all patients in whom the exact site of the CSF leak could be determined. Other types of CSF leak were treated with percutaneous or surgical procedures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The iSS can develop in most types of spinal CSF leak, including CSF-venous fistulas, but mainly in chronic ventral CSF leaks, which require surgical repair. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore longitudinal changes in brain volumetric measures and retinal layer thicknesses following acute optic neuritis (AON) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), to investigate the process of trans-synaptic degeneration, and determine its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PwMS were recruited within 40‚Äâdays of AON onset (n¬†=¬†49), and underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging followed by longitudinal tracking for up to 5‚Äâyears. A comparator cohort of PwMS without a recent episode of AON were similarly tracked (n¬†=¬†73). Mixed-effects linear regression models were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accelerated atrophy of the occipital gray matter (GM), calcarine GM, and thalamus was seen in the AON cohort, as compared with the non-AON cohort (‚àí0.76% vs ‚àí0.22% per year [<i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.01] for occipital GM, ‚àí1.83% vs ‚àí0.32% per year [<i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.008] for calcarine GM, ‚àí1.17% vs ‚àí0.67% per year [<i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.02] for thalamus), whereas rates of whole-brain, cortical GM, non-occipital cortical GM atrophy, and T2 lesion accumulation did not differ significantly between the cohorts. In the AON cohort, greater AON-induced reduction in ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thickness over the first year was associated with faster rates of whole-brain (r¬†=¬†0.32, <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.04), white matter (r¬†=¬†0.32, <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.04), and thalamic (r¬†=¬†0.36, <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.02) atrophy over the study period. Significant relationships were identified between faster atrophy of the subcortical GM and thalamus, with worse visual function outcomes after AON.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide <i>in-vivo</i> evidence for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration following AON in PwMS, and suggest that trans-synaptic degeneration may be related to clinically-relevant visual outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Elevated Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 181 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) is reliably elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less explored is its specificity relative to other neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we find novel evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative condition typically lacking tau pathology. We performed a detailed evaluation to identify the clinical correlates of elevated p-tau<sub>181</sub> in ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were clinically or pathologically diagnosed with ALS (n¬†=¬†130) or AD (n¬†=¬†79), or were healthy non-impaired controls (n¬†=¬†26). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed and area under the curve (AUC) was used to discriminate AD from ALS. Within ALS, Mann‚ÄìWhitney‚ÄìWilcoxon tests compared analytes by presence/absence of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs. Spearman correlations tested associations between plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> and postmortem neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A Wilcoxon test showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was higher in ALS than controls (<i>W</i>¬†=¬†2,600, <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.000015), and ROC analyses showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> poorly discriminated AD and ALS (AUC¬†=¬†0.60). In ALS, elevated plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with LMN signs in cervical (<i>W</i>¬†=¬†827, <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.0072), thoracic (<i>W</i>¬†=¬†469, <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.00025), and lumbosacral regions (<i>W</i>¬†=¬†851, <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.0000029). In support of LMN findings, plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with neuron loss in the spinal cord (rho¬†=¬†0.46, <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.017), but not in the motor cortex (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.41). Cerebrospinal spinal fluid p-tau<sub>181</sub> and plasma neurofilament light chain were included as reference analytes, and demonstrate specificity of findings.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found strong evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in ALS and may be a novel marker specific to LMN dysfunction. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:807‚Äì818</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau Mediates Synergistic Influence of Vascular Risk and AŒ≤ on Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and beta-amyloid (AŒ≤) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-AŒ≤ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ8.0‚Äâyears). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline AŒ≤ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography (PET). Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.5‚Äâyears) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.0‚Äâyears) using the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and AŒ≤ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*AŒ≤ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and AŒ≤ on greater ITC tau accumulation (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.004), even in individuals with AŒ≤ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with AŒ≤ on longitudinal tau (both <i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and AŒ≤ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of AŒ≤ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate AŒ≤-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Effects of Brain Lesions Causing Central Poststroke Pain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to test whether lesions causing central poststroke pain (CPSP) are associated with a specific connectivity profile, whether these connections are associated with metabolic changes, and whether this network aligns with neuromodulation targets for pain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two independent lesion datasets were utilized: (1) subcortical lesions from published case reports and (2) thalamic lesions with metabolic imaging using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography‚Äìcomputed tomography. Functional connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was assessed using a normative connectome (n¬†=¬†1,000), and connections specific to CPSP were identified. Metabolic changes specific to CPSP were also identified and related to differences in lesion connectivity. Therapeutic relevance of the network was explored by testing for alignment with existing brain stimulation data and by prospectively targeting the network with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 7 patients with CPSP.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lesion locations causing CPSP showed a specific pattern of brain connectivity that was consistent across two independent lesion datasets (spatial <i>r</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.82, <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). Connectivity differences were correlated with postlesion metabolism (<i>r</i>¬†=‚Äâ‚àí0.48, <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001). The topography of this lesion-based pain network aligned with variability in pain improvement across 12 prior neuromodulation targets and across 32 patients who received rTMS to primary motor cortex (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.05). Prospectively targeting this network with rTMS improved CPSP in 6 of 7 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lesions causing pain are connected to a specific brain network that shows metabolic abnormalities and promise as a neuromodulation target. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:834‚Äì845</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Brain Connectivity Predicts Chronic Pain in Acute Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Previous studies have established the role of the cortico-mesolimbic and descending pain modulation systems in chronic pain prediction. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an acute pain model where chronic pain is prevalent and complicated for prediction. In this study, we set out to study whether functional connectivity (FC) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is predictive of pain chronification in early-acute mTBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To estimate FC, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 105 participants with mTBI following a motor vehicle collision was acquired within 72‚Äâhours post-accident. Participants were classified according to pain ratings provided at 12-months post-collision into chronic pain (head/neck pain ‚â•30/100, n¬†=¬†44) and recovery (n¬†=¬†61) groups, and their FC maps were compared.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The chronic pain group exhibited reduced negative FC between NAc and a region within the primary motor cortex corresponding with the expected representation of the area of injury. A complementary pattern was also demonstrated between PAG and the primary somatosensory cortex. PAG and NAc also shared increased FC to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) within the recovery group. Brain connectivity further shows high classification accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]¬†=¬†.86) for future chronic pain, when combined with an acute pain intensity report.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FC features obtained shortly after mTBI predict its transition to long-term chronic pain, and may reflect an underlying interaction of injury-related primary sensorimotor cortical areas with the mesolimbic and pain modulation systems. Our findings indicate a potential predictive biomarker and highlight targets for future early preventive interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:819‚Äì833</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition in which genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to its etiology. Remarkable progress has been made in deciphering disease etiology through genetic approaches, but there is limited data about how environmental and genetic factors interact to modify penetrance, risk, and disease severity. Here, we provide insights into environmental modifiers of PD, discussing precedents from other neurological and non-neurological conditions. Based on these examples, we outline genetic and environmental factors contributing to PD and review potential environmental modifiers of penetrance and clinical variability in monogenic and idiopathic PD. We also highlight the potential challenges and propose how future studies might tackle these important questions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:715‚Äì724</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Microglial Activation and Connectivity in Alzheimer Disease and Aging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid Œ≤ (AŒ≤) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, but increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation also plays a key role, driven by the activation of microglia. AŒ≤ and tau pathology appear to spread along pathways of highly connected brain regions, but it remains elusive whether microglial activation follows a similar distribution pattern. Here, we assess whether connectivity is associated with microglia activation patterns.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 32 AŒ≤-positive early AD subjects (18 women, 14 men) and 18 AŒ≤-negative age-matched healthy controls (10 women, 8 men) from the prospective ActiGliA (Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease) study. All participants underwent microglial activation positron emission tomography (PET) with the third-generation mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure resting-state functional and structural connectivity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that inter-regional covariance in TSPO-PET and standardized uptake value ratio was preferentially distributed along functionally highly connected brain regions, with MRI structural connectivity showing a weaker association with microglial activation. AD patients showed increased TSPO-PET tracer uptake bilaterally in the anterior medial temporal lobe compared to controls, and higher TSPO-PET uptake was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia severity in a disease stage-dependent manner.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Microglial activation distributes preferentially along highly connected brain regions, similar to tau pathology. These findings support the important role of microglia in neurodegeneration, and we speculate that pathology spreads throughout the brain along vulnerable connectivity pathways.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Reactivation of HERV-K(HML-2) has been found in subsets of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study examines the antibody response against HML-2 in ALS and analyzes its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Antibodies to HML-2 envelope (env) were analyzed using a peptide array for epitope mapping and by a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 242 healthy donors, and 243 ALS and 85 multiple sclerosis (MS) individuals. Extracellular levels of HML-2 were analyzed by digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Antibodies in the sera of ALS individuals recognized more HML-2 env peptides compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). ALS individuals had higher levels of HML-2 than healthy donors (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.02) and higher antibody levels against a select HML-2 env peptide compared to healthy donors or individuals with multiple sclerosis (<i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). 55.14% of ALS compared to 21.16% of healthy donors and 13.10% of MS individuals had antibodies against the HML-2 peptide (AUC¬†=¬†0.769, <i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). Levels of extracellular HML-2 DNA in serum (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.02) and the number of HML-2 env peptides recognized by ALS sera (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.02) correlated with disease duration. Among ALS individuals, lower levels of HML-2 antibodies were associated with a definite diagnosis per EL Escorial criteria (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.03), and with a lower predicted (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.02) and observed survival (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.03).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a differential antibody response against specific epitopes of HML-2 env in ALS and controls, suggesting epitope spreading, likely due to persistent antigenic exposure following reactivation of the viral genes. Low levels of antibodies to HML-2 env in ALS are associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival probability. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:782‚Äì792</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative neurological disorder with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the potential biomarkers implicated in the occurrence and progression of AD prior to clinical testing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We selected 119 unique blood metabolites from 3 metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 147,827 European participants. Summary data about AD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis with 63,926 European individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of blood metabolites with AD, and a phenome-wide MR analysis was further applied to ascertain the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four metabolites were identified as causal mediators for AD, including epiandrosterone sulfate (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51‚Äì0.71; <i>p</i>¬†=¬†6.14‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí9</sup>), 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate (OR per SD increase: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57‚Äì0.84; <i>p</i>¬†=¬†1.98‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí4</sup>), sphingomyelin (OR per SD increase: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78‚Äì3.59; <i>p</i>¬†=¬†2.10‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí7</sup>), and glutamine (OR per SD increase: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77‚Äì0.89; <i>p</i>¬†=¬†2.09‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>‚àí6</sup>). Phenome-wide MR analysis showed that epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate and sphingomyelin mediated the risk of multiple diseases, and glutamine had beneficial effects on the risk of 4 diseases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted increased epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate, and glutamine might be associated with a decreased risk of AD, while sphingomyelin was associated with an increased risk.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Dystrophinopathy Phenotypes and Modifying Factors in DMD Exon 45‚Äì55 Deletion</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon 45‚Äì55 deletion (del45‚Äì55) has been postulated as a model that could treat up to 60% of DMD patients, but the associated clinical variability and complications require clarification. We aimed to understand the phenotypes and potential modifying factors of this dystrophinopathy subset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study applied clinical and functional evaluation. Next generation sequencing was employed to identify intronic breakpoints and their impact on the <i>Dp140</i> promotor, intronic long noncoding RNA, and regulatory splicing sequences. DMD modifiers (<i>SPP1, LTBP4, ACTN3</i>) and concomitant mutations were also assessed. Haplotypes were built using <i>DMD</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms. Dystrophin expression was evaluated via immunostaining, Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and droplet digital PCR in 9 muscle biopsies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The series comprised 57 subjects (23 index) expressing Becker phenotype (28%), isolated cardiopathy (19%), and asymptomatic features (53%). Cognitive impairment occurred in 90% of children. Patients were classified according to 10 distinct index-case breakpoints; 4 of them were recurrent due to founder events. A specific breakpoint (D5) was associated with severity, but no significant effect was appreciated due to the changes in intronic sequences. All biopsies showed dystrophin expression of &gt;67% and traces of alternative del45‚Äì57 transcript that were not deemed pathogenically relevant. Only the <i>LTBP4</i> haplotype appeared associated the presence of cardiopathy among the explored extragenic factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We confirmed that del45‚Äì55 segregates a high proportion of benign phenotypes, severe cases, and isolated cardiac and cognitive presentations. Although some influence of the intronic breakpoint position and the <i>LTBP4</i> modifier may exist, the pathomechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variability remain largely unresolved.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Salivary CGRP and Erenumab Treatment Response: Towards Precision Medicine in Migraine</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed (1) to analyze salivary calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in patients with migraine, (2) to predict erenumab response from baseline CGRP levels, and (3) to evaluate CGRP change post-treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective observational study that measured salivary CGRP levels in healthy controls (HCs), patients with episodic migraine (EM) and patients with chronic migraine (CM). Participants collected saliva samples at baseline and, the patients who were candidates to receive erenumab, also collected saliva after 3 doses of treatment. We quantified CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and we performed an analysis at baseline and post-treatment through generalized linear mixed models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, a higher headache frequency was associated with higher CGRP levels, those being even higher in the presence of depressive symptoms. A cutoff point (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 103.93 (95% CI¬†=¬†103.35‚Äì104.51) pg/ml was estimated to differentiate migraine from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC, 95% CI) of 0.801 (95% CI¬†=¬†0.798‚Äì0.804). We also found that higher pretreatment salivary CGRP levels were statistically significantly associated to a higher probability of having 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency in patients with EM, but not in patients with CM. After 12‚Äâweeks of treatment with erenumab, salivary CGRP levels from patients within all spectrum of migraine frequency converged to similar CGRP values. In contrast, in patients with concomitant depressive symptoms, this convergence did not happen.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with migraine not only have higher CGRP levels compared with HCs, but also the presence of depressive symptoms seems to increase salivary CGRP levels and we have evidence, for the first time, that baseline salivary CGRP concentration is associated with treatment response to erenumab.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether adjunct alteplase improves brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 36 patients (mean [standard deviation]¬†=¬†70.8 [13.5] years old, 18 [50%] women) with large vessel occlusion undergoing thrombectomy resulting in near-normal (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] b50/67/2c, n¬†=¬†23, 64%) or normal angiographic reperfusion (eTICI 3, n¬†=¬†13, 36%). Seventeen patients were randomized to intra-arterial alteplase (0.225mg/kg), and 19 received placebo. At 48‚Äâhours, patients had brain perfusion/diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-spectroscopy. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of patients with areas of hypoperfusion on MRI. Secondary outcomes were the infarct expansion ratio (final to initial infarction volume), and the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak relative to total creatine as a marker of neuronal integrity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The prevalence of hypoperfusion was 24% with intra-arterial alteplase, and 58% with placebo (adjusted odds ratio¬†=¬†0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]¬†=¬†0.04‚Äì0.91, <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.03). Among 14 patients with final eTICI 3 scores, hypoperfusion was found in 1 of 7 (14%) in the alteplase group and 3 of 7 (43%) in the placebo group. Abnormal brain perfusion was associated with worse functional outcome at day 90. Alteplase significantly reduced the infarct expansion ratio compared with placebo (median [interquartile range (IQR)]¬†=¬†0.7 [0.5‚Äì1.2] vs 3.2 [1.8‚Äì5.7], <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.01) and resulted in higher NAA peaks (median [IQR]¬†=¬†1.13 [0.91‚Äì1.36] vs 1.00 [0.74‚Äì1.22], <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a high prevalence of areas of hypoperfusion following thrombectomy despite successful reperfusion on angiography. Adjunct alteplase enhances brain reperfusion, which results in reduced expansion of the infarction and improved neuronal integrity. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:860‚Äì870</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">5‚ÄêYear Associations among Cerebral Arterial Pulsatility, Perivascular Space Dilation, and White Matter Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High cerebral arterial pulsatility index (PI), white matter lesions (WMLs), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVSs), and lacunar infarcts are common findings in the elderly population, and considered indicators of small vessel disease (SVD). Here, we investigate the potential temporal ordering among these variables, with emphasis on determining whether high PI is an early or delayed manifestation of SVD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a population-based cohort, 4D flow MRI data for cerebral arterial pulsatility was collected for 159 participants at baseline (age 64‚Äì68), and for 122 participants at follow-up 5‚Äâyears later. Structural MRI was used for WML and PVS segmentation, and lacune identification. Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were used to model longitudinal changes testing for pairwise associations, and latent change score (LCS) models to model multiple relationships among variables simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Longitudinal 5-year increases were found for WML, PVS, and PI. Cerebral arterial PI at baseline did not predict changes in WML or PVS volume. However, WML and PVS volume at baseline predicted 5-year increases in PI. This was shown for PI increases in relation to baseline WML and PVS volumes using LME models (R¬†‚â•¬†0.24; <i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.02 and R¬†‚â•¬†0.23; <i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.03, respectively) and LCS models (Œ≤¬†=¬†0.28; <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.015 and Œ≤¬†=¬†0.28; <i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.009, respectively). Lacunes at baseline were unrelated to PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In healthy older adults, indicators of SVD are related in a lead‚Äìlag fashion, in which the expression of WML and PVS precedes increases in cerebral arterial PI. Hence, we propose that elevated PI is a relatively late manifestation, rather than a risk factor, for cerebral SVD. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:871‚Äì881</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether ‚Äädifferential phosphorylation states of blood markers can identify patients with LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed phospho(P)-Ser-935-LRRK2 and P-Ser-473-AKT levels in peripheral blood cells from patients with G2019S <i>LRRK2</i>-associated PD (L2PD, n¬†=¬†31), G2019S <i>LRRK2</i> non-manifesting carriers (L2NMC, n¬†=¬†26), idiopathic PD (iPD, n¬†=¬†25), and controls (n¬†=¬†40, total n¬†=¬†122). We found no differences at P-Ser-935-LRRK2 between groups but detected a specific increase of P-Ser-473-AKT levels in all G2019S carriers, either L2PD or L2NMC, absent in iPD. Although insensitive to LRRK2 inhibition, our study identifies P-Ser-473-AKT as an endogenous candidate biomarker for peripheral inflammation in G2019S carriers using accessible blood cells.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite a 90% reperfusion rate, only 50% of patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion-related acute ischemic stroke (LVO-AIS) have a functional recovery at 3‚Äâmonths. Parenchymal hematoma (PH) is a predictor of poor outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT). We aim to investigate the relationship between the delay from onset to reperfusion, the occurrence of PH, and functional outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing prospective observational study. Data were analyzed from the subgroup of patients who underwent a successful EVT defined by a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score 2b-3. We assessed the factors associated with PH, (ie, PH1 or PH2 grade according to the European Collaborative Acute Stroke Study 2 (ECASS) classification of hemorrhagic transformation), then evaluated the relationships between PH, delay from onset to reperfusion, and functional recovery defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0‚Äì2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed 2,919 patients with an LVO-related AIS who underwent a successful EVT. Overall, 13.3% of the participant experienced a PH. The rate of PH increased by 2.5% (95% CI 1.5%‚Äì3.6%, <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001) for every additional hour of onset to reperfusion delay and was, by comparison with the other study patients, consistently associated with a lower rate of functional recovery 19.7% (95% CI 11.6%‚Äì27.7%, <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001) irrespective of time from onset to reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that PH rate is associated with the delay from onset to reperfusion and participates in the relationship between time to reperfusion and outcome. Time is Bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:882‚Äì887</p>

                <p>The first case of paralytic poliomyelitis in nearly a decade in the US was discovered in a 20-year-old unvaccinated man from Rockland County, New York, in July 2022, who developed acute flaccid myelitis. The isolated virus from stool sampling was found to be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type¬†2, derived from the oral polio vaccine. Since the discovery of this case, local wastewater surveillance has revealed evidence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type¬†2 in local counties, as well as in New York City, representing community transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, routine vaccination administration has declined globally, with increasing numbers of communities not vaccinated for poliovirus. Now, with evidence of local community transmission, the clinical implication for at-risk unvaccinated individuals is significant. Here, we review the epidemiological origin of this discovered strain of poliovirus, national and international methods of surveillance for poliovirus, and neurological features of poliovirus. We also highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in monitoring suspected cases, as well as the unique role neurologists might play in national and global poliomyelitis surveillance.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n¬†=¬†52), solanezumab IV (n¬†=¬†50), or placebo (n¬†=¬†40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating¬Æ (CDR¬Æ), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, Œ≤-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR]¬†=¬†9.1, confidence interval [CI][1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-…õ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR¬†=¬†5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR¬†=¬†13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225‚Äâmg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675‚Äâmg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR‚Äâ&gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225‚Äâmg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-…õ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:729‚Äì744</p>

     alt="Mimicking partial to total placental insufficiency in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>A new model of Partial+Full uterine ischemia mimicking the transition from partial to total placental abruption in humans was developed in rabbits. Similar neurobehavioral deficits but worse cell viability <i>ex vivo</i> were found in the new Partial+Full uterine ischemia model compared to the previous Full uterine ischemia model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>All placental abruptions begin as partial abruptions, which sometimes manifest as fetal bradycardia. The progression from partial to total abruption was mimicked by a new rabbit model of placental insufficiency, and we compared it, with sufficient statistical power, with the previous model mimicking total placental abruption. The previous model uses total uterine ischemia at E22 or E25 (70% or 79% term, respectively), in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits for 40¬†min (Full H-I). The new model, Partial+Full H-I, added a 30-min partial ischemia before the 40-min total ischemia. Fetuses were delivered either at E31.5 (full term) vaginally for neurobehavior testing, or by C-section at E25 for <i>ex vivo</i> brain cell viability evaluation. The onset of fetal bradycardia was within the first 2¬†min of either H-I protocol. There was no difference between Full H-I (<i>n</i>¬†=¬†442 for E22, 312 for E25) and Partial+Full H-I (<i>n</i>¬†=¬†154 and 80) groups in death or severely affected kits at E22 (76% vs. 79%) or at E25 (66% vs. 64%), or normal kits at E22 or E25, or any of the individual newborn neurobehavioral tests at any age. No sex differences were found. Partial+Full H-I (<i>n</i>¬†=¬†6) showed less cell viability than Full H-I (<i>n</i>¬†=¬†8) at 72-hr <i>ex vivo</i> in the brain regions studied. Partial+Full H-I insult produced similar cerebral palsy phenotype as our previous Full H-I model in a sufficiently powered study and may be more suitable for testing of potential neuroprotectants.</p>

     alt="How lung injury and therapeutic oxygen could alter white matter development"/>
<p>Here we review the literature to shed light on the possibility that high oxygen levels and/or lung injury, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, can lead to neurodevelopmental impairment. The literature is especially convincing that these factors affect the neurodevelopment of extremely preterm or very low birth weight infants. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental brain injury describes a spectrum of neurological pathologies resulting from either antenatal or perinatal injury. This includes both cognitive and motor defects that affect patients for their entire lives. Developmental brain injury can be caused by a spectrum of conditions including stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, and intracranial hemorrhage. Additional risk factors have been identified including very low birth weight, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) supplementation. In fact, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, an inflammatory disease associated with disrupted lung development, have been shown to have decreased cerebral white matter and decreased intracranial volumes. Thus, there appears to be a developmental link between the lung, O<sub>2</sub>, and the brain that leads to proper myelination. Here, we will discuss what is currently known about the link between O<sub>2</sub> and myelination and how scientists are exploring mechanisms through which supplemental O<sub>2</sub> and/or lung injury can affect brain development. Consideration of a link between the diseased lung and developing brain will allow clinicians to fine tune their approaches in managing preterm lung disease in order to optimize brain health.</p>

<p>In a transient systemic hypoxic-ischemic model of placental insufficiency, erythropoietin is found to have lasting, mitigating effects on the diminished cognitive flexibility and increased perseveration which are associated with encephalopathy of prematurity. Highly translatable testing, including novel object recognition and touchscreen-based visual discrimination and reversal learning, reveal significant differences post-treatment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Preterm birth is a principal cause of neurological disability later in life, including cognitive and behavioral deficits. Notably, cognitive impairment has greater impact on quality of life than physical disability. Survivors of preterm birth commonly have deficits of executive function. Difficulties with tasks and planning complexity correlate positively with increasing disability. To overcome these barriers for children born preterm, preclinical and clinical studies have emphasized the importance of neurorestoration. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a endogenous cytokine with multiple beneficial mechanisms of action following perinatal brain injury. While most preclinical investigations have focused on pathology and molecular mechanisms, translational studies of repair using clinically viable biobehavioral biomarkers are still lacking. Here, using an established model of encephalopathy of prematurity secondary to placental insufficiency, we tested the hypothesis that administration of EPO in the neonatal period would attenuate deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility in adult rats of both sexes. We assessed cognition and executive function in two ways. First, using the classic test of novel object recognition and second, using a touchscreen platform. Touchscreen testing allows for rigorous testing of cognition and executive function in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Data show that adult rats exhibit deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility following <i>in utero</i> placental insufficiency. Notably, neonatal treatment of EPO attenuates these deficits in adulthood and facilitates functional repair. Together, these data validate EPO neurorestoration using a clinically relevant outcome measure and support the concept that postnatal treatment following <i>in utero</i> injury can improve cognition and executive function through adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">A systematic review of noninflammatory cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for clinical outcome in neonates with perinatal hypoxic brain injury that could be biologically significant</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that purportedly arises from hypoxia-ischemia is labeled hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical syndrome involving acidosis, a low Apgar score and the need for resuscitation in the delivery room; asphyxia alerts one to the possibility of NE. In the present systematic review, we focused on the noninflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are involved in the development of possible brain injury in asphyxia or HIE. A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for case‚Äìcontrol studies was conducted and 17 studies were found suitable by <i>a priori</i> criteria. Statistical analysis used the Mantel‚ÄìHaenszel model for dichotomous data. The pooled mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. We identified the best biomarkers, based on the estimation approach in evaluating the biological significance, out of hundreds in three categories: cell adhesion and proliferation, oxidants and antioxidants, and cell damage. The following subtotal-population comparisons were made: perinatal asphyxia versus no asphyxia, asphyxia with HIE versus asphyxia without HIE, asphyxia with HIE versus no asphyxia, and term versus preterm HIE newborn with asphyxia. Biological significance of the biomarkers was determined by using a modification of the estimation approach, by ranking the biomarkers according to the difference in the bounds of the CIs. The most promising CSF biomarkers for prognostication especially for the severest HIE include creatine kinase, xanthine oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron-specific enolase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Future studies are recommended using such a combined test to prognosticate the most severely affected patients.</p>

<p>Insomnia is prevalent in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and heavily influences quality of life. Using a mouse model of ASD we show that sleep problems are present from young ages and worsen with time, supporting abnormal sleep as a core feature of ASD.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep problems are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), can be observed before diagnosis, and are associated with increased restricted and repetitive behaviors. Therefore, sleep abnormalities may be a core feature of the disorder, but the developmental trajectory remains unknown. Animal models provide a unique opportunity to understand sleep ontogenesis in ASD. Previously we showed that adult mice with a truncation in the high-confidence ASD gene <i>Shank3</i> (Shank3<sup>‚àÜC</sup>) recapitulate the clinical sleep phenotype. In this study we used longitudinal electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings to define, for the first time, changes in sleep from weaning to young adulthood in an ASD mouse model. We show that Shank3<sup>‚àÜC</sup> male mice sleep less overall throughout their lifespan, have increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in life despite significantly reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and have abnormal responses to increased sleep pressure that emerge during a specific developmental period. We demonstrate that the ability to fall asleep quickly in response to sleep loss develops normally between 24 and 30‚Äâdays in mice. However, mutants are unable to reduce sleep latency after periods of prolonged waking and maintain the same response to sleep loss regardless of age. This phenomenon seems independent of homeostatic NREM sleep slow-wave dynamics. Overall, our study recapitulates both preclinical models and clinical studies showing that reduced sleep is consistently associated with ASD and suggests that problems falling asleep may reflect abnormal development of sleep and arousal mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is solid evidence for the prominent involvement of the central autonomic and default mode systems in shaping personality. However, whether functional connectivity of these systems can represent neural correlates and predictors of individual variation in personality traits is largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 215 healthy young adults were used to construct the sympathetic (SN), parasympathetic (PN), and default mode (DMN) networks, with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity measured. Personality factors were assessed using the five-factor model. We examined the associations between personality factors and functional network connectivity, followed by performance of personality prediction based on functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach. All personality factors (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) other than openness were significantly correlated with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity of the SN, PN, and DMN. Moreover, the CPM models successfully predicted conscientiousness and agreeableness at the individual level using functional network connectivity. Our findings may expand existing knowledge regarding the neural substrates underlying personality.</p>

     alt="IL-12p40 promotes secondary damage and functional impairment after spinal cord contusional injury"/>
<p>IL-12p40 is acutely upregulated, specifically on astrocytes in the ventro- and dorsomedial regions of the injured cords. IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 are expressed early and chronically after SCI expanding from the ventromedial regions throughout the rest of the injured cord. <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>‚àí/‚àí</i>
</sup> mice demonstrate greater recovery and tissue sparing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secondary damage obstructs functional recovery for individuals who have sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI). Two processes significantly contributing to tissue damage after trauma are spinal cord hemorrhage and inflammation: more specifically, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, frequently driven by pro-inflammatory factors. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators capable of modulating the immune response. While cytokines are necessary to elicit inflammation for proper healing, excessive inflammation can result in destructive processes. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 are pathogenic in multiple autoimmune diseases. The cytokine subunit IL-12p40 is necessary to form bioactive IL-12 and IL-23. In this study, we examined the relationship between spinal cord hemorrhage and IL-12-related factors, as well as the impact of IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) on secondary damage and functional recovery after SCI. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and protein tissue analyses, we demonstrated a positive correlation between IL-12 and tissue hemorrhage. Receptor and ligand subunits of IL-12 were significantly upregulated after injury and colocalized with astrocytes, demonstrating a myriad of opportunities for IL-12 to induce an inflammatory response. <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>‚àí/‚àí</i>
</sup> mice demonstrated significantly improved functional recovery and reduced lesion sizes compared to wild-type mice. Targeted gene array analysis in wild-type and <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>‚àí/‚àí</i>
</sup> female mice after SCI revealed an upregulation of genes associated with worsened recovery after SCI. Taken together, our data reveal a pathogenic role of IL-12p40 in the secondary damage after SCI, hindering functional recovery. IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) is thus an enticing neuroinflammatory target for further study as a potential therapeutic target to benefit recovery in acute SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Animal models of compression spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compression spinal cord injuries are a common cause of morbidity in people who experience a spinal cord injury (SCI). Either as a by-product of a traumatic injury or due to nontraumatic conditions such as cervical myelitis, compression injuries are growing in prevalence clinically and many attempts of animal replication have been described within the literature. These models, however, often focus on the traumatic side of injury or mimic short-term injuries that are not representative of the majority of compression SCI. Of this, nontraumatic spinal cord injuries are severely understudied and have an increased prevalence in elderly populations, adults, and children. Therefore, there is a need to critically evaluate the current animal models of compression SCI and their suitability as a method for clinically relevant data that can help reduce morbidity and mortality of SCI. In this review, we reviewed the established and emerging methods of animal models of compression SCI. These models are the clip, balloon, solid spacer, expanding polymer, remote, weight drop, calibrated forceps, screw, and strap methods. These methods showed that there is a large reliance on the use of laminectomy to induce injury. Furthermore, the age range of many studies does not reflect the elderly and young populations that commonly suffer from compression injuries. It is therefore important to have techniques and methods that are able to minimize secondary effects of the surgeries, and are representative of the clinical cases seen so that treatments and interventions can be developed that are specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Interferon Œ≥: a master cytokine in microglia-mediated neural network dysfunction and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, lymphocytic interferon Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) was considered to be a simple 'booster' of proinflammatory responses by microglia (brain-resident macrophages) during bacterial or viral infection. Recent slice culture (in situ) and in vivo studies suggest, however, that IFN-Œ≥ has a unique role in microglial activation. Priming by IFN-Œ≥ results in proliferation (microgliosis), enhanced synapse elimination, and moderate nitric oxide release sufficient to impair synaptic transmission, gamma rhythm activity, and cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor in the human hypothalamus is associated with body mass index and colocalizes with the anorexigenic neuropeptide nucleobindin-2/nesfatin-1.</a></h4>

              
                Data on animals emphasize the importance of neuronal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) for feeding suppression, although it is unclear whether astrocytes participate in the transduction of anorectic GLP-1R-dependent signals. In humans, the brain circuitry underlying these effects remains insufficiently investigated. The present study aimed to explore GLP-1R protein expression in human hypothalamus and its correlation with body mass index (BMI). Sections of hypothalamus from 28 autopsy cases, 11 with normal weight (BMI<25 Kg/m2) and 17 with non-normal weight (BMI[&ge;]25 Kg/m2), were examined using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence labeling. Prominent GLP-1R immunoexpression was detected in neurons of several hypothalamic nuclei, including paraventricular, supraoptic, and infundibular nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area (LH), and basal forebrain nuclei. Interestingly, in LH, GLP-1R was significantly decreased in individuals with BMI[&ge;]25 Kg/m2, compared with normal weight counterparts (p=0.03). Furthermore, GLP-1R was negatively correlated ({tau}b=-0.347, p=0.024) with BMI levels only in the LH. GLP-1R extensively colocalized with the anorexigenic and anti-obesogenic neuropeptide nucleobindin-2/nesfatin-1, but not with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. These data suggest a potential role for GLP-1R in the regulation of energy balance in human hypothalamus, possibly through interactions with nesfatin-1. In LH, an appetite- and reward-related brain region, reduced GLP-1R immunoexpression may contribute to dysregulation of homeostatic and/or hedonic feeding behavior.
