              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22320">Nanoscale Connectomics Annotation Standards Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of large-scale, high-resolution datasets from Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-ray Microtomography (XRM) lies in their ability to reveal neural structures and synaptic connectivity, which is critical for understanding the brain. Effectively managing these complex and rapidly increasing datasets will enable new scientific insights, facilitate querying, and support secondary use across the neuroscience community. However, without effective neurodata standards that permit use of these data across multiple systems and workflows, these valuable and costly datasets risk being underutilized especially as they surpass petascale levels. These standards will promote data sharing through accessible interfaces, allow researchers to build on each other's work, and guide the development of tools and capabilities that are interoperable. Herein we outline a standards framework for creating and managing annotations originating and derived from high-resolution volumetric imaging and connectomic datasets, focusing on ensuring Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) practices. The goal is to enhance collaborative efforts, boost the reliability of findings, and enable comparative analysis across growing datasets of different species and modalities. We have formed a global working group with academic and industry partners in the high-resolution volumetric data generation and analysis community, focused on identifying gaps in current EM and XRM data pipelines, and refining outlines and platforms for standardizing EM and XRM methods. This focus considers existing and past community approaches and includes examining neuronal entities, biological components, and associated metadata, while emphasizing adaptability and fostering collaboration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21319">Towards Continuous Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity Monitoring: Removing Muscle Noise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.21319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of non-invasive skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) holds promise for understanding the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) dynamics in various physiological and pathological conditions. However, muscle noise artifacts present a challenge in accurate SKNA analysis, particularly in real-life scenarios. This study proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to detect and remove muscle noise from SKNA recordings obtained via ECG electrodes. Twelve healthy participants underwent controlled experimental protocols involving cognitive stress induction and voluntary muscle movements, while collecting SKNA data. Power spectral analysis revealed significant muscle noise interference within the SKNA frequency band (500-1000 Hz). A 2D CNN model was trained on the spectrograms of the data segments to classify them into baseline, stress-induced SKNA, and muscle noise-contaminated periods, achieving an average accuracy of 89.85% across all subjects. Our findings underscore the importance of addressing muscle noise for accurate SKNA monitoring, advancing towards wearable SKNA sensors for real-world applications.

                arXiv:2410.22051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe OHBA Software Library for the analysis of electrophysiological data (osl-ephys). This toolbox builds on top of the widely used MNE-Python package and provides unique analysis tools for magneto-/electro-encephalography (M/EEG) sensor and source space analysis, which can be used modularly. In particular, it facilitates processing large amounts of data using batch parallel processing, with high standards for reproducibility through a config API and log keeping, and efficient quality assurance by producing HTML processing reports. It also provides new functionality for doing coregistration, source reconstruction and parcellation in volumetric space, allowing for an alternative pipeline that avoids the need for surface-based processing, e.g., through the use of Fieldtrip. Here, we introduce osl-ephys by presenting examples applied to a publicly available M/EEG data (the multimodal faces dataset). osl-ephys is open-source software distributed on the Apache License and available as a Python package through PyPi and GitHub.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient deep learning solution for decoding motor movements from neural recordings in non-human primates. An Autoencoder Gated Recurrent Unit (AEGRU) model was adopted as the model architecture for this task. The autoencoder is only used during the training stage to achieve better generalization. Together with the preprocessing techniques, our model achieved 0.71 $R^2$ score, surpassing the baseline models in Neurobench and is ranked first for $R^2$ in the IEEE BioCAS 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Model pruning is also applied leading to a reduction of 41.4% of the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with little change in the $R^2$ score compared to the unpruned model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08823">Double opponency serves as a basis for color constancy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.08823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color constancy (CC) is one of the important perceptual abilities of the human visual system, which states that despite changes in illumination, the perceived colors of surfaces generally tend to remain constant. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying CC have been debated for several decades. A specific type of cell, known as the double opponent cell in the primary visual cortex (V1), is strongly implicated in achieving CC. However, the exact functioning manner of this cell type remains uncertain. In this work, our quantitative analysis of concentric double-opponent cells in V1 revealed their ability to identify gray surfaces within color-biased scenes. These gray surfaces can then be used to estimate the illumination easily. For the first time, this finding offers a clear functional explanation of concentric double-opponent receptive fields of this cell type in the visual system. Building on this insight, we introduced a novel computational theory--gray-anchoring (GA) theory--to explain how CC is achieved in the visual system. Specifically, GA-based CC involves detecting and anchoring gray surfaces within complex scenes. Our new theory serves as a bridge among the retinex theory, anchoring theory, and the neural mechanisms underlying visual CC in color vision.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00719">EEG-Deformer: A Dense Convolutional Transformer for Brain-computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effectively learning the temporal dynamics in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is challenging yet essential for decoding brain activities using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Although Transformers are popular for their long-term sequential learning ability in the BCI field, most methods combining Transformers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to capture the coarse-to-fine temporal dynamics of EEG signals. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EEG-Deformer, which incorporates two main novel components into a CNN-Transformer: (1) a Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine Transformer (HCT) block that integrates a Fine-grained Temporal Learning (FTL) branch into Transformers, effectively discerning coarse-to-fine temporal patterns; and (2) a Dense Information Purification (DIP) module, which utilizes multi-level, purified temporal information to enhance decoding accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on three representative cognitive tasks-cognitive attention, driving fatigue, and mental workload detection-consistently confirm the generalizability of our proposed EEG-Deformer, demonstrating that it either outperforms or performs comparably to existing state-of-the-art methods. Visualization results show that EEG-Deformer learns from neurophysiologically meaningful brain regions for the corresponding cognitive tasks. The source code can be found at https://github.com/yi-ding-cs/EEG-Deformer.

                arXiv:2409.03749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of a brain or a neural network to efficiently learn depends crucially on both the task structure and the learning rule. Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks. Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned. In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset. This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures.

Abstract: Beyond conventional productivity metrics, human interaction and collaboration dynamics merit careful consideration in our increasingly digital workspace. This research proposes a conjectural neuro-adaptive room that enhances group interactions by adjusting the physical environment to desired internal states. Drawing inspiration from previous work on collective consciousness, the system leverages computer vision and machine learning models to analyze physiological and behavioral cues, such as facial expressions and speech analysis, to infer the overall internal state of occupants. Environmental conditions of the room, such as visual projections, lighting and sound, are actively adjusted to create an optimal setting for inducing the desired state, including focus or collaboration. Our goal is to create a dynamic and responsive environment to support group needs, fostering a sense of collective consciousness and improving workplace well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21293">Large-scale Multi-objective Feature Selection: A Multi-phase Search Space Shrinking Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional datasets, where irrelevant and redundant features can degrade model performance and increase computational costs. This paper proposes a novel large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the search space shrinking, termed LMSSS, to tackle the challenges of feature selection particularly as a sparse optimization problem. The method includes a shrinking scheme to reduce dimensionality of the search space by eliminating irrelevant features before the main evolutionary process. This is achieved through a ranking-based filtering method that evaluates features based on their correlation with class labels and frequency in an initial, cost-effective evolutionary process. Additionally, a smart crossover scheme based on voting between parent solutions is introduced, giving higher weight to the parent with better classification accuracy. An intelligent mutation process is also designed to target features prematurely excluded from the population, ensuring they are evaluated in combination with other features. These integrated techniques allow the evolutionary process to explore the search space more efficiently and effectively, addressing the sparse and high-dimensional nature of large-scale feature selection problems. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on 15 large-scale datasets, showcasing its potential to identify more accurate feature subsets compared to state-of-the-art large-scale feature selection algorithms. These results highlight LMSSS's capability to improve model performance and computational efficiency, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: MicroLED displays are the result of a complex manufacturing chain. Each stage of this process, if optimized, contributes to achieving the highest levels of final efficiencies. Common works carried out by Pollen Metrology, Aledia, and Universit{\'e} Clermont-Auvergne led to a generic process optimization workflow. This software solution offers a holistic approach where stages are chained together for gaining a complete optimal solution. This paper highlights key corners of the methodology, validated by the experiments and process experts: data cleaning and multi-objective optimization.

                arXiv:2410.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A traditional approach to assessing emerging intelligence in the theory of intelligent systems is based on the similarity, 'imitation' of human-like actions and behaviors, benchmarking the performance of intelligent systems on the scale of human cognitive skills. In this work we attempt to outline the shortcomings of this line of thought, which is based on the implicit presumption of equivalence and compatibility of the originating and emergent intelligences. We provide arguments to the point that under some natural assumptions, developing intelligent systems will be able to form their own in-tents and objectives. Then, the difference in the rate of progress of natural and artificial systems that was noted on multiple occasions in the discourse on artificial intelligence can lead to the scenario of a progressive divergence of the intelligences, in their cognitive abilities, functions and resources, values, ethical frameworks, worldviews, intents and existential objectives, the scenario of the AGI evolutionary gap. We discuss evolutionary processes that can guide the development of emergent intelligent systems and attempt to identify the starting point of the progressive divergence scenario.

                arXiv:2306.15220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically plausible models that have been identified as potentially apt for deploying energy-efficient intelligence at the edge, particularly for sequential learning tasks. However, training of SNNs poses significant challenges due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training deep SNNs on event-based learning tasks. Furthermore, S-TLLR is designed to have low memory and time complexities, which are independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power edge devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. In all the experiments, S-TLLR achieved high accuracy, comparable to BPTT, with a reduction in memory between $5-50\times$ and multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations between $1.3-6.6\times$.

                arXiv:2405.15868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) using traditional backpropagation (BP) presents challenges in terms of computational complexity and energy consumption, particularly for on-device learning where computational resources are limited. Various alternatives to BP, including random feedback alignment, forward-forward, and local classifiers, have been explored to address these challenges. These methods have their advantages, but they can encounter difficulties when dealing with intricate visual tasks or demand considerable computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel Local Learning rule inspired by neural activity Synchronization phenomena (LLS) observed in the brain. LLS utilizes fixed periodic basis vectors to synchronize neuron activity within each layer, enabling efficient training without the need for additional trainable parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLS and its variations, LLS-M and LLS-MxM, on multiple image classification datasets, achieving accuracy comparable to BP with reduced computational complexity and minimal additional parameters. Specifically, LLS achieves comparable performance with up to $300 \times$ fewer multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations and half the memory requirements of BP. Furthermore, the performance of LLS on the Visual Wake Word (VWW) dataset highlights its suitability for on-device learning tasks, making it a promising candidate for edge hardware implementations.

Abstract: Physical computing has the potential to enable widespread embodied intelligence by leveraging the intrinsic dynamics of complex systems for efficient sensing, processing, and interaction. While individual devices provide basic data processing capabilities, networks of interconnected devices can perform more complex and varied tasks. However, designing networks to perform dynamic tasks is challenging without physical models and accurate quantification of device noise. We propose a novel, noise-aware methodology for training device networks using Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural-SDEs) as differentiable digital twins, accurately capturing the dynamics and associated stochasticity of devices with intrinsic memory. Our approach employs backpropagation through time and cascade learning, allowing networks to effectively exploit the temporal properties of physical devices. We validate our method on diverse networks of spintronic devices across temporal classification and regression benchmarks. By decoupling the training of individual device models from network training, our method reduces the required training data and provides a robust framework for programming dynamical devices without relying on analytical descriptions of their dynamics.

                arXiv:2407.00312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.

	<p>Background/Objectives: MMAE (middle meningeal artery embolization) has emerged as a potential effective treatment for cSDH (chronic subdural hematoma). In this study, MMAE efficiency with regards to cSDH cause and architecture was explored. The comparability of cSDH thickness and volume as parameters for cSDH pre- and post-MMAE assessment was also analyzed. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 52 consecutive cSDH patients treated with MMAE in a single tertiary center were included. The cohort was divided into two group pairs pertaining to cSDH cause (spontaneous or traumatic) and cSDH architecture (non-mature or mature). The radiological outcome was compared in each group before and after MMAE and between each group pair using CT imaging. A correlation analysis between cSDH thickness and volume before and after MMAE was also performed. Results: A statistically significant positive linear association between cSDH thickness and volume at admission and at each follow-up interval (1&amp;amp;ndash;3, 3&amp;amp;ndash;6, 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 months) was noticed. cSDH thickness and volume reduction in each group was statistically significant, except for a traumatic cSDH volume reduction at 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 months. There was no statistically significant difference between each group pair in the cSDH thickness and volume reduction difference at all the follow-up intervals. Conclusions: A comparable efficiency of MMAE may be achieved in non-mature and mature as well as in spontaneous and traumatic cSDH, with an advantage for spontaneous cSDH at 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 months follow-up compared to traumatic cSDH. Traumatic cSDH may require a relatively long-term follow-up post-MMAE. cSDH thickness and volume, as parameters for pre- and post-MMAE cSDH evaluation, appear similar.</p>

	<p>Objectives: During cochlear implant (CI) electrode placement, single low-frequency (e.g., 500 Hz) cochlear microphonics (CM) measurements are used to monitor hair-cell function and provide feedback to avert insertion trauma. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between trauma and the electrode&amp;amp;rsquo;s progression through the cochlea when monitored with a single frequency. Multi-frequency CM measurements, while more complex to analyze, can provide more accurate feedback by measuring CM from various locations along the basilar membrane. Methods: A new algorithm was developed to analyze multi-frequency CM tracings by comparing amplitude and phase changes across different test frequencies. The new algorithm was evaluated as to its ability to identify drop-alarm instances with the multi-frequency approach, as compared to single-frequency 500 Hz tracings. Results: The algorithm presented in this manuscript uses the relationship between CM amplitude and phase changes across frequencies to provide real-time feedback during CI electrode placement. The results show that multi-frequency CM tracings raised an alarm only 0.5 times, as compared to 2.8 instances of alarm raised for the single-frequency 500 Hz CM measurements. Conclusions: Multi-frequency CM tracings can help reduce the number of alarms which may be false positives prompting unnecessary electrode manipulations, thereby minimizing the risk of insertion trauma.</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are designed to precisely and selectively target specific brain regions, thus enabling focused modulation of neural activity. Among NIBS technologies, low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising new modality. The application of tFUS can safely and non-invasively stimulate deep brain structures with millimetric precision, offering distinct advantages in terms of accessibility to non-cortical regions over other NIBS methods. However, to date, several tFUS aspects still need to be characterized; furthermore, there are only a handful of studies that have utilized tFUS in psychiatric populations. This narrative review provides an up-to-date overview of key aspects of this NIBS technique, including the main components of a tFUS system, the neuronavigational tools used to precisely target deep brain regions, the simulations utilized to optimize the stimulation parameters and delivery of tFUS, and the experimental protocols employed to evaluate the efficacy of tFUS in psychiatric disorders. The main findings from studies in psychiatric populations are presented and discussed, and future directions are highlighted.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have shown that creative thinking is associated with metacontrol, but its neural basis is unknown. The present study explored the neural basis of both by assessing EEG complexity through multiscale entropy. Subjects were engaged in a metacontrol task and an Alternative Uses Task, grouped according to task performance, and the EEG was analysed by multiscale entropy. The results showed that EEG complexity was significantly higher in the high-metacontrol and high-creativity groups than in the low-metacontrol and low-creativity groups, respectively, at high time scales. The metacontrol adaptability score and multipurpose task score were significantly and positively correlated with the EEG complexity at multiple electrode sites. It suggests that metacontrol and creativity are dependent on the activation of long-duration neural networks.</p>

	<p>Background: The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between low muscle mass (LMM) and depression, with a specific focus on identifying the sex-specific relationship between LMM and depression in a large sample. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study involved 292,922 community-dwelling adults from 2012 to 2019. Measurements were taken using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) scale and body composition analyses. Depression was defined as a CESD score &amp;amp;ge; 16, and severe depression as a CESD score &amp;amp;ge; 22. LMM was defined as an appendicular muscle mass/height2 below 7.0 kg/m2 in men and below 5.4 kg/m2 in women. Sex-based multivariable logistic regression analyzed the LMM&amp;amp;ndash;depression association, adjusting for confounders, with depression status and severe depression status as dependent variables. Results: Both men and women in the LMM group had an increased odds of depression (men, adjusted odds ratio = 1.13 [95% confidence interval = 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;1.12]; women, 1.07 [1.03&amp;amp;ndash;1.23]) and severe depression (men, 1.20 [1.05&amp;amp;ndash;1.36]; women, 1.10 [1.04&amp;amp;ndash;1.15]) compared to those in the control group. Men showed a stronger association between LMM and the presence of depression (p for interaction = 0.025) and the presence of severe depression (p for interaction = 0.025) compared to women. Conclusions: Decreased muscle mass was independently associated with increased chances of depression and severe depression in both sexes, with a significantly stronger association in men compared to women. This highlights the potential significance of LMM as a predictor of depression, particularly in men.</p>

	<p>In the past five years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has evolved significantly, driven by advancements in device design, treatment protocols, software integration, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This review evaluates how these innovations enhance the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of rTMS while identifying key challenges such as protocol standardization and ethical considerations. A structured review of peer-reviewed studies from 2019 to 2024 focused on technological and clinical advancements in rTMS, including AI-driven personalized treatments, portable devices, and integrated BCIs. AI algorithms have optimized patient-specific protocols, while portable devices have expanded access. Enhanced coil designs and BCI integration offer more precise and adaptive neuromodulation. However, challenges remain in standardizing protocols, addressing device complexity, and ensuring equitable access. While recent innovations improve rTMS&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical utility, gaps in long-term efficacy and ethical concerns persist. Future research must prioritize standardization, accessibility, and robust ethical frameworks to ensure rTMS&amp;amp;rsquo;s sustainable impact.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural processes involved in visual detection, decision-making, and motor plan execution are believed to play a key role in the avoidance of sport-related injuries, but very little evidence exists to guide the development of training activities for the optimization of brain function. Immersive virtual reality provides a means to precisely measure the amount of time that elapses from visual stimulus presentation to the initiation of a motor response (i.e., perceptual latency) or its completion (i.e., response time). Methods: The median value of a metric quantifying both the speed and accuracy (i.e., the rate correct per second of response time) of 50 high school female soccer players was used to assign those who exhibited suboptimal performance to a training program. Training sessions required less than 5 min and the number of sessions completed over a 7-week period ranged from 3 to 13 (median = 5). Results: Among 42 players available for follow-up assessment at 8 weeks after the first practice session (training n = 19; comparison n = 23), the results of regression-discontinuity analyses demonstrated statistically significant differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) for metrics representing fast/accurate movement initiation (i.e., the rate correct score for perceptual latency, p = 0.016) and across-trial consistency (i.e., perceptual latency variability, p = 0.027). From the first practice session to the end of the soccer season, 12 injuries were sustained by 10 players (four concussions and eight musculoskeletal injuries). A time-to-event analysis demonstrated strong associations with perceptual latency variability &amp;amp;ge; 0.143 (Hazard Ratio = 15.43, p = 0.011) and a lifetime history of at least one concussion (Hazard Ratio = 8.84, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The strong association of movement initiation consistency with the avoidance of concussion or musculoskeletal injury suggests that the training program may have a highly beneficial far-transfer effect.</p>

                Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in intensity, the virus continues to circulate globally. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, making it important for the development of treatments against future variants of the virus. In this work, Peruvian natural compounds were evaluated against different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Methods In silico techniques such as virtual screening, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and energy estimation analysis were applied. Results Of the tested compounds by virtual screening, rutin was identified as the best binding agent against the different proposed Mpro mutations. In addition, computational simulations and energy estimation analysis demonstrated the high structural and energetic stability between the Mpro-rutin systems. Conclusions Overall, our study identified rutin as the most promising compound with a strong affinity for various Mpro mutations, potentially playing a key role in the development of new treatments for emerging viral variants.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Smoking may also increase the risk of developing ACS. The most advantageous therapy is percutaneous coronary intervention. However, this therapy may fail because of the no-reflow phenomenon. This case report describes a young male patient admitted to the emergency department due to ST-segment elevation of myocardial infarction (STEMI), with smoking as the only risk factor. Case description A 37-year-old male presented to our hospital with a typical chest pain. He was a heavy smoker. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed extensive anterior STEMI. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a high-burden thrombus. The no-reflow phenomenon occurs during Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI). After two days of hospitalization, the patient developed cardiogenic shock and acute decompensated heart failure. The patient was administered ticagrelor, acetylsalicylic acid, enoxaparin for three days, high-dose statins, and optimized heart failure treatment. The patient was discharged on the 7th day after admission. Discussion Cigarette smoke chemicals may induce atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries. Lipid oxidation leads to plaque formation. If plaque ruptures, it will cause thrombus occlusion. A high-burden thrombus can induce a no-reflow phenomenon, leading to heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Conclusion Smoking may induce STEMI and tends to result in a high-burden thrombus. The no-reflow phenomenon is an evidence of miscarriage during PCI, which may increase because of smoking.

                Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The research findings indicate that the households of migrant women who sell jamu gendong can survive and adapt during their migration to prevent poverty by implementing diverse livelihood strategies. They are the only ones who move without their family members renting a place to live with them. This research has identified various capital sources, including productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong; physical capital, including road infrastructure, markets, and access to health and education facilities; and natural, social, and financial capital. This research provides an in-depth understanding of women’s roles in family economic resilience, diversification of life strategies, the importance of social capital in migrant networks, economic empowerment through migration, and the influence of cultural values on livelihood strategies. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.

                Background Teaching professionalization aimed at the digital transformation of educational scenarios and training processes for students in contemporary higher education requires the mastery of digital competence by the teaching staff. The objectives of the study were to analyze the self-perceived level of digital teaching competence (DTC) of the faculty of the Technical University of Manabí (UTM), Ecuador, and to establish the relationship between age, sex, and academic profile variables with digital teaching competence. Methods A quantitative methodological approach was adopted to develop a descriptive-correlational field study with a non-experimental design. The participants were 277 professors, selected through non-probabilistic and voluntary sampling, who completed the DigCompEdu Check-In questionnaire sent by e-mail. Results The data revealed that the “integrator” and “expert” categories achieved high levels in all competencies. In particular, 48.74% of the participants were placed in the integrator category in the competence of facilitating skills, while 46.21% positioned themselves as integrators in the competence of evaluation and feedback. Additionally, a significant difference was found in the pedagogy variable in the interaction. Conclusions It is concluded that the competences self-perceived by the professors are within the intermediate categories such as integrator and expert. Likewise, the age, sex, and academic profile variables differ in the digital pedagogy level, which produces an inconsistent relationship, with the exception of the variable evaluates and provides feedback, where it was significant.

                <p>Deficits in social behavior are found in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Since abnormalities in cerebellar morphology and function are observed in ASD patients, the cerebellum is thought to play a role in social behavior. However, it remains unknown whether the cerebellum is involved in social behavior in other animals and how cerebellar circuits control social behavior. To address this issue, we employed zebrafish stereotyped orienting behavior as a model of social behaviors, in which a pair of adult zebrafish in two separate tanks approach each other, with one swimming at synchronized angles (orienting angles) with the other. We harnessed transgenic zebrafish that express botulinum toxin, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters, in either granule cells or Purkinje cells (PCs), and zebrafish mutants of <I>reelin</I>, which is involved in the positioning of cerebellar neurons, including PCs. These zebrafish, deficient in the function or formation of cerebellar neural circuits, showed a significantly shorter period of orienting behavior compared with their control siblings. We found an increase in c-<I>fos</I> and <I>egr1</I> expression in the cerebellum after the orienting behavior. These results suggest that zebrafish cerebellar circuits play an important role in social orienting behavior.</p>

                <p>Illusionism is a general philosophical framework in which specific theories of consciousness can be constructed without having to invoke a magical mind essence. The advantages of illusionism are not widely recognized, perhaps because scholars tend to think only of the most extreme forms and miss the range of possibilities. The brain's internal models are never fully accurate, nothing is exactly as the brain represents it, and therefore some element of illusionism is almost certainly necessary for any working theory of consciousness or of any other property that is accessed through introspection. Here I describe the illusionist framework and propose six specific theories. One purpose of this article is to demonstrate the range of possibilities in a domain that is not yet sufficiently explored. The second purpose is to argue that even existing, popular theories, such as the integrated information theory or the global workspace theory, can be transformed and greatly strengthened by adding an illusionist layer. The third purpose is to argue that when illusionist logic is used, even very disparate theories of consciousness that emerge from unrelated conceptual origins begin to converge onto a deeper, unified understanding.</p>

                <p>The rat dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS), equivalent to caudate nucleus and putamen in primates, are required for goal-directed and habit behaviour, respectively. However, it is still unclear whether and how this functional dichotomy emerges in the course of learning. In this study, we investigated this issue by recording DMS and DLS single neuron activity in rats performing a continuous spatial alternation task, from the acquisition to optimized performance. We first applied a classical analytical approach to identify task-related activity based on the modifications of single neuron firing rate in relation to specific task events or maze trajectories. We then used an innovative approach based on Hawkes process to reconstruct a directed connectivity graph of simultaneously recorded neurons, that was used to decode animal behavior. This approach enabled us to better unravel the role of DMS&nbsp;and DLS neural networks across learning stages. We showed that DMS and DLS display different task-related activity throughout learning stages, and the proportion of coding neurons over time decreases in the DMS and increases in the DLS. Despite these major differences, the decoding power of both networks increases during learning. These results suggest that DMS and DLS neural networks gradually reorganize in different ways in order to progressively increase their control over the behavioral performance.</p>

It occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies such as, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans rendering them unfavorable for various purposes for example drinking, recreation, and support to aquatic life. Globally, over 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. In Africa, lack of clean water and sanitation is a significant challenge in many countries, affecting approximately 319 million people. Thus, water pollution is one of the types of pollution that has been threatening the lives of living organisms. Implementing effective policies and strategies can have a profound impact on the environment and local communities. By reducing pollution levels and improving water quality, we can create a healthier environment and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to improved health and well-being for residents. The research on water pollution in the River Meizimera Kihihi has important implications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, and communities and society. In conclusion, effective policies can foster community involvement, raise awareness, and promote collective action to address water pollution. By achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), we can contribute to the broader sustainable development goals. This research has important ramifications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, communities, and society. This study investigated the problems of water pollution, its causes, its impact, and the current effort to address the issues along the river of Meizimera-kihihi, Kanugu district, Uganda. Recommendations were made, which included encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, industrial processes, and waste management strategies to minimize pollution.

                <p>by Keith Murphy, Elsa Fouragnan</p>

Our understanding of brain circuit operations and disorders has rapidly outpaced our ability to intervene and restore them. Developing technologies that can precisely interface with any brain region and circuit may combine diagnostics with therapeutic intervention, expediting personalised brain medicine. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising noninvasive solution to this challenge, offering focal precision and scalability. By exploiting the biomechanics of pressure waves on brain tissue, TUS enables multi-site targeted neuromodulation across distributed circuits in the cortex and deeper areas alike. In this Essay, we explore the emergent evidence that TUS can functionally test and modify dysfunctional regions, effectively serving as a search and rescue tool for the brain. We define the challenges and opportunities faced by TUS as it moves towards greater target precision and integration with advanced brain monitoring and interventional technology. Finally, we propose a roadmap for the evolution of TUS as it progresses from a research tool to a clinically validated therapeutic for brain disorders.

                Background Hydatidosis of the thoracic wall differs from other hydatid localizations in its pathophysiology, diagnostic, and therapeutic management. It is a little-studied entity. The objectives of our work were to describe its surgical management and to analyze the factors that may influence recurrence and mortality. Methods A retrospective, descriptive, longitudinal, and multicenter study on four university hospital surgical centers of Tunis, from January 1995 to December 2022 including operated hydatid cysts of the thoracic wall. Overall survival (OS) and cumulative recurrence rates were calculated. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify recurrence and mortality risk factors. Results Forty-nine patients were included. The mean age was 41 ± 17 years [8-76]. The main presenting sign was thoracic parietal swelling (n=22). Chest ultrasound and CT scan showed multivesicular formation in 17 and 33 cases, respectively. Muscle involvement was in the intercostal (n=4), paravertebral (n=13), and pectoralis major (n=3) muscles. Bone involvement was vertebral (n=11), costal (n=12), costo-vertebral (n=21) and sternal (n=2). A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed (n=20). Surgical excision at various levels of the chest wall with spinal stabilization (n=15) was performed. Sixty-three percent of the patients received antiparasitic medical treatment. Recurrence occurred in 37% of cases. Four patients died from hydatidosis-related complications. Factors could be independently associated with recurrence such as male gender, and vertebral involvement. The presence of a visceral hydatid cyst located at a distance from the parietal lesion at the time of diagnosis and the occurrence of postoperative infectious complications could increase mortality. Conclusions Chest wall hydatidosis represents a rare medical condition where surgery remains the preferred treatment modality. However, it carries a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality, influenced by various factors. Further large-scale studies are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of these factors and to optimize management strategies accordingly.

                Background Physical activity trackers possess the potential to encourage increased physical activity. However, users often exhibit poor long-term adherence to these devices, which may stem from a lack of understanding of the factors influencing their use, as well as changes in health behavior. This study aims to provide new insights into the types of health-related apps and devices that young people discover, select, and utilize, along with the underlying reasons for their choices. Methods Young adults aged between 18-25 years reporting the use and nonuse of health apps and wearables were recruited and participated in focus group discussions about app choice, features, their perceptions towards the physical activity trackers, and reasons for continued use and for not using one. A total of Nine FGDS were conducted among users, nonusers, and former users of physical activity tracker usage. Data was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes in an iterative approach. Results The physical activity tracker users group stated that they had a sense of achievement, validation, and other motivational feedback, which helped with adherence. All three groups (user, non-user, and former user) had similar concerns about cost, reliability, accuracy, and dependency. Former users also reported that the idea of accomplishing the goals would create anxiety and, in turn, harm the body. Former users and nonusers expressed their concerns regarding lack of time and loss of motivation to track their physical activity. Nonusers had issues with the functionality of the device (ease of use, battery, notifications, apps hang) and were also aware of all the health benefits of using wearables. Conclusion Physical activity users group, former users group, and nonusers group shared concerns about accuracy, cost, and battery.

                Background Actions that are repetitive and being practiced automatically are called habits. Oral habits can be classified as normal or deleterious. Oral health education starts from footprints of awareness. Growing children require appropriate guidance for healthy growth and maintenance of their teeth, which makes the parent an active participant in the prevention and treatment of malocclusion and thus is majorly affected by their knowledge and attitude regarding various deleterious oral habits and habit breaking appliances. Aim To assess and compare awareness of deleterious oral habits and knowledge of habit breaking appliance, among parents at Alkharj Saudi Arabia. Methodology Study assessed awareness of deleterious oral habits and knowledge of habit breaking appliances among parents in Alkharj, Saudi Arabia. Results Conclusion Majority of the parents were aware of different deleterious oral habits but not aware of the dimensions of interventions like types of appliances, duration of use, etc. without knowing mentioned facts, in future which leads to development of malocclusion which probably requires orthodontic, surgical or prosthetic intervention correcting the outcomes of oral deleterious habits.

                Background Sustainable supply chains are more competitive than conventional supply chains. Supply chain sustainability performance needs to be carried out to determine sustainability under current conditions and to design appropriate strategies to increase sustainability. This study aims to design a sustainability performance assessment model for the sago agro-industry supply chain and identify critical indicators for sustainability improvement. Methods The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) evaluates sustainability on three levels: economic, social, and environmental. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is then used to aggregate the overall sustainability performance. The cosine amplitude method (CAM) was used to analyze key indicators. This study assessed the sustainability performance on industrial- and small-medium-scale sago agro-industry. Results The results show that the supply chain sustainability performance on the industrial scale is 44.25, while it is 48.81 for the small-medium scale with the same status, almost sustainable. Key indicators for improving sago agro-industry supply chain sustainability performance include profit distribution among supply chain actors, institutional support for supply chains, waste utilization (reuse & recycle), and the availability of waste management facilities. The implication of this research for managers regards assessing the current status of sustainability performance and key indicators as a reference for formulating sustainability strategies and practices. Implication The sago agro-industry sustainability performance evaluation methodology uses industry-relevant metrics to assess supply chain sustainability, promoting collaboration among stakeholders and assisting in the creation of sustainable strategies. Conclusions The results of the study will enable supply chain actors to understand the key indicators for improving sustainability performance in the sago agro-industry supply chain, especially in Meranti Islands Regency, Riau Province. The proposed model can be applied to other agro-industries by adjusting the indicators used and assessing data availability and suitability for the research object.

                Background Heat polymerized acrylic (HPA) resins are known to have high porosity that contributes to increased surface roughness and microcrack formation in stress areas. This facilitates the attachment and growth of polymicrobial biofilms contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance. Many research had been carried out on avocado seeds, but no research that studies avocado seeds effect on denture-plaque microorganism biofilm on HPA resin has been found. Methods This study used 144 samples (n=144), namely HPA resin discs covered with mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms. The discs were soaked for 8 hours in the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% avocado seed extract, positive control (alkaline peroxide), and negative control (aquadest). Each disc was shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 minute, and 100 μL was added into 96-well microplates with three times repetition and incubated for 24 hours. A microtiter plate biofilm formation assay was then conducted The inhibition values were determined from the percentage inhibition value formula which required absorption values from a microplate reader (595 nm). The research data were analyzed using a univariant test, and a one-way ANOVA test, accompanied by Welch ANOVA on non-homogenous data. Results In this research, it was found that the MBIC50 of avocado seed extract against the mono-species of C. albicans (5%), C. glabrata (5%), A. odontolyticus (15%), S. gordonii (15%), S. aureus (10%), while against polymicrobial was 20%. There was a significant effect of soaking HPA resin in avocado seed extract on the inhibition of mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms with a value of p<0.001 (p<0.05). Conclusion The MBIC50 of avocado seed extract in polymicrobial biofilm group was higher than that in the mono-species biofilm groups. Although alkaline peroxide showed higher inhibition value than that of the MBIC50 in polymicrobial biofilm group, 20% avocado seed extract was concluded effective as it inhibited >50% polymicrobial biofilm.

                Background As of July 2021, only 57% of Ecuador’s population had received the first vaccine dose against COVID-19. The national immunization campaign faced difficulties in reaching and providing vaccines to underserved population in remote areas. Methods The RISE project, funded by USAID and implemented by Jhpiego, aimed to develop an immunization strategy, that through the collaboration of an international non-profit organization, an academic institution and the public sector, could effectively support the national vaccination campaign of the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health. Results The program identified gaps in vaccination access and uptake, established specific strategies for targeted communities, analyzed official geographical information on vaccination coverage, ran micro-planning exercises at the local level, and adapted to new needs identified to ensure an effective vaccination uptake. From November 2021 up to May 2023, more than 1.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered to underserved populations living in geographically dispersed areas, in 18 provinces. Conclusions Employing data-targeted approaches and microplanning to identify underserved populations, strategic planning and collaboration between local governments, private sector, academic institution, and community leaders can substantially improve COVID-19 vaccines coverage and, thus, equity to vaccine access. The lessons learned might be useful to improve overall immunization service delivery.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure throughout gestation and breastfeeding leads to multiple adverse outcomes in the hepatic system. Under oxidative stress, alterations in the liver are related to the inhibition of induced nitric oxide synthase activity in sinusoidal cells as a consequence of low expression of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinase interacting (GIT1). Here, we hypothesized that both glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and GIT1 could be altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of human equivalent development. Methods We exposed rats during the third trimester equivalent [postnatal days (PD) 2-8] to moderate levels of maternal EtOH (20%). GPx1 and GIT1 expression was detected by western blotting, and the antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase GPx and the concentration of hepatic carbonyl groups (CG were determined by spectrophotometry. Serum biochemistry parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose (gluc), cholesterol (chol), and triglycerides (TG) were also measured. Results We found that ethanol decreased both GIT1 and GPx1 selenoprotein expression, affecting GPx antioxidant activity and increasing protein oxidation. Conclusions These results demonstrate for the first time that the GPx antioxidant system altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of development is related to a parallel decrease in GIT1 expression [1].

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1292/v1?src=rss">Computational prediction of a phage cocktail active against multidrug-resistant bacteria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Antibiotic misuse and overuse have contributed to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, posing a serious public health problem across the globe. Phage cocktails, which combine multiple phages, provide an efficient method to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. This study integrated a computational pipeline to design a phage cocktail against the bacterial strains Acinetobacter baumannii AB0057, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae HS11286, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. Methods The whole genome sequences of selected multidrug-resistant bacteria were accessed. Prophage sequences were identified from them which could be expressed to produce viable lytic phages against MDR bacterial strains, thereby reducing the severity of infection. Prophages were annotated for open reading frames (ORFs), putative promoters, virulence factors, transcriptional terminators, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNAs. A dot plot was also generated to investigate similar phages and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results A total of 11 prophages were predicted from the bacterial genomes. About 472 open reading frames were predicted along with 3 transfer RNAs. Additionally, the presence of 754 putative promoters and 281 transcription terminator sequences was also detected. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses provided insight into the diversity, relatedness, and lytic potential of the phages. The final designed phage cocktail consisted of five selected prophages including Acinetobacter baumannii prophages (2759376-2809756) and (3311844-3364667), and Klebsiella pneumoniae prophages (1288317-1338719), (1778306-1808606), and (2280703-2325555). Conclusion The phage cocktail designed in this study might be useful against MDR Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, especially where conventional antibiotics fail. Sequence similarity analysis suggested that the phage cocktail may also be effective against other carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains.

Loss of the NUP98 fusion-Menin-KMT2A complex is insufficient to repress HOX/MEIS transcription without PRC1.1. Rather, PRC1.1 deposits repressive histone modifications that are essential for stable consolidation of gene repression.

                Patients present a wide range of clinical severities in response severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, but the underlying molecular and cellular reasons why clinical outcomes vary so greatly within the population remains unknown. Here, we report that negative clinical outcomes in severely ill patients were associated with divergent RNA transcriptome profiles in peripheral immune cells compared with mild cases during the first weeks after disease onset. Protein–protein interaction analysis indicated that early-responding cytotoxic natural killer cells were associated with an effective clearance of the virus and a less severe outcome. This innate immune response was associated with the activation of select cytokine–cytokine receptor pathways and robust Th1/Th2 cell differentiation profiles. In contrast, severely ill patients exhibited a dysregulation between innate and adaptive responses affiliated with divergent Th1/Th2 profiles and negative outcomes. This knowledge forms the basis of clinical triage that may be used to preemptively detect high-risk patients before life-threatening outcomes ensue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87780">Linking the evolution of two prefrontal brain regions to social and foraging challenges in primates</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance (an index of ecological constraints), and population density (an index of social constraints). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.

                The foveated architecture of the human retina and the eye’s mobility enables prime spatial vision, yet the interplay between photoreceptor cell topography and the constant motion of the eye during fixation remains unexplored. With in vivo foveal cone-resolved imaging and simultaneous microscopic photo stimulation, we examined visual acuity in both eyes of 16 participants while precisely recording the stimulus path on the retina. We find that resolution thresholds were correlated with the individual retina’s sampling capacity, and exceeded what static sampling limits would predict by 18%, on average. The length and direction of fixational drift motion, previously thought to be primarily random, played a key role in achieving this sub-cone diameter resolution. The oculomotor system finely adjusts drift behavior towards retinal areas with higher cone densities within only a few hundred milliseconds to enhance retinal sampling.

">Transcriptional profiling of the cortico-accumbal pathway reveals sex-specific alterations underlying stress susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and depressive disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), affect millions of people every year, imposing significant socio-economic burdens. In this scenario, current treatments for MDD show limited efficacy, highlighting the need to better understand its molecular mechanisms. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been identified as a critical brain region in MDD pathology, displaying altered activity and morphology. This study targets the mPFC-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway, which is implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior. We used a pathway-specific approach to uncover transcriptional profiles in mPFC neurons projecting to the NAc in stressed male and female mice. Using the RiboTag technique and RNA sequencing, we identified sex-specific gene expression changes, revealing potential roles in stress susceptibility. Differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analyses revealed distinct transcriptional responses to chronic stress in males and females. Key findings include the identification of the X-linked lymphocyte-regulated 4B (Xlr4b) gene, within a highly relevant gene module, as a stress susceptibility driver in males. By experimentally overexpressing the Xlr4b gene, we characterized its crucial role in regulating neuronal firing and influencing arborization patterns to promote anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific fashion. These findings suggest that chronic stress induces unique and shared transcriptional alterations in mPFC neurons projecting to the NAc. Some of these alterations change the morphological and functional properties of neuronal pathways ultimately contributing to the differential manifestation of anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in male and female mice.

">Adaptive Gaze and Hand Coordination while Manipulating and Monitoring the Environment in Parallel</a></h4>

              
                Research on eye-hand coordination has focused on action tasks performed in isolation. However, real world action tasks are often performed concurrently with perception tasks that compete for gaze. Here we examine how participants adapt their eye and hand movements when performing an object manipulation task, in which they repeatedly grasped a ball and inserted it into a slot, while simultaneously monitoring a text display to detect probabilistically occurring letter changes. We varied the visuomotor demands of the action task by having participants use either their fingertips or tweezers. We found that fixations allocated to the action task were exclusively directed to the ball and slot, and were more prevalent when using tweezers. The timing of ball and slot fixations were coupled in time with ball grasp and slot entry. On average, gaze shifted away from the landmarks ~400 ms before contact when using fingertips,allowing the use of peripheral vision to direct the hand, and around the contact time when using tweezers, further allowing central vision to guide the hand as it approached the ball or slot. We found that participants controlled the timing of their hand movements, as well as the timing and patterns (sequence of fixations) of their eye movements, to exploit the temporal regularities of the perception task, thereby lowering the probability that a letter change would occur during action task fixations. Our results illustrate that eye-hand coordination can be flexibly and intelligently adapted when simultaneously acting on and perceiving the environment.

">A Surface-based deep learning approach for cortical shape analysis</a></h4>

              
                Advances in deep learning hold promise for predicting clinical factors from human brain images. In this study, we applied a spherical harmonics-based convolutional neural network approach (SPHARM-Net) to MRI-derived brain shape metrics to predict age, sex, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. MRI-derived brain features included vertex-wise cortical curvature, convexity, thickness, and surface area. SPHARM-Net performs convolutions using the spherical harmonic transforms, eliminating the need to explicitly define neighborhood size, and achieving rotational equivariance. Sex classification and age regression were carried out in a large sample of healthy adults (UK Biobank; N=32,979), and AD classification performance was tested in a large, publicly available sample (ADNI; N=1,213). SPHARM-Net showed strong performance for sex classification (accuracy=0.91; balanced accuracy= 0.91; AUC=0.97), and age regression (average absolute error=2.97 years; R-squared=0.77; Pearson's coefficient=0.9). AD classification also performed well (accuracy=0.86; balanced accuracy=0.83; AUC=0.9). Our experiments demonstrate promising preliminary performance using the SPHARM-Net for two widely studied benchmarking tasks and for AD classification. Future work will include comparisons of shape-based methods and extending these analysis to more challenging tasks such as mood disorder classification.

">SCAD Delivery Platform: A Novel Approach for Efficient CNS and Extrahepatic Oligonucleotide Therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                Oligonucleotide therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and duplex RNAs like siRNA, saRNA, and miRNA, hold immense potential for treating genetic and acquired diseases by modulating gene expression in a target-specific manner. However, effective delivery to extrahepatic tissues, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), remains a significant challenge. While GalNAc conjugation has enabled liver-specific delivery, leading to several approved siRNA drugs for hepatic targets, CNS delivery lags. ASOs, on the other hand, can self-deliver to the CNS when administered locally, as seen with nusinersen and tofersen. To address this disparity, we've developed the Smart Chemistry Aided Delivery (SCAD) platform which enables duplex RNA delivery by conjugating it to an accessory oligonucleotide (ACO), which acts as an aptamer to mediate protein binding and facilitate cellular uptake. Through extensive screening, we identified an optimal SCAD architecture that demonstrates enhanced cell-free protein binding and in vitro activity. In rodent models, local administration of SCAD-siRNA conjugates resulted in broad biodistribution throughout the CNS and sustained mRNA knockdown for over five months, with a favorable safety profile. The SCAD platform also exhibited efficient delivery to other tissues, including the eye, the lung and the joint. These features support its potential for broader clinical applications, as evidenced by an ongoing trial targeting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with mutations in the SOD1 gene. The modular design of SCAD allows it to easily adapt to any duplex RNA, making it a powerful tool for advancing oligonucleotide therapeutics.

">Retrograde transport of neurotrophin receptor TrkB-FL induced by excitotoxicity regulates Golgi stability and is a target for stroke neuroprotection</a></h4>

              
                Excitotoxicity, aberrant function of survival pathways dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and disruption of the Golgi complex are shared pathological hallmarks of relevant chronic and acute neurological diseases, including stroke. However, precise interdependence among these mechanisms is not completely defined, a knowledge essential to develop neuroprotective strategies. For ischemic stroke, a leading cause of death, disability and dementia, promising results have been obtained by interfering excitotoxicity, major mechanism of neuronal death in the penumbra area surrounding the infarct. We are exploring neuroprotection by promotion of survival cascades dependent on BDNF binding to full-length tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB-FL) receptor, which become aberrant after excitotoxicity induction. We have previously developed a blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable neuroprotective peptide (MTFL457) containing a TrkB-FL sequence which efficiently prevents receptor processing induced by excitotoxicity and preserves BDNF-dependent pathways in a model of ischemia, where it efficiently decreases infarct size and improves neurological outcome after stroke. In this work, using cellular and animal models, we demonstrate that excitotoxicity-induced TrkB-FL downregulation is secondary to receptor endocytosis, receptor interaction with endosomal protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), retrograde transport to the Golgi and disruption of this organelle. Interestingly, peptide MTFL457 efficiently interferes TrkB-FL/Hrs interaction and receptor trafficking, processes required for excitotoxic Golgi fragmentation and TrkB-FL cleavage, demonstrating a central role for TrkB-FL in the control of Golgi stability. These results also suggest the potential of peptide MTFL457 to preserve function of this organelle and of critical neuronal survival pathways in stroke and, probably, other neurodegenerative diseases associated to excitotoxicity.

">Maladaptation of Memory Systems Impairs Dorsal CA1-Dependent Temporal Binding and Declarative Memory in The Cntnap2 Knockout Mouse Model of Autism</a></h4>

              
                The CA1 region of the hippocampus plays a multifaceted role in cognitive functions related to temporal binding, spatial navigation, and social interactions. Growing evidence reports a role of the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder, particularly in social interactions and cognitive domains. Yet, the mechanisms driving hippocampal-driven cognitive impairments remain poorly defined. Here, we characterized how dorsal CA1 dysfunction impacts the long term retention of temporally discontiguous events. We found that Cntnap2 knockout mice exhibit reduced temporal binding capabilities compared to controls, stemming from decreased dorsal CA1 activity during temporal gaps. We further demonstrate a deficit of the flexibility component of relational/declarative memory in Cntnap2 KO mice. This impairment was secondary to the use of a procedural learning strategy associated with the imbalance of memory systems, in favor of the activity of the frontal-striatal areas, instead of the hippocampus. This study offers deeper insights into how memory systems are mistuned in autism, opening new avenues for understanding and addressing atypical cognition in this condition.

">Slit regulates compartment-specific targeting of dendrites and axons in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Proper functioning of the nervous system requires precise neuronal connections at subcellular domains, which can be achieved by projection of axons or dendrites to subcellular domains of target neurons. Here we studied subcellular-specific targeting of dendrites and axons in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), where mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and local dopaminergic neurons (DAN) project their dendrites and axons, respectively, to specific compartments of MB axons. Through genetic ablation, we demonstrate that compartment-specific targeting of MBON dendrites and DAN axons involves mutual repulsion of MBON dendrites and/or DAN axons between neighboring compartments. We further show that Slit expressed in subset of DANs mediates such repulsion by acting through different Robo receptors in different neurons. Loss of Slit-mediated repulsion leads to projection of MBON dendrites and DAN axons into neighboring compartments, resulting formation of ectopic synaptic contacts between MBONs and DANs and changes in olfactory-associative learning. Together, our findings suggest that Slit-mediated repulsion controls compartment-specific targeting of MBON dendrites and DAN axons, which ensures precise connections between MBON dendrites and DAN axons and proper learning and memory formation.

">Transcranial Brain-Wide Functional Ultrasound and Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in Mice using Multilinear Probes</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) and ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) are advanced ultrasound imaging modalities for assessing both functional and anatomical characteristics of the brain. However, the application of these techniques at a whole-brain scale has been limited by technological challenges. While conventional linear acoustic probes provide a narrow 2D field of view and matrix probes lack sufficient sensitivity for 3D transcranial fUS, multilinear probes have been developed to combine high sensitivity to blood flow with fast 3D acquisitions. In this study, we present a novel approach the combined implementation of transcranial whole-brain fUS and ULM in mice using a motorized multilinear probe. This technique provides high-resolution, non-invasive imaging of neurovascular dynamics across the entire brain. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between absolute cerebral blood volume ({Delta}CBV) increases and microbubble velocity, indicating vessel-level dependency of the evoked response. However, the lack of correlation with relative CBV (rCBV) suggests that fUS cannot distinguish functional responses alterations across different arterial vascular compartments. This methodology holds promise for advancing our understanding of neurovascular coupling and could be applied in brain disease diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring.

">An fMRI-based Approach for Measuring Contrast Sensitivity Across the Visual Field in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral vision is crucial for daily activities and quality of life, yet traditional measures of visual function like visual acuity primarily assess central vision. Visual field tests can evaluate peripheral vision but require extended focus combined with precise fixation, often very challenging for patients with severe sight loss. Functional MRI (fMRI) with population receptive field (pRF) mapping offers a non-invasive way to map scotomas but is limited by its reliance on single contrast levels and the necessity of accurate fixation. We developed an fMRI-based approach to measure contrast sensitivity across the visual field without the need for precise fixation. By combining large-field stimulation with varying spatial frequencies and contrast levels with either pRF mapping or a retinotopic atlas based on anatomical landmarks, we modeled contrast sensitivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) over a large (40 deg) expanse of the visual field. In seven normal-sighted participants, we characterized differences in V1 cortical sensitivity across eccentricities and visual quadrants, finding reliable and reproducible patterns of sensitivity differences at individual and session levels. Additionally, our method effectively visualized cases of simulated and disease-linked sensitivity loss at the cortical level. Crucially, we demonstrated that these results could be largely recovered using a structure-based retinotopic atlas, eliminating the need for pRF mapping and precise fixation - although such an approach reduced sensitivity. This approach, integrating large-field stimulation with a retinotopic atlas, offers a promising tool for monitoring vision loss and recovery in patients with various visual impairments, addressing a significant challenge in current clinical assessments.

">Quantification of the effect of hemodynamic occlusion in two-photon imaging</a></h4>

              
                The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of tools available to measure neuronal activity using fluorescence imaging (Chen et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2021). When performed in vivo, these measurements are invariably contaminated by hemodynamic occlusion artifacts. In widefield calcium imaging, this problem is well recognized. For two-photon imaging, however, the effects of hemodynamic occlusion have only been sparsely characterized. Here we perform a quantification of hemodynamic occlusion effects using measurements of fluorescence changes observed with GFP expression using both widefield and two-photon imaging. We find that in many instances the magnitude of signal changes attributable to hemodynamic occlusion is comparable to that observed with activity sensors. Moreover, we find that hemodynamic occlusion effects were spatially heterogeneous, both over cortical regions and across cortical depth, and exhibited a complex relationship with behavior. Thus, hemodynamic occlusion is an important caveat to consider when analyzing and interpreting not just widefield but also two-photon imaging data.

">Resistance of E2F4DN to p38MAPK phosphorylation attenuates DNA damage-induced neuronal death via Cited2</a></h4>

              
                E2F4, a transcription factor with a prominent role in cell homeostasis, can be phosphorylated by the stress kinase p38MAPK at the Thr248/Thr250 motif, while the Thr248Ala/Thr250Ala E2F4 mutant (E2F4DN) triggers multifactorial therapeutic effects in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that the mechanism of action of this therapy relays on the phosphorylation of the Thr248/Thr250 motif under stress conditions, which prevents the homeostatic function of E2F4, while exogenous E2F4DN expression can restore this function. To provide support to this hypothesis, we have focused on genotoxicity induced by camptothecin (CPT) in N2a neuroblastoma-derived neurons, as a paradigm of cell stress followed by cell death. Here we show that, in these cells, p38MAPK becomes activated 6 h after CPT treatment, followed by E2F4 phosphorylation in the Thr248/Thr250 motif. The effect of this phosphorylation in apoptosis was tested by overexpressing wild-type E2F4 (E2F4WT), its Thr248Glu/Thr250Glu phosphomimetic (E2F4CA) or E2F4DN in CPT-treated N2a neurons, followed by quantification of procaspase-3 cleavage. E2F1, which was used as a positive control, induced a statistically-significant increase of procaspase-3 cleavage 32 h after CPT treatment. This was mimicked by either E2F4WT or E2F4CA, while E2F4DN expression inhibited this effect through a Cited2-dependent mechanism. Pharmacological p38MAPK inhibition prevented cell death by E2F4WT but not by E2F4CA, confirming the requirement of E2F4 phosphorylation for cell death in these cells. We conclude that the phosphorylation of E2F4 facilitates the death of N2a neurons carrying DNA damage, while E2F4DN maintains the homeostatic function of E2F4 under stress conditions.

">Pup defence in lactating rats: The underlying neuropeptide signalling and their interactions in the nucleus accumbens shell</a></h4>

              
                Maternal aggression is a core feature of rodent maternal behaviour to defend their offspring from potential threats and is modulated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and oxytocin (OXT) systems signalling. Here, we investigated the involvement of those neuropeptide systems in maternal aggression within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a central region of the reward and maternal circuits. Infusion of CRF or Urocortin3 (CRF- receptor 2 agonist), as well as an OXT receptor antagonist, reduced maternal aggression, suggesting a role in pup defence. Furthermore, the effects of CRF infusion in the NAcSh continued beyond the maternal defence test (MDT), reducing nursing and increasing self- grooming. Corroborating the involvement of the stress system in maternal aggression, colocalization of CRF and cFos immunoreactive cells were increased in response to the MDT, regardless of pup presence. In addition, MDT exposure increased intra-NAc OXT release in lactating rats, which could be also triggered by local retrodialysis of CRF, but not Urocortin3. However, both ligands of the CRF system elicited dopamine (DA) release in different dynamics. Crh-r1 were predominantly expressed in the medial NAc on medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), but also in the rostral part on GABAergic interneurons. Crh-r2 were mainly expressed in the rostral NAc and its expression on GABAergic interneurons increased towards the caudal pole. Lastly, we identified CRF-enriched projections to the NAcSh descending from the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus, among others. In conclusion, intra-NAcSh dampened CRF system activity and enhanced OXT system transmission are indispensable for successful pup defence. Any perturbations like increased CRF system signalling might activate compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate maternal behaviour.

">Aging increases the distinctiveness of emotional brain states across rumination, worry, and positive thinking</a></h4>

              
                Emotional well-being improves with age, but how neural activity related to emotional brain states changes with aging remains unclear. This study examined individualized brain activation patterns for rumination, worry, and positive thinking to explore age-related variations in emotional state representation. Thirty-five participants (aged 18-64) recalled autobiographical events tied to these emotional states during fMRI scanning. Brain activity was analyzed using an individualized machine learning classifier. Results showed increased discriminability of rumination and worry with age, with older adults exhibiting heightened activation in cognitive control regions during rumination and reduced activation in the cingulate and temporoparietal junction during worry. No significant age-related changes were found for positive thinking, although increased discriminability between positive and negative states correlated with well-being (FDR < 0.05). These findings suggest that aging enhances cognitive control during rumination and reduces anxiety responses during worry, potentially contributing to improved emotional well-being in older adults.

">Dynamic imbalances in cell-type specific striatal ensemble activity during visually guided locomotion.</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion is continuously regulated by an animals position within an environment relative to goals. Direct and indirect pathway striatal output neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) influence locomotion, but how their activity is naturally coordinated by changing environments is unknown. We found, in head-fixed mice, that the relative balance of dSPN and iSPN activity was dynamically modulated with respect to position within a visually-guided locomotor trajectory to retrieve reward. Imbalances were present within ensembles of position-tuned SPNs which were sensitive to the visual environment. Our results suggest a model in which competitive imbalances in striatal output are created by learned associations with sensory input to shape context dependent locomotion.

">Task-irrelevant features in working memory alter current visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Higher-level cognition depends on visual working memory (VWM), the ability of our brain to maintain and manipulate internal representations of images that are no longer presented to us. An important question in this field is whether VWM is represented in a sensory or nonsensory manner. Progress has been made in understanding the features to be remembered, but the representational nature of the memory-irrelevant features is unclear. Here, we used a dual-task paradigm to investigate how and when the memory-irrelevant features interact with the concurrent visual information. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to perform a visual search task (Experiment 1) or a perceptual discrimination task (Experiments 2 and 3) involving a memory irrelevant feature while simultaneously holding the other feature for later retrieval. Experiment 1 showed that VWM biases the allocation of attention to color matching to the memory-irrelevant color. More importantly, the degree of VWM-biased attention decreased monotonically with decreasing feature similarity, and this behavioral monotonic gradient profile resembled the tuning curve of feature-selective neurons in the early visual cortex. Experiment 2 revealed that irrelevant features biased ongoing perception, as indicated by the shifted discrimination threshold. Experiment 3 further demonstrated that VWM-biased perception occurs only at short delays but not at prolonged delays. Our results suggest that the memory-irrelevant feature is represented as a sensory analog for a limited period of time in the visual areas where it was initially processed. Our results extend sensory recruitment theory to memory-irrelevant features in VWM.

                Despite being prevalent, the causes, mechanisms, and progression of epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder with unprovoked seizures, are not well understood, complicating drug development for treatment. This study used a comprehensive mouse epilepsy kindling model dataset to investigate frequency modulation (chirp) as a potential indicator of distinct states of epilepsy (early evoked discharge, late evoked discharge, spontaneous recurrent seizure, and drug state). Employing time-frequency ridge extraction, chirp identification, and statistical testing, our analyses revealed that chirp patterns occur in the majority of ictal discharges (>81.6%), persisting across evoked and spontaneous seizures. While the focus was on hippocampal recordings, chirps were also detected in the piriform peripheral cortex. Significant frequency and duration changes in chirp patterns during the transition from early to late evoked ictal events suggest their potential as the screening tool for seizure progression. Additionally, detailed analyses illuminate the impact of Lorazepam, a GABA A enhancer, on chirp characteristics, providing insights into how increased inhibitory tone quantifiably influences excitatory-inhibitory balances during seizures.

                Music-evoked nostalgia has the potential to assist in recalling autobiographical memories and enhancing well-being. However, nostalgic music preferences vary from person to person, presenting challenges for applying nostalgia-based music interventions in clinical settings, such as a non-pharmacological approach. To address these individual differences, we developed the Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI), a neurofeedback system that recommends nostalgic songs tailored to each individual. This system is based on prediction models of nostalgic feelings, developed by integrating subjective nostalgia ratings, acoustic features and in-ear electroencephalographic (EEG) data during song listening. To test the effects of N-BMI on nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory recall, seventeen elderly and seventeen young participants took part in the study. The N-BMI was personalized for each individual, and songs were recommended under two conditions: the "nostalgia condition", where songs were selected to enhance nostalgic feelings, and the "control condition", to reduce nostalgic feelings. We found nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory vividness were significantly higher after listening to the recommended songs in the nostalgia condition compared to the control condition in both groups. This indicates that the N-BMI enhanced nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory recall across both groups. The N-BMI paves the way for innovative therapeutic interventions, including non-pharmacological approaches.

Place cells in the hippocampus, named for their explicit encoding of position, are believed to be a neural substrate of these maps, with place cell "remapping" explaining how this system can represent different contexts. Briefly, place cells alter their firing properties, or "remap", in response to changes in experiential or sensory cues. Substantial sensory changes, produced, e.g., by moving between environments, cause large subpopulations of place cells to change their tuning entirely. While many studies have looked at the physiological basis of remapping, we lack explicit calculations of how the contextual capacity of the place cell system changes as a function of place field firing properties. Here, we propose a geometric approach to understanding population level activity of place cells. Using known firing field statistics, we investigate how changes to place cell firing properties affect the distances between representations of different environments within firing rate space. Using this approach, we find that the number of contexts storable by the hippocampus grows exponentially with the number of place cells, and calculate this exponent for environments of different sizes. We identify a fundamental trade-off between high resolution encoding of position and the number of storable contexts. This trade-off is tuned by place cell width, which might explain the change in firing field scale along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. We demonstrate that clustering of place cells near likely points of confusion, such as boundaries, increases the contextual capacity of the place system within our framework and conclude by discussing how our geometric approach could be extended to include other cell types and abstract spaces.

">Somatomotor disconnection links sleep duration with socioeconomic context, screen time, cognition, and psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sleep is critical for healthy brain development and emotional wellbeing, especially during adolescence when sleep, behavior, and neurobiology are rapidly evolving. Theoretical reviews and empirical research have historically focused on how sleep influences mental health through its impact on higher-order brain systems. No studies have leveraged data-driven network neuroscience methods to uncover interpretable, brain-wide signatures of sleep duration in adolescence, their socio-environmental origins, or their consequences for cognition and mental health. Methods: Here, we implement graph theory and component-based predictive modeling to examine how a multimodal index of sleep duration is associated with intrinsic brain architecture in 3,173 youth (11-12 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study. Results: We demonstrate that network integration/segregation exhibit a strong, generalizable multivariate association with sleep duration. We next identify a single component of brain architecture centered on a single network as the dominant contributor of this relationship. This component is characterized by increasing disconnection of a lower-order system - the somatomotor network - from other systems, with shorter sleep duration. Finally, greater somatomotor disconnection is associated with lower socioeconomic resources, longer screen times, reduced cognitive/academic performance, and elevated externalizing problems. Conclusions: These findings reveal a novel neural signature of shorter sleep in adolescence that is intertwined with environmental risk, cognition, and psychopathology. By robustly elucidating the key involvement of an understudied brain system in sleep, cognition, and psychopathology, this study can inform theoretical and translational research directions on sleep to promote neurobehavioral development and mental health during the adolescent transition.

">Distinct roles of brain network flexibility in motor learning across age</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning is a lifelong process, from infancy through old age. Acquiring new motor skills through repetitive practice requires adjusting motor output in response to sensory input and integrating them to facilitate learning. For this to occur, the central nervous system must flexibly predict and adapt to the dynamic interplay between sensory inputs and motor outputs. Although overall brain function changes with age, it remains unclear how neural flexibility evolves and influences motor learning ability with aging. To address this, we designed a motor learning paradigm involving both younger and older adults and quantitatively assessed neural flexibility from the perspective of functional brain networks, leveraging multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. Here we found age-related differences in motor learning properties, brain network flexibility, and their neural relationships. In younger adults, motor learning retention was associated with brain network flexibility during the preparatory period of the task. However, this association was not observed in older adults. Together, our findings establish that brain network flexibility plays a crucial role in acquiring and maintaining new motor skills in younger adults, but this relationship becomes less effective with age.

">Soft biocompatible polymer optical fiber tapers for implantable neural devices</a></h4>

              
                Optical fibers are between the most common implantable devices for delivering light in the nervous system for optogenetics and infrared neural stimulation applications. Tapered optical fibers, in particular, can offer homogeneous light delivery to a large volume and spatially resolved illumination compared to standard flat-cleaved fibers while being minimally invasive. However, the use of tapers for neural applications has up to now been limited to silica optical fibers, whose large Young's modulus can cause detrimental foreign body response in chronic settings. Here, we present the fabrication and optimization of tapered fiber implants based on polymer optical fibers (POFs). After numerically determining the optimal materials and taper geometry, we fabricated two types of POFs by thermal fiber drawing. The fabrication of the taper was achieved by chemical etching of the fibers, for which several solvents previously reported in literature have been tested. The influence of different parameters on the etching process and on the quality of the obtained tapers was also investigated. The large illumination volume of the produced high-quality taper-based implants was finally tested in vitro in a brain phantom.

">Ephrin-mediated dendrite-dendrite repulsion regulates compartment- specific targeting of dendrites in the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Neurons often forms synaptic contacts at specific subcellular domains to differentially regulate the activity of target neurons. However, how dendrites are targeted to specific subcellular domains of axons is rarely studied. Here we use Drosophila mushroom body out neurons (MBONs) and local dopaminergic neurons (DANs) as a model system to study how dendrites and axons are targeted to specific subcellular domains (compartments) of mushroom body axonal lobes to form synaptic contacts. We found that Ephrin-mediated dendrite- dendrite repulsion between neighboring compartments restricts the projection of MBON dendrites to their specific compartments and prevents the formation of ectopic synaptic connections with DAN axons in neighboring compartments. Meanwhile, DAN neurons in a subset of compartments may also depend on their partner MBONs for projecting their axons to a specific compartment and cover the same territory as their partner MBON dendrites. Our work reveals that compartment-specific targeting of MBON dendrites and DAN axons is regulated in part by a combination of dendrite-dendrite repulsion between neighboring compartments and dendrite-axon interactions within the same compartment.

">Intra-arterial Deoxyribonuclease therapy improves stroke outcomes in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Futile recanalization affects more than half of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a major factor of microvascular hypoperfusion after stroke. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) targeting NETs exhibited a neuroprotective effect in young mice with AIS. This study explored a novel direct intra-arterial administration of DNase therapy and its effect in aged mice with AIS. Method: AIS was induced in aged C57BL/6 mice followed by reperfusion and immediate, intra-arterial DNase administration via the internal carotid artery. Cerebral blood flow, neurological function, cerebral infarct volume, and NET markers were examined. Results: Direct intra-arterial DNase therapy significantly increased cerebral blood flow, reduced neurological deficit scores, increased the latency to fall in wire hang test, reduced cerebral infarct volume, and decreased neutrophil and NET count in both the parenchyma and micro vessels in aged mice with AIS compared with age-matched, vehicle controls. Conclusion: Our data is the first to demonstrate that successful, direct intra-arterial DNase therapy provides more efficient cerebral reperfusion and better outcomes after recanalization during the treatment of large vessel occlusion in aged mice. This study provides evidence for the potential clinical application of catheter delivered intra-arterial DNase therapy post-recanalization.

">How relevant is the prior? Bayesian causal inference for dynamic perception in volatile environments</a></h4>

              
                Our brains predict future sensory input based on their current beliefs about the world around us, but interpreting prediction errors can be challenging in a volatile environment because they can be caused by stochastic noise or by outdated predictions. Noisy signals should be integrated with prior beliefs to improve precision, but the two should be segregated when environmental changes render prior beliefs irrelevant. Bayesian inference provides a statistically optimal solution to deal with situations in which there is uncertainty about the cause of the prediction errors. However, the method quickly becomes memory intensive and computationally intractable when applied consecutively. Here, we systematically evaluate the predictive performance of Bayesian causal inference for human perceptual decisions in a spatial prediction task based on noisy audiovisual sequences with occasional changepoints. We elucidate the simplifying assumptions of a previously proposed reduced Bayesian observer model, and we compare it to an extensive set of models based on alternative simplification strategies. Model-free analyses revealed the hallmarks of Bayesian causal inference: participants seem to have integrated sensory evidence with prior beliefs to improve accuracy when prediction errors were small, and prior influence gradually decreased as prediction errors grew larger, signalling probable irrelevance of the prior due to a changepoint. Model comparison results further supported the hypotheses that participants computed probability-weighted averages over the causal options (noise or changepoint) and that they iteratively summarized their beliefs while accounting for causal uncertainty akin to the reduced Bayesian observer model. However, we also found that participants' reliance on prior beliefs was systematically smaller than predicted by the model, and this was best explained by individually fitting lower-than-optimal parameters for the a-priori probability of prior relevance. We conclude that perceptual belief updating in volatile environments with stochastic noise is well described by a simplified model of consecutive Bayesian causal inference. Observers utilize priors flexibly to the extent that they are deemed relevant, though also conservatively with a lower tendency to bind than an ideal Bayesian observer.

">Neurodegeneration impairs the consolidation of developmentally synchronized behavioral patterns</a></h4>

              
                Animals generate predictable patterns of behavior that are robustly synchronized with the developmental clock. However, the long-term establishment of time-locked behaviors across development, and the neuronal alterations that may impair them, remain underexplored. Here, by quantifying the temporal synchronization of behavior in multiple isolated C. elegans individuals throughout their complete development time, we show that robust behavioral synchronization consolidates across stages as development progresses. Analyses of multiple mutant populations with perturbed neuronal function or structure reveal that neurodegeneration in specific circuits impairs the developmental organization of behavior. In one of the cases, protection from neurodegeneration of the circuit of touch receptor neurons restored normal modes of long-term behavior. Moreover, at the neuronal activity level, we found altered activity patterns in downstream motor neurons following neurodegeneration. These results suggest the impairment of developmental patterns of synchronized behavior by localized neurodegenerative processes within the nervous system.

                Neuroinflammation is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigational and FDA approved drugs targeting inflammation already exist, thus drug repurposing for AD is a suitable approach. BT-11 is an investigational drug that reduces inflammation in the gut and improves cognitive function. BT-11 is orally active and binds to lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), a glutathione-s-transferase, thus potentially reducing oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of BT-11 long-term treatment on the TgF344-AD rat model. BT-11 reduced hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits, A{beta} plaque load and neuronal loss in males, and mitigated microglia numbers in females. BT-11 treatment led to hippocampal transcriptomic changes in signaling receptor, including G-protein coupled receptor pathways. We detected LANCL2 in hippocampal nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with potential different post-translational modifications, suggesting distinct functions based on its subcellular localization. LANCL2 was present in oligodendrocytes, showing a role in oligodendrocyte function. To our knowledge, these last two findings have not been reported. Overall, our data suggest that targeting LANCL2 with BT-11 improves cognition and reduces AD-like pathology by potentially modulating G-protein signaling and oligodendrocyte function. Our studies contribute to the field of novel immunomodulatory AD therapeutics, and merit further research on the role of LANCL2 in this disease.

">Neural dynamics in the orbitofrontal cortex reveal cognitive strategies</a></h4>

              
                Behavior is sloppy: a multitude of cognitive strategies can produce similar behavioral read-outs. An underutilized approach is to combine multifaceted behavioral analyses with neural recordings to resolve cognitive strategies. Here we show that rats performing a decision-making task exhibit distinct strategies over training, and these cognitive strategies are decipherable from orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neural dynamics. We trained rats to perform a temporal wagering task with hidden reward states. While naive rats passively adapted to reward statistics, expert rats inferred reward states. Electrophysiological recordings and novel methods for characterizing population dynamics identified latent neural factors that reflected inferred states in expert but not naive rats. In experts, these factors showed abrupt changes following single trials that were informative of state transitions. These dynamics were driven by neurons whose firing rates reflected single trial inferences, and OFC inactivations showed they were causal to behavior. These results reveal the neural signatures of inference.

">Altricial brains and the evolution of infant vocal learning</a></h4>

              
                Human infant vocal development is strongly influenced by interactions with caregivers who reinforce more speech-like sounds. This trajectory of vocal development in humans is radically different from those of our close phylogenetic relatives, Old World monkeys and apes. In these primates most closely related to humans on the evolutionary tree, social feedback plays no significant role in their vocal development. Oddly, infant marmoset monkeys, a more distantly related New World primate, do exhibit socially guided vocal learning. To explore what developmental mechanism could have evolved to account for these behavioral differences, we hypothesized that the evolution of human and marmoset vocal learning in early infancy in both species is because they are born neurally altricial relative to other primate and in a cooperative breeding social environment. Our analysis found that, indeed, human and marmoset brain are growing faster at birth when compared with chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, making them altricial relative to these primates. We formalized our hypothesis using a logistic growth model showing that the maturation of a system dependent on the rate of brain growth and the amount of social stimuli benefits from an altricial brain and a cooperative breeding environment. Our data suggest that in primates, the evolution of socially guided vocal learning during early infancy in humans and marmosets was afforded by infants with a relatively altricial brain and behavior, sustained and stimulated by cooperative breeding environments.

">Activity-dependent extracellular proteolytic cascade remodels ECM to promote structural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The brain's perineuronal extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial factor in maintaining the stability of mature brain circuitry. However, how is activity-induced synaptic plasticity achieved in the adult brain with a dense ECM? We hypothesized that neuronal activity induces cleavage of ECM components, creating space for synaptic rearrangements. To test this hypothesis, we investigated neuronal activity-dependent proteolytic cleavage of brevican, a prototypical perineuronal ECM proteoglycan, and its importance of this process for functional and structural synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus ex vivo. Our findings revealed that chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) triggers a rapid brevican cleavage through the activation of an extracellular proteolytic cascade involving proprotein convertases and ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. This process is dependent on NMDA receptors and requires astrocytes. Interestingly, the extracellular full-length brevican increases upon cLTP, indicating a simultaneous secretion of ECM components. Interfering with cLTP-induced brevican cleavage did not impact the early LTP but prevented formation of new dendritic protrusions. Collectively, these results reveal a mechanism of activity-dependent ECM remodeling and suggest that ECM degradation is essential for structural synaptic plasticity.

">Mu opioid receptor expression by nucleus accumbens inhibitory interneurons promotes affiliative social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Mu opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens regulate motivated behavior, including pursuit of natural rewards like social interaction as well as exogenous opioids. We used a suite of genetic and viral strategies to conditionally delete mu opioid receptor expression from all major neuron types in the nucleus accumbens. We pinpoint inhibitory interneurons as an essential site of mu opioid receptor expression for typical social behavior, independent from exogenous opioid sensitivity.

	<p>Background: The dopaminergic theory, the oldest and most comprehensively analyzed neurotransmitter theory of schizophrenia, remains a focal point of research. Methods: This systematic review examines the association between combinations of 14 dopaminergic genes and the risk of schizophrenia. The selected genes include dopamine receptors (DRD1&amp;amp;ndash;5), metabolizing enzymes (COMT, MAOA, MAOB, DBH), synthesizing enzymes (TH, DDC), and dopamine transporters (DAT, VMAT1, and VMAT2). Results: Recurring functional patterns show combinations with either hyperdopaminergic effects in limbic and striatal regions or high striatal and low prefrontal dopamine levels. The protective statuses of certain alleles or genotypes are often maintained in epistatic effects; however, exceptions exist. This complexity could explain the inconsistent results in previous genetic studies. Investigating individual alleles may be insufficient due to the heterozygous advantage observed in some studies. Conclusions: Schizophrenia may not be a monolithic disease, but rather a sum of different phenotypes which respond uniquely to different treatment and prevention approaches.</p>

	<p>Background: The localization of seizure onset zones (SOZs) is a critical step before the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Methods and Results: In this paper, we propose an SOZ detection method based on convolutional neural networks and EEG signals. This method aims to locate SOZs through the seizure status of each channel in multi-channel EEG signals. First, we preprocess the data with filtering, segmentation, resampling, and standardization to ensure their quality and consistency. Then, the single-channel UCI epilepsy seizure recognition dataset is used to train and test the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, achieving an accuracy of 98.70%, a sensitivity of 97.53%, and a specificity of 98.98%. Next, the multi-channel clinical EEG dataset collected by a hospital is divided into 21 single-channel site datasets and input into the model for detection, and then the seizure results of 21 sites per second are obtained. Finally, the seizure sites are visualized through the international 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system electrode distribution map, diagrams of the change process of the seizure sites during seizures are drawn, and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; SOZs are located. Conclusions: Our proposed method well classifies seizure and non-seizure data and successfully locates SOZs by detecting the seizure results of 21 sites through a single-channel model. This study can effectively assist doctors in locating the SOZs of patients and provide help for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic adults exhibit core and comorbid features that can have an impact on their daily functioning and lead to considerable psychological distress. Significant and consistent associations have been identified between autism characteristics&amp;amp;mdash;restricted repetitive behaviors and sensory features&amp;amp;mdash;and high levels of stress and anxiety. For a better understanding of the issue, it is necessary to consider the cognitive aspects that can help explain variations in stress and anxiety levels among adults with autism. We therefore aimed to model the contributions of worry and intolerance of uncertainty on the relationship between autism characteristics (sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors) and psychological distress (stress and anxiety). Methods: The sample comprised 144 autistic individuals with a mean age of 35.15 (SD = 11.44). They participated in the study by completing an online questionnaire to assess the study variables. Most of the participants reported being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (63.6%) or Level 1 autism spectrum disorder (27.1%). Results: The model fit index values tested through path analysis indicated a good fit (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 5.65; p = 0.13 ns; CFI = 0.993; NFI = 0.985; RMSEA = 0.079; SRMR = 0.025) and identified worry and intolerance of uncertainty as significant mediating variables within a comprehensive explanatory model. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of worry and intolerance of uncertainty as specific targets in interventions aimed at improving stress and anxiety problems in autistic adults.</p>

	<p>Background: The single-channel sleep EEG has the advantages of convenient collection, high-cost performance, and easy daily use, and it has been widely used in the classification of sleep stages. Methods: This paper proposes a single-channel sleep EEG classification method based on long short-term memory and a hidden Markov model (LSTM-HMM). First, the single-channel EEG is decomposed using wavelet transform (WT), and multi-domain features are extracted from the component signals to characterize the EEG characteristics fully. Considering the temporal nature of sleep stage changes, this paper uses a multi-step time series as the input for the model. After that, the multi-step time series features are input into the LSTM. Finally, the HMM improves the classification results, and the final prediction results are obtained. Results: A complete experiment was conducted on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. The results show that the proposed method can extract deep information from EEG and make full use of the sleep stage transition rule. The proposed method shows the best performance in single-channel sleep EEG classification; the accuracy, macro average F1 score, and kappa are 82.71%, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed method can realize single-channel sleep EEG classification and provide a reference for other EEG classifications.</p>

	<p>Background: The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are very rare lysosomal diseases. MPSs belong to inherited diseases; however, newborns are usually asymptomatic. A deficiency of one of the enzymes, which is responsible for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) catabolism, results in the accumulation of this material. GAGs lead to progressive damage to tissues. More than 90% of patients with MPS suffer from otitis media with effusion or recurrent otitis media, craniofacial dysmorphia, obstructive sleep apnea, different types of hearing loss, and progressive upper and lower airway dysfunction. Patients visit otolaryngologists often before the diagnosis of MPS. Thus, the awareness of symptoms of MPS is crucial for otolaryngologists and pediatricians. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the more effective treatment is. Ineffective or delayed treatment leads to premature death. Two principal treatments for MPS are currently available: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in gene therapy as a potential treatment for patients with MPS. Mortality in patients with MPS typically occurs during childhood and early adolescence as a consequence of upper and lower respiratory diseases. Methods: This systematic review is based on papers available in the following scientific databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Results: After screening, 72 articles met our inclusion criteria. Conclusions: It is of paramount importance that otolaryngologists are involved in this field. This narrative review examines and synthesizes the otolaryngologic issues encountered in patients with MPS.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep is one of the most essential processes for sustaining cognitive, emotional, and physical health across all age groups. Insomnia or inadequate sleep significantly impacts health and poses economic burdens due to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity. Objectives and Methods: This study aimed to investigate sleep quality in the Romanian active population using an online survey incorporating the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Conducted over four months in 2023, the survey gathered 2243 complete responses from urban and rural residents over the age of 18. Results: The results highlight gender and urban&amp;amp;ndash;rural disparities in sleep quality, revealing that females and urban residents experienced poorer sleep compared to their counterparts. Additionally, sleep quality was found to significantly worsen with age, with elders (56+ years) reporting the highest PSQI scores, indicating greater sleep difficulties compared to middle-aged adults and youngsters. A high prevalence of sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunctions, and sleep medication use was reported. Common pre-sleep activities included using electronic devices and watching TV, while fewer participants engaged in reading books or consuming alcohol and caffeine. Additionally, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; bedding preferences were documented. Conclusions: Our study highlights the influence of various factors on sleep quality and emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions to improve sleep health in Romania.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Since the Act for Eliminating Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities was enacted in 2016, the number of students with disabilities in higher education institutions has increased significantly, creating a greater need for support. Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) often coexists with other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and reading and writing difficulties; yet, awareness of DCD remains low. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of DCD traits among Japanese higher education students and their relationship with ADHD, ASD, and reading and writing support needs Methods: A pilot study was conducted with 77 university students (mean age: 19.17 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.68) in the Kansai region, using the Adolescents and Adults Coordination Questionnaire (AAC-Q) to screen for DCD traits, along with a questionnaire assessing difficulties related to ADHD and ASD, and a survey on reading and writing support needs. Results: The study found that 12.9% of students scored more than 1 standard deviation above the mean on the AAC-Q. Students in the DCD trait group (n = 10) reported greater difficulties related to ADHD and ASD than those in the non-DCD group (n = 67). Correlation analysis revealed a moderate-to-strong association between AAC-Q scores and difficulties related to ADHD and ASD among students in the DCD trait group. Conclusions: This study suggests the need to raise awareness about DCD traits and to provide comprehensive support for students with ADHD and ASD in Japanese higher education institutions.</p>

	<p>Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21 or T21) and is associated with an increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), also known as DS-associated AD (DSAD). Individuals with DS typically develop amyloid neuropathology in their late-thirties to early-forties and the mean age of onset of clinical dementia is approximately 55 years. Recent advances in AD clinical research have focused on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques as a potential therapeutic approach. Therefore, there has been guarded enthusiasm about using anti-amyloid mAbs in the prevention/treatment of DSAD. This narrative review and perspective explores the current understanding of amyloid pathology in AD and DSAD, the rationale for using anti-amyloid mAbs in the treatment of DSAD, and the challenges and opportunities for research toward the application of this therapeutic strategy to older adults with DS.</p>

	<p>Background: Speech production is a possible way to monitor bulbar and respiratory functions in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, the emergence of smartphone-based data collection offers a promising approach to reduce frequent hospital visits and enhance patient outcomes. Here, we studied the relationship between bulbar and respiratory functions with voice characteristics of ALS patients, alongside a speech therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s evaluation, at the convenience of using a simple smartphone. Methods: For voice assessment, we considered a speech therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s standardized tool&amp;amp;mdash;consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice (CAPE-V); and an acoustic analysis toolbox. The bulbar sub-score of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) was used, and pulmonary function measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC%), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP%), and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP%). Correlation coefficients and both linear and logistic regression models were applied. Results: A total of 27 ALS patients (12 males; 61 years mean age; 28 months median disease duration) were included. Patients with significant bulbar dysfunction revealed greater CAPE-V scores in overall severity, roughness, strain, pitch, and loudness. They also presented slower speaking rates, longer pauses, and higher jitter values in acoustic analysis (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The CAPE-V&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall severity and sub-scores for pitch and loudness demonstrated significant correlations with MIP% and MEP% (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, acoustic metrics (speaking rate, absolute energy, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio) significantly correlated with FVC% (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The results provide supporting evidence for the use of smartphone-based recordings in ALS patients for CAPE-V and acoustic analysis as reliable correlates of bulbar and respiratory function.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Childhood maltreatment has been linked to numerous adverse outcomes in adulthood, including problem substance use. However, not all individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment develop substance use problems, indicating the role of other factors in influencing this outcome. Past work suggests that adverse early life experiences, including childhood maltreatment, lead to neurobiological changes in frontolimbic functions that, in turn, result in altered stress and reward responses, heightened impulsivity, affect dysregulation, and, ultimately, increased risk for maladaptive behaviors such as substance use. The aim of this preliminary investigation using cross-sectional data was to test associations between these factors in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use problems in a sample of emerging adults. Methods: Emerging adults (18&amp;amp;ndash;30 years old) who identified as regular drinkers (i.e., drinking at least 2&amp;amp;ndash;4 times in the past month) were recruited from a crowd-sourcing platform (Prolific) as well as community samples. Participants completed online standardized questionnaires assessing reward sensitivity and responsiveness, impulsivity, emotion regulation, and alcohol consequences. Results: Path analyses demonstrated good fit for the data (SRMR = 0.057, RMSEA = 0.096, 90% CI [0.055, 0.142], CFI = 0.957). Childhood maltreatment was associated with reward responsiveness (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.026, Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.222, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and emotion dysregulation (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.669, Z = 9.633, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), which in turn was associated with urgency and, subsequently, alcohol consequences (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.758, Z = 7.870, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Although these findings are preliminary, the current study is one of the first to test a comprehensive model addressing the relationship between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use problems. The findings have the potential to inform treatment strategies that target motivation and goal-directed action for reducing and managing consequences associated with childhood maltreatment. Future research should test the model using longitudinal data to address the limitations of a cross-sectional study and assess temporal associations between constructs.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; intention understanding ability reflects their professional insight, which is the basis for effective classroom teaching activities. However, the cognitive process and brain mechanism of how teachers understand students&amp;amp;rsquo; action intention in class are still unclear. Methods: This study used event-related potential (ERP) technology to explore the cognitive neural differences in intention understanding ability among teachers with different levels of knowledge and experience. The experiment used the comic strips paradigm to examine the ability of expert and novice teachers to understand students&amp;amp;rsquo; normative and non-normative classroom actions under different text prompts (&amp;amp;ldquo;how&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;why&amp;amp;rdquo;). Results: The results revealed that in the late time window, expert teachers induced larger P300 and LPC amplitudes when they understood students&amp;amp;rsquo; classroom action intentions, while the N250 amplitudes induced by novice teachers in the early time window were significantly larger. In addition, for both types of teachers, when understanding the intentions behind students&amp;amp;rsquo; normative actions, the N250 amplitude was the most significant, while the P300 and LPC amplitudes were more significant for non-normative actions. Conclusions: This study found that teachers at varying professional development stages had different time processing processes in intention understanding ability, which supported teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; brain electrophysiological activities related to social ability.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of long-term music training (i.e., musicianship) on the neural processing of sound, including simple tones and speech. However, the effects of musicianship on the encoding of simultaneously presented pitches, in the form of complex musical chords, is less well established. Presumably, musicians&amp;amp;rsquo; stronger familiarity and active experience with tonal music might enhance harmonic pitch representations, perhaps in an attention-dependent manner. Additionally, attention might influence chordal encoding differently across the auditory system. To this end, we explored the effects of long-term music training and attention on the processing of musical chords at the brainstem and cortical levels. Method: Young adult participants were separated into musician and nonmusician groups based on the extent of formal music training. While recording EEG, listeners heard isolated musical triads that differed only in the chordal third: major, minor, and detuned (4% sharper third from major). Participants were asked to correctly identify chords via key press during active stimulus blocks and watched a silent movie during passive blocks. We logged behavioral identification accuracy and reaction times and calculated information transfer based on the behavioral chord confusion patterns. EEG data were analyzed separately to distinguish between cortical (event-related potential, ERP) and subcortical (frequency-following response, FFR) evoked responses. Results: We found musicians were (expectedly) more accurate, though not faster, than nonmusicians in chordal identification. For subcortical FFRs, responses showed stimulus chord effects but no group differences. However, for cortical ERPs, whereas musicians displayed P2 (~150 ms) responses that were invariant to attention, nonmusicians displayed reduced P2 during passive listening. Listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; degree of behavioral information transfer (i.e., success in distinguishing chords) was also better in musicians and correlated with their neural differentiation of chords in the ERPs (but not high-frequency FFRs). Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest long-term music training strengthens even the passive cortical processing of musical sounds, supporting more automated brain processing of musical chords with less reliance on attention. Our results also suggest that the degree to which listeners can behaviorally distinguish chordal triads is directly related to their neural specificity to musical sounds primarily at cortical rather than subcortical levels. FFR attention effects were likely not observed due to the use of high-frequency stimuli (&amp;amp;gt;220 Hz), which restrict FFRs to brainstem sources.</p>

     alt="A Novel Mouse Model for Cerebral Inflammatory Demyelination in X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy: Insights into Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Targets"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Over 500 million people worldwide rely on sorghum as a main food crop. About 10% of the daily caloric intake of households in Ethiopia’s northwest and eastern regions, including Benishangul Gumuz, comes from sorghum. A hemi-biotrophic fungal pathogen called Colletotrichum sublineolum caused anthracnose disease is among the biotic constraints of sorghum production. Methods Ten selected sorghum genotypes were assessed for sorghum anthracnose severity and its temporal and spatial dynamics on field plots in the districts of Assosa and Bambasi. The performance of the chosen sorghum genotypes was assessed using the following metrics: AUDPC, disease progress rate, yield-related trait, sorghum grain yield, and mean severity index. Anthracnose severity was evaluated using a 1–5 disease rating scale and assessments conducted at seven consecutive time points. Results Ten genotypes of sorghum were examined in the districts of Assosa and Bambasi, with mean anthracnose severity index ranging from 60-77 PSI and 53-82 PSI, respectively. AUDPC varied from 351 to 470 % days and 316 to 499 % days at Assosa and Bambasi districts, respectively. Bambasi district achieved a larger grain yield than the Assosa district. Assosa-1 demonstrated a significant level of disease pressure, yet the current investigation found that this genotype is the highest performing genotype in both locations. Conclusions There is a considerable positive link between the severity of anthracnose and the weekly total rainfall and relative humidity. At both trial sites, Mersa-1 continuously produced higher grain yields and reduced disease levels. Breeders might utilize the Baco Striga sorghum genotype as a check line in a breeding effort to resist anthracnose disease because it shown a high vulnerability to the disease at both locations.

                Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (Chittodvega) is one among many types of mental disorders explained in Ayurveda. It can be defined as a Chitta (mind) + Udvega (anxiety)= Chittodvega- Anxious status of a mind. Celastrus paniculatus also known as Jyotishmati stimulates and improves the digestive fire and metabolism at a cellular level (Jatharagni and Majja dhatwagni). It can be correlated to GAD. GAD is characterized by feelings of threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and tension, and symptoms such as palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. It affects women more frequently than men and prevalence rates are high in midlife (prevalence in females over age 35: 10%) and older subjects. In modern medicine the first-line psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline (SNRIs). Aim and objectives To evaluate the comparative efficacy of Jyotishmati versus sertraline in the management of Chittodvega. Methods In this randomized active controlled double blind equivalence trial a total of 70 patients will be enrolled and divided into two equal groups. Patients between 20–50 years age of either gender having symptoms of Chittodvega and a Hamilton anxiety rating (HAM-A) scale score less than 24 (i.e., mild to moderate) will be selected for the study. In Group A, sertraline capsules 25 mg for first 7 days and then dose increased to 50 mg at bedtime for next 53 days and in Group B Jyotishmati Capsules 500 mg will be given twice a day after food with water for 60 days. Result and observation The patients will be assessed on the HAM-A scale, serum cortisol and WHO Quality of Life on day 0, 30, 60 and 90 and data will be analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables to evaluate whether treatments are equivalent.

                Abstract Background In the 21st century, the recognition of the rights and needs of victims of sexual violence has emerged as a fundamental discourse within international, regional, and local policy agendas. This has been influenced by the lasting psychological, emotional, and physical effects of sexual violence on the victims. These commentaries and agitation have spurred the need for alternative ways in which the Nigerian criminal justice system can be strengthened by incorporating criminal justice mechanisms and interventions that would enhance the needs and interests of victims in accessing justice despite its adversarial system of justice. Methods This study aims to appraise the different mechanisms of justice, needs, and interests of victims of sexual violence through a theoretical lens and drawing lessons from South Africa and Australia. To achieve this work, a doctrinal research methodology that utilized existing literature and secondary sources such as textbooks and online websites was adopted. Results The study found that there is a need for accountability for the protection of victims, implementation of legislation, and scaling up of resources for effective support services. In addition, the absence of resources, effective monitoring and compliance institutions, monitoring reports, specialized courts, and special regulations hampers the implementation of a victim-centered approach. Among others, the study recommends an all-inclusive criminal justice mechanism that would further incorporate a victim-centered approach towards advancing the rights and quality of justice for victims of Sexual Violence and the need for a victim impact statement to our criminal justice system for cases of sexual violence. Conclusion The study concludes that there is a need to make provisions for more effective alternative responses to incorporate the justice interests and needs of victims of sexual violence.

                Background Ovarian pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy, accounting for 0.5% to 1% of all ectopic pregnancies, with an incidence ranging from 1 in 2,100 to 1 in 60,000 pregnancies. Due to its rarity and the lack of common risk factors, diagnosing ovarian pregnancy is often challenging and typically occurs during surgical exploration. Case Presentation We present the case of a 40-year-old woman who experienced severe pelvic pain, light vaginal bleeding, and 8 weeks of amenorrhea. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was hemodynamically unstable, with low blood pressure and a rapid heart rate. An ultrasound revealed an empty uterus, an irregular mass on her right ovary, and free fluid in the pelvis. Her beta-hCG level was elevated, and her hemoglobin level was low. Given the suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy, she underwent emergency surgery. During the operation, the surgical team discovered a large amount of clotted blood and a ruptured mass on her left ovary measuring 10 x 9.5 cm. Due to heavy bleeding, they performed a left oophorectomy and salpingectomy. Histopathological analysis later confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy. Conclusion This case underscores the challenges in diagnosing ovarian pregnancy and highlights the necessity for prompt surgical intervention, particularly in unstable patients. Early detection and appropriate management are critical to prevent life-threatening complications.

                <p>by Saishi Cui, Sina Nassiri, Issa Zakeri</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis faces numerous challenges, including high sparsity, a high-dimensional feature space, and biological noise. These challenges hinder downstream analysis, necessitating the use of feature selection methods to identify informative genes, and reduce data dimensionality. However, existing methods for selecting highly variable genes (HVGs) exhibit limited overlap and inconsistent clustering performance across benchmark datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle to accurately select HVGs from fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and minority cell types, which are more difficult to distinguish, raising concerns about the reliability of their results. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel feature selection framework for scRNA-seq data called Mcadet. Mcadet integrates Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), graph-based community detection, and a novel statistical testing approach. To assess the effectiveness of Mcadet, we conducted extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world data, employing unbiased metrics for comparison. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of Mcadet in the selection of HVGs in scenarios involving fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and datasets containing minority cell populations. Overall, we demonstrate that Mcadet enhances the reliability of selected HVGs, although the impact of HVG selection on various downstream analyses varies and needs to be further investigated.

                <p>by Jiamu Jiang, Emilie Foyardg, Mark C. W. van Rossumg</p>

Synaptic plasticity enables animals to adapt to their environment, but memory formation can require a substantial amount of metabolic energy, potentially impairing survival. Hence, a neuro-economic dilemma arises whether learning is a profitable investment or not, and the brain must therefore judiciously regulate learning. Indeed, in experiments it was observed that during starvation, Drosophila suppress formation of energy-intensive aversive memories. Here we include energy considerations in a reinforcement learning framework. Simulated flies learned to avoid noxious stimuli through synaptic plasticity in either the energy expensive long-term memory (LTM) pathway, or the decaying anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) pathway. The objective of the flies is to maximize their lifespan, which is calculated with a hazard function. We find that strategies that switch between the LTM and ARM pathways, based on energy reserve and reward prediction error, prolong lifespan. Our study highlights the significance of energy-regulation of memory pathways and dopaminergic control for adaptive learning and survival. It might also benefit engineering applications of reinforcement learning under resources constraints.

                <p>by Mark C. W. van Rossum, Aaron Pache</p>

The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation, but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories. Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates, already carries a significant metabolic cost. Yet, learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to require at least 10<sup>8</sup> synaptic updates. Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1) only modify synapses with large updates, and 2) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires, yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses. In particular in this case, large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity. The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly.

Establishing suitable <i>in vitro</i> culture conditions for microorganisms is crucial for dissecting their biology and empowering potential applications. However, a significant number of bacterial and fungal species, including <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i>, remain unculturable, hampering research efforts. <i>P</i>. <i>jirovecii</i> is a deadly pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite the major impact of <i>Pneumocystis</i> on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus. This is largely due to the fact that its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism <i>in vitro</i>. We present a comprehensive <i>in silico</i> genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Pneumocystis</i> growth and metabolism, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth <i>in vitro</i>. We utilise recently published genome data and available information in the literature as well as bioinformatics and software tools to develop and validate the model. In addition, we employ relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the <i>Pneumocystis</i> growth medium. Our findings offer insights into the biology of <i>Pneumocystis</i> and provide a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen <i>in vitro</i>.

Epidemiological delays are key quantities that inform public health policy and clinical practice. They are used as inputs for mathematical and statistical models, which in turn can guide control strategies. In recent work, we found that censoring, right truncation, and dynamical bias were rarely addressed correctly when estimating delays and that these biases were large enough to have knock-on impacts across a large number of use cases. Here, we formulate a checklist of best practices for estimating and reporting epidemiological delays. We also provide a flowchart to guide practitioners based on their data. Our examples are focused on the incubation period and serial interval due to their importance in outbreak response and modeling, but our recommendations are applicable to other delays. The recommendations, which are based on the literature and our experience estimating epidemiological delay distributions during outbreak responses, can help improve the robustness and utility of reported estimates and provide guidance for the evaluation of estimates for downstream use in transmission models or other analyses.

                <p>by Raúl A. Reyes Hueros, Rodrigo A. Gier, Sydney M. Shaffer</p>

Individual cells grown in culture exhibit remarkable differences in their growth, with some cells capable of forming large clusters, while others are limited or fail to grow at all. While these differences have been observed across cell lines and human samples, the growth dynamics and associated cell states remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed clonal tracing through imaging and cellular barcoding of an in vitro model of esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT). We found that about 10% of clones grow exponentially, while the remaining have cells that become non-proliferative leading to a halt in the growth rate. Using mathematical models, we demonstrate two distinct growth behaviors: exponential and logistic. Further, we discovered that the propensity to grow exponentially is largely heritable through four doublings and that the less proliferative clones can become highly proliferative through increasing plating density. Combining barcoding with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified the cellular states associated with the highly proliferative clones, which include genes in the WNT and PI3K pathways. Finally, we identified an enrichment of cells resembling the highly proliferative cell state in the proliferating healthy human esophageal epithelium.

                <p>by Haolin Jiang, Yulian Xu, Yunguang Tong, Dong Zhang, Ruhong Zhou</p>

As an emerging class of RNA molecules, circular RNAs play pivotal roles in various biological processes, thereby determining their three-dimensional (3D) structure is crucial for a deep understanding of their biological significances. Similar to linear RNAs, the development of computational methods for circular RNA 3D structure prediction is challenging, especially considering the inherent flexibility and potentially long length of circular RNAs. Here, we introduce an extension of our previous IsRNA2 model, named IsRNAcirc, to enable circular RNA 3D structure predictions through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The workflow of IsRNAcirc consists of four main steps, including input preparation, end closure, structure prediction, and model refinement. Our results demonstrate that IsRNAcirc can provide reasonable 3D structure predictions for circular RNAs, which significantly reduce the locally irrational elements contained in the initial input. Moreover, for a validation test set comprising 34 circular RNAs, our IsRNAcirc can generate 3D models with better scores than the template-based 3dRNA method. These findings demonstrate that our IsRNAcirc method is a promising tool to explore the structural details along with intricate interactions of circular RNAs.

The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents. The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems. In a few cases, the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles, or the enzymatic behaviour of <i>de novo</i> proteins. Usually, however, while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors, it typically cannot be changed at will. Here, we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish. We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally. In particular, we probe the effect of the lack of <i>col11a2</i> gene in zebrafish, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. The resulting <i>col11a2 -/-</i> zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and <i>col11a2 -/-</i> zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. In this way, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system, changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model.

                <p>by Emma C. Gordon, Anil K. Seth</p>

Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external computers, allowing processing of brain activity and the ability to control external devices. While often used for medical purposes, BCIs may also hold great promise for nonmedical purposes to unlock human neurocognitive potential. In this Essay, we discuss the prospects and challenges of using BCIs for cognitive enhancement, focusing specifically on invasive enhancement BCIs (eBCIs). We discuss the ethical, legal, and scientific implications of eBCIs, including issues related to privacy, autonomy, inequality, and the broader societal impact of cognitive enhancement technologies. We conclude that the development of eBCIs raises challenges far beyond practical pros and cons, prompting fundamental questions regarding the nature of conscious selfhood and about who—and what—we are, and ought, to be.

Animals guide their behaviors through internal representations of the world in the brain. We aimed to understand how the macaque brain stores such general world knowledge, focusing on object color knowledge. Three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were conducted in macaque monkeys: viewing chromatic and achromatic gratings, viewing grayscale images of their familiar fruits and vegetables (e.g., grayscale strawberry), and viewing true- and false-colored objects (e.g., red strawberry and green strawberry). We observed robust object knowledge representations in the color patches, especially the one located around TEO: the activity patterns could classify grayscale pictures of objects based on their memory color and response patterns in these regions could translate between chromatic grating viewing and grayscale object viewing (e.g., red grating—grayscale images of strawberry), such that classifiers trained by viewing chromatic gratings could successfully classify grayscale object images according to their memory colors. Our results showed direct positive evidence of object color memory in macaque monkeys. These results indicate the perceptually grounded knowledge representation as a conservative memory mechanism and open a new avenue to study this particular (semantic) memory representation with macaque models.

                <p>by Carlos Pascual-Caro, Jaime de Juan-Sanz</p>

To enable transmission of information in the brain, synaptic vesicles fuse to presynaptic membranes, liberating their content and exposing transiently a myriad of vesicular transmembrane proteins. However, versatile methods for quantifying the synaptic translocation of endogenous proteins during neuronal activity remain unavailable, as the fast dynamics of synaptic vesicle cycling difficult specific isolation trafficking proteins during such a transient surface exposure. Here, we developed a novel approach using synaptic cleft proximity labeling to capture and quantify activity-driven trafficking of endogenous synaptic proteins at the synapse. We show that accelerating cleft biotinylation times to match the fast dynamics of vesicle exocytosis allows capturing endogenous proteins transiently exposed at the synaptic surface during neural activity, enabling for the first time the study of the translocation of nearly every endogenous synaptic protein. As proof-of-concept, we further applied this technology to obtain direct evidence of the surface translocation of noncanonical trafficking proteins, such as ATG9A and NPTX1, which had been proposed to traffic during activity but for which direct proof had not yet been shown. The technological advancement presented here will facilitate future studies dissecting the molecular identity of proteins exocytosed at the synapse during activity, helping to define the molecular machinery that sustains neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.

The mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) plays crucial role in intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of oxidative metabolism. In recent decades, the role of MCU pore-forming proteins has been highlighted in cancer. However, the contribution of MCU-associated regulatory proteins mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 and 2 (MICU1 and MICU2) to pathophysiological conditions has been poorly investigated. Here, we describe the role of MICU2 in cell proliferation and invasion using in vitro and in vivo models of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated an increase in MICU2 expression and the MICU2/MICU1 ratio in advanced CRC and CRC-derived metastases. We report that expression of MICU2 is necessary for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and quality of the mitochondrial network. Our data reveal the interplay between MICU2 and MICU1 in the metabolic flexibility between anaerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS. Overall, our study sheds light on the potential role of the MICUs in diseases associated with metabolic reprogramming.

                <p>by Aijun Liu, Yezhou Liu, Geng Chen, Wenping Lyu, Fang Ye, Junlin Wang, Qiwen Liao, Lizhe Zhu, Yang Du, Richard D. Ye</p>

Chemerin is an adipokine with chemotactic activity to a subset of leukocytes. Chemerin binds to 3 G protein-coupled receptors, including chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1), and C-C chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2). Here, we report that GPR1 is capable of Gi signaling when stimulated with full-length chemerin or its C-terminal nonapeptide (C9, YFPGQFAFS). We present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Gi-coupled GPR1 bound to full-length chemerin and to the C9 peptide, respectively. C9 insertion into the transmembrane (TM) binding pocket is both necessary and sufficient for GPR1 signaling, whereas the full-length chemerin uses its bulky N-terminal core for interaction with a β-strand located at the N-terminus of GPR1. This interaction involves multiple β-strands of full-length chemerin, forming a β-sheet that serves as a “lid” for the TM binding pocket and is energetically expensive to remove as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations with free energy landscape analysis. Combining results from functional assays, our structural model explains why C9 is an activating peptide at GPR1 and how the full-length chemerin uses a “two-site” model for enhanced interaction with GPR1.

                Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a widely distributed bacterium that is Gram-positive and serves as the primary cause of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) episodes. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a sequela resulting from repeated ARF attacks which are also caused by repeated GAS infections. ARF/RHD morbidity and mortality rates are incredibly high in low- and middle-income countries. This is closely related to poor levels of sanitation which causes the enhanced incidence of GAS infections. Management of carditis in RHD cases is quite challenging, particularly in developing countries, considering that medical treatment is only palliative, while definitive treatment often requires more invasive procedures with high costs. Preventive action through vaccination against GAS infection is one of the most effective steps as a solution in reducing RHD morbidity and mortality due to curative treatments are expensive. Various developments of M-protein-based GAS vaccines have been carried out over the last few decades and have recently begun to enter the clinical stage. Nevertheless, this vaccination generates cross-reactive antibodies that might trigger ARF assaults as a result of the resemblance between the M-protein structure and proteins found in many human tissues. Consequently, the development of a vaccine utilizing L-Rhamnose derived from the poly-rhamnose backbone of Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) commenced. The L-Rhamnose-based vaccine was chosen due to the absence of the Rhamnose biosynthesis pathway in mammalian cells including humans thus this molecule is not found in any body tissue. Recent pre-clinical studies reveal that L-Rhamnose-based vaccines provide a protective effect by increasing IgG antibody titers without causing cross-reactive antibodies in test animal tissue. These findings demonstrate that the L-Rhamnose-based vaccine possesses strong immunogenicity, which effectively protects against GAS infection while maintaining a significantly higher degree of safety.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

Haemorrhages and vasculature disfunctions are a clinical feature not only of viral haemorrhagic fevers, but also in scurvy, diabetes and thrombotic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Interestingly, the expression of glucose and ascorbate transporter Glut-1 on the erythrocyte membrane is associated with the inability to synthesize ascorbate and is restricted to that very species that are susceptible to filoviruses (primates, humans and fruit bats). Glut-1 may play a pivotal role in haemorrhagic fever pathogenesis. TIM-1 and TAM receptors have been recognized to enhance entry of Ebola, Lassa and Dengue viruses and viral interferences with TIM-1 could disturb its function, disturbing the expression of Glut-1. In those species not able to synthesize ascorbate and expressing Glut-1 on erythrocytes virus could interact with Glut-1 or other functionally related protein, and the influx of glucose into the cells would be severely impaired. As a consequence, transient hyperglycemia and a marked oxidative stress coupled with the high levels of glucose in plasma would be established, and then promote the activation of NF–κB transcription, exacerbating a pro-inflammatory response mediated by cytokines and chemokines: The inability to synthesize ascorbate is an Achilles Heel when trying to counteract the oxidative stress.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1286/v1?src=rss">Assessment of water quality in the piped water supply system by using Water Quality index method [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Drinking water of the right and approved quality is a basic requirement for the development of any civilization. According to SDG 6 it is crucial to provide every citizen with equitable water quality and quantity. Methods The study area is the smart city of Bhubaneswar with 67 wards and three zones: the north zone, south-west zone, and south-east zone with around 12.4 lakh population. To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there is a deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system is still existing due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health Engineering department.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1285/v1?src=rss">Adenomyoepithelioma of the breast: Clinical, radiological, and histopathological insights with case reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Adenomyoepithelioma is a rare benign tumor classified among myoepithelial and epithelial-myoepithelial tumors. While it can occur in various locations, its presence in the mammary gland is extremely uncommon. The diagnosis relies heavily on histological and immunohistochemical characteristics, as radiological findings are often non-specific. Case Presentations Case 1: A 46-year-old woman presented with an ulcerated inflammatory mass in the left breast, evolving for one year. Clinical examination revealed multiple masses and ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Initial biopsies suggested intraductal papilloma, but subsequent analysis confirmed adenomyoepithelioma after a macro biopsy. A mastectomy was performed, revealing a solid-cystic lesion with clear surgical margins, and the patient had a favorable postoperative course. Case 2: A 38-year-old woman presented with an irregular mass at the junction of the upper quadrants of her right breast. Imaging revealed complex solid masses, leading to a diagnosis of adenomyoepithelioma with malignant transformation. A modified radical mastectomy was performed, followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy. The patient tolerated the treatment well and exhibited good clinical progress. Conclusion Adenomyoepithelioma, though rare, can manifest with diverse clinical and imaging features, sometimes mimicking more common breast lesions. Accurate diagnosis often requires comprehensive histological examination. These cases underscore the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and tailored surgical management to optimize patient outcomes.

                The ability to learn from experience that certain cues and situations are associated with threats or safety is crucial for survival and adaptive behavior. Understanding the neural substrates of threat and safety learning has high clinical significance because deficits in these forms of learning characterize anxiety disorders. Traditionally, dopamine neurons were thought to uniformly support reward learning by signaling reward prediction errors. However, the dopamine system is functionally more diverse than was initially appreciated and is also critical for processing threat and safety. In this review, I highlight recent studies demonstrating that dopamine neurons generate prediction errors for threat and safety, and describe how dopamine projections to the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and striatum regulate associative threat and safety learning.

                Ion channels are biological transistors that control ionic flux across cell membranes to regulate electrical transmission and signal transduction. They are found in all biological membranes and their conductive state kinetics are frequently disrupted in human diseases. Organelle ion channels are among the most resistant to functional and pharmacological interrogation. Traditional channel protein reconstitution methods rely upon exogenous expression and/or purification from endogenous cellular sources which are frequently contaminated by resident ionophores. Here, we describe a fully synthetic method to assay functional properties of polycystin channels that natively traffic to primary cilia and endoplasmic reticulum organelles. Using this method, we characterize their oligomeric assembly, membrane integration, orientation, and conductance while comparing these results to their endogenous channel properties. Outcomes define a novel synthetic approach that can be applied broadly to investigate channels resistant to biophysical analysis and pharmacological characterization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91994">Large-scale analysis of the integration of enhancer-enhancer signals by promoters</a></h4>

              
                Genes are often regulated by multiple enhancers. It is poorly understood how the individual enhancer activities are combined to control promoter activity. Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse embryonic stem cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals in a non-linear manner that depends on promoter strength. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94658">The T cell receptor β chain repertoire of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes improves neoantigen prediction and prioritization</a></h4>

              
                In the realm of cancer immunotherapy, the meticulous selection of neoantigens plays a fundamental role in enhancing personalized treatments. Traditionally, this selection process has heavily relied on predicting the binding of peptides to human leukocyte antigens (pHLA). Nevertheless, this approach often overlooks the dynamic interaction between tumor cells and the immune system. In response to this limitation, we have developed an innovative prediction algorithm rooted in machine learning, integrating T cell receptor β chain (TCRβ) profiling data from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients for a more precise neoantigen prioritization. TCRβ sequencing was conducted to profile the TCR repertoire of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 28 CRC patients. The data unveiled both intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity in the TCRβ repertoires of CRC patients, likely resulting from the stochastic utilization of V and J segments in response to neoantigens. Our novel combined model integrates pHLA binding information with pHLA-TCR binding to prioritize neoantigens, resulting in heightened specificity and sensitivity compared to models using individual features alone. The efficacy of our proposed model was corroborated through ELISpot assays on long peptides, performed on four CRC patients. These assays demonstrated that neoantigen candidates prioritized by our combined model outperformed predictions made by the established tool NetMHCpan. This comprehensive assessment underscores the significance of integrating pHLA binding with pHLA-TCR binding analysis for more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96576">Regional response to light illuminance across the human hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Light exerts multiple non-image-forming biological effects on physiology including the stimulation of alertness and cognition. However, the subcortical circuitry underlying the stimulating impact of light is not established in humans. We used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the impact of variations in light illuminance on the regional activity of the hypothalamus while healthy young adults (N=26; 16 women; 24.3±2.9 y) were completing two auditory cognitive tasks. We find that, during both the executive and emotional tasks, higher illuminance triggered an activity increase over the posterior part of the hypothalamus, which includes part of the tuberomamillary nucleus and the posterior part of the lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, increasing illuminance evoked a decrease in activity over the anterior and ventral parts of the hypothalamus, encompassing notably the suprachiasmatic nucleus and another part of the tuberomammillary nucleus. Critically, the performance of the executive task was improved under higher illuminance and was negatively correlated with the activity of the posterior hypothalamus area. These findings reveal the distinct local dynamics of different hypothalamus regions that underlie the impact of light on cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97088">Development of a Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling to study cooperative behaviors</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans, has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MarmoAAP), a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities. Furthermore, MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/78738">Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 controls regulatory T cell subset differentiation and effector function</a></h4>

              
                FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are key for immune homeostasis. Here, we reveal that nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) controls naïve and effector Treg cell states. Upon NCOR1 deletion in T cells, effector Treg cell frequencies were elevated in mice and in in vitro-generated human Treg cells. NCOR1-deficient Treg cells failed to protect mice from severe weight loss and intestinal inflammation associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis, indicating impaired suppressive function. NCOR1 controls the transcriptional integrity of Treg cells, since effector gene signatures were already upregulated in naïve NCOR1-deficient Treg cells while effector NCOR1-deficient Treg cells failed to repress genes associated with naïve Treg cells. Moreover, genes related to cholesterol homeostasis including targets of liver X receptor (LXR) were dysregulated in NCOR1-deficient Treg cells. However, genetic ablation of LXRβ in T cells did not revert the effects of NCOR1 deficiency, indicating that NCOR1 controls naïve and effector Treg cell subset composition independent from its ability to repress LXRβ-induced gene expression. Thus, our study reveals that NCOR1 maintains naïve and effector Treg cell states via regulating their transcriptional integrity. We also reveal a critical role for this epigenetic regulator in supporting the suppressive functions of Treg cells in vivo.

	<p>Background. Language development in toddlers can be influenced by social interactions in environments and proximal contexts with mothers and fathers. We present the literature on mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; education level and socioeconomic status on the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s language development; further evidence is needed in the Italian-speaking context. Aims. The study aims to confirm the role of mother and father education level on toddlers&amp;amp;rsquo; language skills assessed with direct and indirect measures. Methods and Procedures. Participants were 51 Italian-speaking children aged 33 to 41 months. Children were tested with a lexical test (PinG test) for comprehension and production of nouns and predicates and a morpho-syntactic test for grammar comprehension (PCGO). Parents of the children completed a demographic form and the Italian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates CDI long version. Two series of one-way ANCOVAs were performed to study the role of mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education on separate measures of their child&amp;amp;rsquo;s language. Outcomes and Results. Findings suggest that in most families, mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education is higher than fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education. There was no significant difference between children of parents with low&amp;amp;ndash;middle level of education and children of parents with high level of education for the grammar comprehension tasks (PCGO) and indirect measure of vocabulary production (MacArthur-Bates CDI). However, both mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; level of education appears to be significant for the direct measurement of word production. Conclusions and Implications. This study provides new evidence for the role of mothers&amp;amp;rsquo; and fathers&amp;amp;rsquo; education on the development of word production in children aged 33 to 41 months, contributing to enriching the literature on the Italian context; it lays the groundwork for future research on the social and environmental factors that can affect language development.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Opting to perform emotion regulation when facing high-arousal stimuli enhances the reduction in negative emotions. Previous research has indicated that self-choice, that is, personally choosing from multiple alternatives, can improve performance. However, it is unclear whether the emotion regulation strategy chosen among multiple alternatives in daily life enhances stress reduction compared to a forced strategy. This study aimed to reveal the effects of self-choice emotion regulation and its underlying neural basis. Methods: Participants were 40 healthy adults who met the inclusion criteria; they performed self-choice emotion regulation, forced emotion regulation, and no emotion regulation (the control condition) while their brain activity was captured using a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. First, the participants were shown a stressful scenario. Secondly, they rated the stress they experienced. Thirdly, they performed self-choice or forced emotion regulation or did nothing. Finally, participants rated their stress level again. Results: Self-choice emotion regulation reduced stress better than forced-choice emotion regulation. The stress reduction was associated with decreases in the activation of the left opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Self-choice can improve emotion regulation, and this effect is likely mediated by the neural efficiency of the left inferior frontal gyrus.</p>

	<p>Objectives&amp;amp;mdash;Our aim is to investigate the executive functions involved in idiom comprehension. The understanding of idioms has largely been explored from a developmental perspective. However, little is known about the cognitive processes involved. Recent studies highlight the contributions of working memory and inhibitory control in idiom processing. We investigated executive functions&amp;amp;rsquo; implication in idiom comprehension from a life-span perspective. Methods&amp;amp;mdash;The participants of this study were aged from 6 years to adulthood (n = 109 participants). An idiom comprehension task and executive tests were administered. Results and Conclusions&amp;amp;mdash;The results indicated that idiom comprehension improved across all the age groups tested. Moreover, the involvement of inhibition and cognitive flexibility processes was specific at different ages and particularly involved during adolescence.</p>

	<p>Background: Adult Changes in Thought (ACT), a prospective cohort study, enrolls older adult members of Kaiser Permanente Washington. We describe an ambitious project to abstract medical records facilitating epidemiological investigation. Methods: Abstracted data include medications; laboratory results; women&amp;amp;rsquo;s health; blood pressure; physical injuries; cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric and other medical conditions. Results: Of 1419 of 5763 participants with completed abstractions, 1387 (97.7%) were deceased; 602 (42.4%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias; 985 (69.4%) had a brain autopsy. Each participant had an average of 34.3 (SD = 13.4) years of data abstracted. Over 64% had pharmacy data preceding 1977; 87.5% had laboratory data preceding 1988. Stroke, anxiety, depression and confusion during hospitalization were common among participants diagnosed with dementia. Conclusions: Medical records are transformed into data for analyses with outcomes derived from other ACT data. We provide detailed, unparalleled longitudinal clinical data to support a variety of epidemiological research on clinical-pathological correlations.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Debates regarding how to represent verb phrases (VPs) consisting of the verb plus the complement and the aspectual marker -le in Mandarin Chinese remain an issue. Methods: Syntactic priming under a memory disguise paradigm was employed to investigate the issue using the SVO-ba alternation, where the SVO structure consists of a subject verb object, and the ba structure of a subject ba object verb, in five-year-olds (n = 216), an age with fully fledged grammatical knowledge but little interference from literacy. Results: The results indicate that both the complement and the marker -le should be represented in terms of phrasal rather than morphological structures. When -le is inflected to the verb alone, realization, which makes an event a fact, rather than completion, which makes an event finished, is accomplished. The event must be telicized to a state through a resultative complement to induce reliable production of the ba construction. The postverbal elements represent their own phrasal structure and challenge the verb-centered lexico-syntactic account because there are no additional representations left within a verb. Conclusions: More elicitations of the SVO than the ba invite future neurolinguistic explorations to disentangle the impacts of the frequency and thematic arrangement of agent and patient on grammatical representations cross-linguistically.</p>

	<p>Background: Managing anxiety and behavior during pediatric dental procedures is challenging. This study examines the effects of combining ibuprofen with midazolam sedation using both behavioral management and clinical hypnosis to improve patient cooperation and reduce post-treatment pain. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 311 children (mean age 74.2 months, standard deviation (SD) = 24.7) was conducted. Patients received either midazolam with ibuprofen (n = 156) or midazolam only (n = 155). Behavior was assessed using the Venham Behavior Rating Scale and anxiety with the Dental Subscale of Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fear Survey Schedule (CFSS-DS) and the Inventory of Stressful Situations (ISS) questionnaires. Statistical analyses included Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests and correlation analyses. Results: Ibuprofen did not significantly improve behavior during procedures (drinking phase 0.61, SD 1.31, p = 0.13; before treatment 0.25, SD 0.93, p = 0.53, anesthesia 1.21, SD 1.55, p = 0.29; after treatment 0.51, SD 1.22, p = 0.68), indicating that pharmacological pain management alone is insufficient to address behavioral challenges. Ibuprofen significantly reduced post-treatment pain, with 7.2% of cases reporting pain in the non-ibuprofen group compared to none in the ibuprofen group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Ibuprofen had no effect on intraoperative behavior and only a limited effect on post-procedural pain, mainly for more invasive procedures. This study highlights the integration of sedation with behavioral strategies, such as clinical hypnosis, to manage anxiety and improve patient cooperation, aiming to enhance treatment outcomes using this integrative approach to pediatric dentistry. Further research is needed to optimize these strategies and verify them in a prospective setting.</p>

                Rabani et al. show that CD84 upregulation leads to increased immune suppression in the TME of TNBC. In Bregs, CD84 controls interleukin-10 expression through the β-catenin/Tcf4 pathway. Blocking CD84 potentiates anti-tumor immunity, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Hence, the authors suggest CD84 as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Driving abilities require the synchronized activity of cerebral networks associated with sensorimotor integration, motricity, and executive functions. Drivers with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (DwP) have impaired driving ability, but little is known about the impact of &amp;amp;ldquo;wearing-off&amp;amp;rdquo; and therapies in addition to L-DOPA on driving capacities. This study aimed to (i) compare driving performance between DwP during different motor states and healthy controls and (ii) assess the impact of add-on therapies on driving abilities. Methods: DwP (n = 26) were enrolled as individuals experiencing wearing-off symptoms and treated (within 6 months before the enrollment) with add-on therapies to L-DOPA, including MAO inhibitors for DwP-A (n = 12) or opicapone for DwP-B (n = 14). Age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 12) were also enrolled. DwP received two driving assessments in a driving simulator during their &amp;amp;ldquo;best-on&amp;amp;rdquo; time and during their wearing-off time on different days. An anamnestic driving questionnaire was collected with the assistance of partners. A Virtual Driving Rating Scale (VDRS) was calculated, as well as learning curves (LCs) for driving items calculated in minutes. Results: DwP reported worse driving performance than CON at the driving questionnaire. In line with this, DwP showed worse VDRS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and LC (p = 0.021) than CON. Lower VDRS was associated with wearing-off (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but DwP-B had better driving performance while in their &amp;amp;ldquo;best-on&amp;amp;rdquo; time (p = 0.037) and more items improving with LCs (7 vs. 3) than DwP-A. Conclusions: DwP demonstrated impaired driving compared to controls. Wearing-off symptoms can also affect driving ability, but therapies (opicapone more so than MAO inhibitors) may play a role in preserving specific driving skills, possibly through maintaining learning abilities.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and emotional instability (EI) using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Additionally, it sought to identify key molecular mechanisms underlying emotional instability through a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. Methods: MR analyses utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were conducted to estimate the effects of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the BMR on PTSD, MDD, and EI. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Concurrently, a bioinformatic analysis was executed on gene expression datasets (GSE53987 and GSE21138) derived from emotionally unstable patients. This analysis encompassed the differential gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by an functional enrichment analysis to uncover key molecular pathways associated with EI. Results: The MR analysis revealed that increased physical activity may have a protective effect against PTSD, albeit with inconsistent effects on MDD and EI. Sedentary behavior and the BMR demonstrated minimal associations with PTSD, MDD, or EI. The bioinformatic analysis identified 114 DEGs associated with EI, with YWHAB, SRRM2, MST1, HDAC10, and HSPA1A highlighted as significant genes. The functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs unveiled key pathways potentially involved in the molecular pathology of emotional instability. Conclusions: Physical activity appears to protect against PTSD, whereas its effects on MDD and EI are less definitive. The bioinformatic findings offer a deeper molecular understanding of EI, pinpointing specific genes and pathways that may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Further research is warranted to elucidate these intricate interactions and the identified molecular mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Migraine is a disease that stands out for its high prevalence and socioeconomic costs. It involves the entire trigeminovascular system, the signaling substances, and their targets. However, the role of meningeal mast cells in migraine is still unclear. To better understand one of the components of neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology, we developed an in vivo rat model in which the dura mater was exposed bilaterally to investigate the influence of topiramate on capsaicin-induced mast cell degranulation and CGRP release from dura mater. Methods: On the day of the experiment, rats were anesthetized, and a craniectomy was performed on each parietal bone. Test substances were applied in situ over the dura mater using the right and left sides of the dura mater for the test and control, respectively. After exposure, the dura mater was processed for mast cell staining and counting. Using this setup, the effect of capsaicin (10&amp;amp;minus;3 M) was evaluated in rats of both sexes, and subsequently the effect of in situ (10&amp;amp;minus;3 M, 20 &amp;amp;micro;L) and (20 mg/kg/day for 10 days) topiramate treatment on mast cell degranulation and CGRP release were evaluated. Results: In both female and male rats, there was a greater amount of degranulated mast cells in the side stimulated by capsaicin compared to the control side in both females (18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3% vs. 74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3%; p = 0.016) and males (28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2% vs. 74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3%, p = 0.016). In the group treated with topiramate for 10 days prior to the experiments, capsaicin did not induce mast cell degranulation (control 20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% vs. capsaicin 22 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.375) in contrast to animals treated for 10 days with gavage control (control 25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% vs. capsaicin 76 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.016). Topiramate applied in situ concomitant with capsaicin did not protect the mast cells from degranulation in response to capsaicin (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2% vs. 44 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.016). There was a significant reduction in CGRP release from the dura mater in the group treated with topiramate for 10 days compared to the control. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a novel experimental model wherein systemic administration of topiramate is observed to modulate the impact of capsaicin on meningeal mast cell degranulation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) has the potential to draw positive consequences from trauma. Hence, there is interest in finding ways to promote PTG. Research has identified an attentional bias towards positive resilience-related words (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;persistence&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;amp;rdquo;) in university students who report high PTG after experiencing adversities. Although people can respond to these experiences by showing low PTG, this bias seems to help with their struggle by making purposeful contents more accessible. Therefore, boosting attentional bias towards positive resilience-related words could help people with low PTG. Methods: In this study, the participants were thirty-six university students who had experienced bullying before entering university. Using a Stroop emotional task, they identified the color of resilience and neutral words, either positive or negative, before and after being submitted to transcranial direct current stimulation. Stimulation was targeted at the right temporal area involved in intentionality processing. Results: In the anodal condition, the results support a stimulation effect on the resilience attentional bias that could benefit participants with low PTG. A significant moderation of approach motivation for this effect was also found. Specifically, only when participants had medium or high approach motivation did stimulation boost the attentional bias in students with low PTG. Conclusions: These results support that tDCS stimulation in this brain area is effective in enhancing resilience attentional bias in low-PTG students. However, for this effect to occur it is necessary to have approach motivation, which is motivation related to goals.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Microsurgical clipping has traditionally been considered a standard treatment for middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. Recently, a caseload reduction related to improved endovascular treatment options has occurred in cerebrovascular neurosurgery. Therefore, studies that report the clinical and radiological outcomes after clipping are highly warranted. Methods: Patients with an unruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysm, who were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery in Linz between 2002 and 2019, were included in this study. Clinical and radiological outcome parameters were evaluated for each patient. Results: Overall, 272 patients were eligible for inclusion. Complete aneurysm occlusion was demonstrated in 266 (99.3%) of the 268 (98.5%) patients who underwent postoperative digital subtraction angiography. In six (2.2%) patients, a permanent new neurological deficit (pNND) persisted after treatment. Intraoperative aneurysm rupture was a significant factor (p = 0.0049) in the logistic regression. At the last follow-up, only two patients (0.7%) had an unfavorable outcome (mRS &amp;amp;gt; 2). More recent surgeries were associated with fewer cases of pNND (p = 0.009). A transient new neurological deficit occurred in 13 patients (4.8%), with aneurysm size being a significant risk factor (p = 0.009). Surgical site infections were reported in four patients (1.5%), with patient age (p = 0.039) and time (p = 0.001) being significant factors. Two patients died (0.7%) perioperatively and two patients (0.7%) needed a retreatment in the long-term follow-up. Conclusions: The findings indicate that microsurgical clipping is a safe procedure with minimal need for retreatment. It achieves a high occlusion rate while maintaining a very low rate of adverse outcomes. Continuous intraoperative enhancements over time have contributed to a progressive improvement in clinical outcomes in recent years. This trend is exemplified by the absence of detectable pNND in the era of ICG angiography. Consequently, these data support the conclusion that microsurgical clipping should still be considered an appropriate treatment option for unruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysms.</p>

	<p>In schizophrenia, it was suggested that an integrated and multimodal approach, combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, could improve functional outcomes and clinical features in patients living with schizophrenia (PLWS). Among these alternatives, evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) represent feasible treatment options targeting the clinical features that are unmet needs of PLWS (especially negative and cognitive symptoms). As no clear evidence is available on the combination of these non-pharmacological approaches, this review aimed to collect the available literature on the combination of EBPIs and NIBS in the treatment of PLWS. We demonstrated that the field of combining EBPIs and NIBS in schizophrenia is in its infancy, as only 11 studies were reviewed. In fact, only a few trials, with divergent results, combined these non-pharmacological modalities; while emerging evidence is available on the combination of cognitive remediation and rTMS/iTBS, inconclusive results were obtained. Conversely, albeit preliminary, more solid findings are available on the combination of HF-rTMS and family intervention. Moreover, despite the fact that cognitive activation could not be considered an EBPI, promising results are available in combination with tDCS to improve the working memory domain. To overcome these limitations, we considered several methodological issues to promote research in this field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face challenges in social communication due to difficulties in considering context, processing information, and interpreting social cues. This study aims to explore the neural processes related to pragmatic language communication in children with ASD and address the research question of how functional brain connectivity operates during complex pragmatic language tasks. Methods: We examined differences in brain functional connectivity between children with ASD and typically developing peers while they engaged in video recordings of spoken language tasks. We focused on two types of speech acts: semantic and pragmatic. Results: Our results showed differences between groups during the pragmatic and semantic language processing, indicating more idiosyncratic connectivity in children with ASD in the Left Somatomotor and Left Limbic networks, suggesting that these networks play a role in task-dependent functional connectivity. Additionally, these functional differences were mainly localized to the left hemisphere.</p>

	<p>Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently a promising technique for psychiatric patients with severe and treatment-resistant symptoms. However, the results to date have been quite heterogeneous, and the indications for psychosurgery with DBS remain in an experimental phase. One of the major challenges limiting the advancement of DBS in psychiatric disorders is the lack of objective criteria for diagnosing certain conditions, which are often based more on clinical scales rather than measurable biological markers. Additionally, there is a limited capacity to objectively assess treatment outcomes. Methods: This overview examines the literature on the available biomarkers in psychosurgery in relation to DBS, as well as other relevant biomarkers in psychiatry with potential applicability for this treatment modality. Results: There are five types of biomarkers: clinical/behavioral, omic, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neurobiochemical. The information provided by each biomarker within these categories is highly variable and may be relevant for diagnosis, response prediction, target selection, program adjustment, etc. Conclusions: A better understanding of biomarkers and their applications would allow DBS in psychosurgery to advance on a more objective basis, guided by the information provided by them and within the context of precision psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a leading neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting approximately 55 million individuals globally, a number projected to escalate to 139 million by 2050. Despite extensive research spanning several decades, the cure for AD remains at a developing stage. The only existing therapeutic options are limited to symptom management, and are often accompanied by adverse side effects. The pathological features of AD, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, result in progressive neuronal death, synaptic loss, and brain atrophy, leading to significant cognitive decline and a marked reduction in quality of life. Objective: In light of the shortcomings of existing pharmacological interventions, this review explores the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) as a non-invasive therapeutic option for AD. PBM employs infrared light to facilitate cellular repair and regeneration, focusing on addressing the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s underlying biomechanical mechanisms. Method: This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the mechanisms of PBM and an analysis of preclinical studies evaluating its impact on cellular health, cognitive function, and disease progression in AD.The review provides a comprehensive overview of the various wavelengths and application methods, evaluating their efficacy in mitigating AD-related symptoms. Conclusions: The findings underscore the significant potential of PBM as a safe and effective alternative treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, emphasizing the necessity for further research and clinical trials to establish its therapeutic efficacy conclusively.</p>

                <p>Pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, has recently been found to play an important role in spinal cord injury (SCI). C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), and NLR-family CARD-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) have been reported to be associated with neuronal pyroptosis, but few studies have clarified their functions and regulatory mechanisms in SCI. In this study, CLEC5A, TREM1, and NLRC4 were highly expressed in lidocaine-induced SCI rat models, and their knockdown alleviated lidocaine-induced SCI. The elevation of pyroptosis-related indicators LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; levels in SCI rats was attenuated after silencing of CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. Lidocaine-induced decrease in cell viability and the elevation in cell death were partly reversed after CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4 silencing. Lidocaine-mediated effects on the levels of LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; in lidocaine-induced PC12 cells were weakened by downregulating CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. CLEC5A could interact with TREM1 to mediate NLRC4 expression, thus accelerating neuronal pyroptosis, ultimately leading to SCI exacerbation. In conclusions, CLEC5A interacted with TREM1 to increase NLRC4 expression, thus promoting neuronal pyroptosis in rat SCI models, providing new insights into the role of neuronal pyroptosis in SCI.</p>

                <p>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) from <I>Polygonum multiflorum</I> exerts neuroprotective effects after ischemic stroke. We explored whether TSG improved ischemic stroke injury via PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro model and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model were established. Cerebral injury was assessed by neurological score, hematoxylin and eosin staining, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and brain water content. Apoptosis, cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8, and JC-1 staining, respectively. Colocalization of LC3-labeled autophagosomes with lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2-labeled lysosomes or translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20-labeled mitochondria was observed with fluorescence microscopy. The ubiquitination level was determined using ubiquitination assay. The interaction between molecules was validated by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione <I>S</I>-transferase pull-down. We found that TSG promoted mitophagy and improved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion damage in MCAO rats. In OGD/R-subjected neurons, TSG promoted mitophagy, repressed neuronal apoptosis, upregulated Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1), and activated PINK1/Parkin signaling. TSG upregulated ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) to elevate YBX1 protein. Furthermore, USP10 inhibited ubiquitination-dependent YBX1 degradation. <I>USP10</I> overexpression activated PINK1/Parkin signaling and promoted mitophagy, which were reversed by <I>YBX1</I> knockdown. Moreover, TSG upregulated USP10 to promote mitophagy and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, TSG facilitated PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy by upregulating USP10/YBX1 axis to ameliorate ischemic stroke.</p>

                <p>It remains unknown whether the Chinese tree shrew, regarded as the closest sister of primate, has evolved a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) comparable with primates that is characterized by a fourth layer (L4) enriched with granular cells and reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Here, we reported that following AAV-hSyn-EGFP expression in the MD neurons, the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography revealed their projection trajectories and targeted brain areas, such as the hippocampus, the corpus striatum, and the dlPFC. Cre-dependent transsynaptic viral tracing identified the MD projection terminals that targeted the L4 of the dlPFC, in which the presence of granular cells was confirmed via cytoarchitectural studies by using the Nissl, Golgi, and vGlut2 stainings. Additionally, the L5/6 of the dlPFC projected back to the MD. These results suggest that the tree shrew has evolved a primate-like dlPFC which can serve as an alternative for studying cognition-related functions of the dlPFC.</p>

Data in behavioral research is often quantified with event-logging software, generating large data sets containing detailed information about subjects, recipients, and the duration of behaviors. Exploring and analyzing such large data sets can be challenging without tools to visualize behavioral interactions between individuals or transitions between behavioral states, yet software that can adequately visualize complex behavioral data sets is rare. TIBA (The Interactive Behavior Analyzer) is a web application for behavioral data visualization, which provides a series of interactive visualizations, including the temporal occurrences of behavioral events, the number and direction of interactions between individuals, the behavioral transitions and their respective transitional frequencies, as well as the visual and algorithmic comparison of the latter across data sets. It can therefore be applied to visualize behavior across individuals, species, or contexts. Several filtering options (selection of behaviors and individuals) together with options to set node and edge properties (in the network drawings) allow for interactive customization of the output drawings, which can also be downloaded afterwards. TIBA accepts data outputs from popular logging software and is implemented in Python and JavaScript, with all current browsers supported. The web application and usage instructions are available at tiba.inf.uni-konstanz.de. The source code is publicly available on GitHub: github.com/LSI-UniKonstanz/tiba.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002894">Why does invasive brain stimulation sometimes improve memory and sometimes impair it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Uma R. Mohan, Joshua Jacobs</p>

Invasive brain stimulation is used to treat individuals with episodic memory loss; however, studies to date report both enhancement and impairment of memory. This Essay discusses the sources of this variability, and suggests a path towards developing customized stimulation protocols for more consistent memory enhancement.
Author summary: Episodic memory is a critical aspect of everyday life that allows us to recall events, make decisions, and navigate our environments. It is estimated that 1 in 25 Americans suffer from episodic memory loss from Alzheimer ‘s disease, dementia, or following a traumatic brain injury. Clinicians and researchers have recently tried to help supplement or repair memory in individuals with episodic memory disorders using electrical brain stimulation. However, although there is evidence of invasive brain stimulation improving memory, studies also show that it can have variable effects, and sometimes cause memory impairment. In this Essay, we investigate these differences and try to explain this variability. We propose that key aspects of the memory network are heterogeneous across individuals, requiring customized stimulation protocols to create successful brain stimulation systems for memory enhancement. We provide a plan for applying brain stimulation while overcoming this variability by using closed-loop stimulation protocols that are customized according to a person’s own anatomical structure, functional connectivity, and memory-related electrophysiological patterns.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-616/v2?src=rss">Current real world health data of telemedicine for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Hille et al. wish to strengthen connections between human research and animal models of brain plasticity. They propose to make greater use of macroscopic imaging methods in animals, intensify cross-species research, and develop models linking microscopic events to macroscopically accessible phenomena.

                Liu et al. show that C. elegans specifically recognizes divergent oomycete pathogens through paired transmembrane C-type lectin receptors. These act mainly in AWA neurons and the intestine to induce in the epidermis a protective immune response characterized by the induction of chitinase-like (chil) genes.

                Lloyd et al. generated a comprehensive microglia proteome database, identifying over 11,000 proteins. Fundamental differences between ex vivo and in vitro microglia associated with protein synthesis, metabolism, and inflammatory marker expression are highlighted, and dynamic reprogramming of microglia proteomes is shown to be induced by changes in environment.
