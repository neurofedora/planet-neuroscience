Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Manuel   Valero, Liset Menendez   de la Prida<br /> Understanding how the brain represents events is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="159" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Yutaka   Yoshida, Tadashi   Isa<br /> An ability to control dexterous hand movements is considered to parallel the evolutionary development of the corticospinal tract and the appearance of direct connections between corticospinal neurons and motoneurons (the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway), which developed uniquely in higher primates. However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Robert R   Rozeske, Cyril   Herry<br /> The behavioral repertoire of an organism can be highly diverse, spanning from social to defensive. How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Tara E   Tracy, Li   Gan<br /> The accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is associated with neuronal deterioration and cognitive impairments in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Henrik   Boije, Klas   Kullander<br /> The spinal circuitry governing the undulatory movements of swimming vertebrates consist of excitatory and commissural inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons. This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Adil G   Khan, Sonja B   Hofer<br /> Vision is an active process. What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Emilia   Favuzzi, Beatriz   Rico<br /> The complexity and precision of cortical circuitries is achieved during development due to the exquisite diversity of synapse types that is generated in a highly regulated manner. Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Clinton   Cave, Shanthini   Sockanathan<br /> The embryonic generation of motor neurons is a complex process involving progenitor patterning, fate specification, differentiation, and maturation. Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Kanika   Bansal, Johan   Nakuci, Sarah Feldt   Muldoon<br /> Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics have begun to take a data-driven approach by incorporating structural and/or functional information derived from subject data. Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="93" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Rebecca A   Piskorowski, Vivien   Chevaleyre<br /> The hippocampus is a central region in the coding of spatial, temporal and episodic memory. Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. <br /><br />

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Craig   Blackstone<br /> Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurologic disorders characterized by prominent lower-extremity spasticity, resulting from a length-dependent axonopathy of corticospinal upper motor neurons. They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): David   Robbe<br /> A long-standing hypothesis postulates that the striatum is essential for the concurrent selection of adaptive actions and repression of inappropriate alternatives. Here, classical and recent anatomical and physiological studies are reviewed to show that, in mammals, the striatum can detect discrete task-relevant sensory stimuli and continuously track somatosensory information associated with the generation of simple movements and more complex actions. Rather than contributing to the immediate selection of actions, the striatum may monitor the sensorimotor state of animals by integrating somatosensory information and motor-related signals on a moment-by-moment basis. Such function could be critical for the progressive acquisition or updating of adaptive actions and the emergence of an embodied sense of time. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Phillip   Bokiniec, Niccolò   Zampieri, Gary R   Lewin, James FA   Poulet<br /> Thermal information about skin surface temperature is a key sense for the perception of object identity and valence. The identification of ion channels involved in the transduction of thermal changes has provided a genetic access point to the thermal system. However, from sensory specific ‘labeled-lines’ to multimodal interactive pathways, the functional organization and identity of the neural circuits mediating innocuous thermal perception have been debated for over 100 years. Here we highlight points in the system that require further attention and review recent advances using in vivo electrophysiology, cellular resolution calcium imaging, optogenetics and thermal perceptual tasks in behaving mice that have begun to uncover the anatomical principles and neural processing mechanisms underlying innocuous thermal perception. <br /><br />

<p>The assumption that action and perception can be investigated independently
is entrenched in theories, models and experimental approaches across the brain
and mind sciences. In cognitive science, this has been a central point of
contention between computationalist and 4Es (enactive, embodied, extended and
embedded) theories of cognition, with the former embracing the "classical
sandwich", modular, architecture of the mind and the latter actively denying
this separation can be made. In this work we suggest that the modular
independence of action and perception strongly resonates with the separation
principle of control theory and furthermore that this principle provides formal
criteria within which to evaluate the implications of the modularity of action
and perception. We will also see that real-time feedback with the environment,
often considered necessary for the definition of 4Es ideas, is not however a
sufficient condition to avoid the "classical sandwich". Finally, we argue that
an emerging framework in the cognitive and brain sciences, active inference,
extends ideas derived from control theory to the study of biological systems
while disposing of the separation principle, describing non-modular models of
behaviour strongly aligned with 4Es theories of cognition.

<p>by Benjamin Werner, Andrea Sottoriva</p>

The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain. We found highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation in all adult tissues (mean strand segregation probability: 0.98, standard error bounds (0.97,0.99)). In contrast, non-random strand segregation efficiency is reduced to 0.87 (0.78,0.88) in neural tissue during early development, suggesting stem cell pool expansions due to symmetric self-renewal. Healthy somatic mutation rates differed across tissue types, ranging from 3.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>/bp/division in small intestine to 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>/bp/division in skin.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JlwnjY5R61I" width="1" />

<p>by Ya-Zhou Shi, Lei Jin, Chen-Jie Feng, Ya-Lan Tan, Zhi-Jie Tan</p>

RNA pseudoknots are a kind of minimal RNA tertiary structural motifs, and their three-dimensional (3D) structures and stability play essential roles in a variety of biological functions. Therefore, to predict 3D structures and stability of RNA pseudoknots is essential for understanding their functions. In the work, we employed our previously developed coarse-grained model with implicit salt to make extensive predictions and comprehensive analyses on the 3D structures and stability for RNA pseudoknots in monovalent/divalent ion solutions. The comparisons with available experimental data show that our model can successfully predict the 3D structures of RNA pseudoknots from their sequences, and can also make reliable predictions for the stability of RNA pseudoknots with different lengths and sequences over a wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations. Furthermore, we made comprehensive analyses on the unfolding pathway for various RNA pseudoknots in ion solutions. Our analyses for extensive pseudokonts and the wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations verify that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots is mainly dependent on the relative stability of unfolded intermediate states, and show that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots can be significantly modulated by their sequences and solution ion conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VbDC_Iw4jyk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5cQl5NSCSNQ/article">Temporal precision of regulated gene expression</a></h4>

<p>by Shivam Gupta, Julien Varennes, Hendrik C. Korswagen, Andrew Mugler</p>

Important cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and development often rely on precise timing. Yet, the molecular machinery that regulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with noisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a diminishing repressor. We find that either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated strategy. The optimal regulation corresponds to a nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time, arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the timing noise of the regulator and that of the target molecule itself, and is robust to additional effects such as bursts and cell division. Our results are in quantitative agreement with the nonlinear increase and low noise of <i>mig-1</i> gene expression in migrating neuroblast cells during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5cQl5NSCSNQ" width="1" />

The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a complex, multifactorial disorder that develops slowly over time presenting itself with large differences among MetS patients. We applied a systems biology approach to describe and predict the onset and progressive development of MetS, in a study that combined <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i> models. A new data-driven, physiological model (MINGLeD: Model INtegrating Glucose and Lipid Dynamics) was developed, describing glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Since classic kinetic models cannot describe slowly progressing disorders, a simulation method (ADAPT) was used to describe longitudinal dynamics and to predict metabolic concentrations and fluxes. This approach yielded a novel model that can describe long-term MetS development and progression. This model was integrated with longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> data that was obtained from male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for three months and that developed MetS as reflected by classical symptoms including obesity and glucose intolerance. Two distinct subgroups were identified: those who developed dyslipidemia, and those who did not. The combination of MINGLeD with ADAPT could correctly predict both phenotypes, without making any prior assumptions about changes in kinetic rates or metabolic regulation. Modeling and flux trajectory analysis revealed that differences in liver fluxes and dietary cholesterol absorption could explain this occurrence of the two different phenotypes. In individual mice with dyslipidemia dietary cholesterol absorption and hepatic turnover of metabolites, including lipid fluxes, were higher compared to those without dyslipidemia. Predicted differences were also observed in gene expression data, and consistent with the emergence of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, two well-known MetS co-morbidities. Whereas MINGLeD specifically models the metabolic derangements underlying MetS, the simulation method ADAPT is generic and can be applied to other diseases where dynamic modeling and longitudinal data are available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIj7qbH_8I8" width="1" />

<p>Probabilistic atlases provide essential spatial contextual information for
image interpretation, Bayesian modeling, and algorithmic processing. Such
atlases are typically constructed by grouping subjects with similar demographic
information. Importantly, use of the same scanner minimizes inter-group
variability. However, generalizability and spatial specificity of such
approaches is more limited than one might like. Inspired by Commowick
"Frankenstein's creature paradigm" which builds a personal specific anatomical
atlas, we propose a data-driven framework to build a personal specific
probabilistic atlas under the large-scale data scheme. The data-driven
framework clusters regions with similar features using a point distribution
model to learn different anatomical phenotypes. Regional structural atlases and
corresponding regional probabilistic atlases are used as indices and targets in
the dictionary. By indexing the dictionary, the whole brain probabilistic
atlases adapt to each new subject quickly and can be used as spatial priors for
visualization and processing. The novelties of this approach are (1) it
provides a new perspective of generating personal specific whole brain
probabilistic atlases (132 regions) under data-driven scheme across sites. (2)
The framework employs the large amount of heterogeneous data (2349 images). (3)
The proposed framework achieves low computational cost since only one affine
registration and Pearson correlation operation are required for a new subject.
Our method matches individual regions better with higher Dice similarity value
when testing the probabilistic atlases. Importantly, the advantage the
large-scale scheme is demonstrated by the better performance of using
large-scale training data (1888 images) than smaller training set (720 images).

<p>Color induction is the influence of the surrounding color (inducer) on the
perceived color of a central region. There are two different types of color
induction: color contrast (the color of the central region shifts away from
that of the inducer) and color assimilation (the color shifts towards the color
of the inducer). Several studies on these effects used uniform and striped
surrounds, reporting color contrast and color assimilation, respectively. Other
authors (Kaneko and Murakami, J Vision, 2012) studied color induction using
flashed uniform surrounds, reporting that the contrast was higher for shorter
flash duration. Extending their work, we present new psychophysical results
using both flashed and static (i.e., non-flashed) equiluminant stimuli for both
striped and uniform surround. Similarly to them, for uniform surround stimuli
we observed color contrast, but we did not obtain the maximum contrast for the
shortest (10 ms) flashed stimuli, but for 40 ms. We only observed this maximum
contrast for red, green and lime inducers, while for a purple inducer we
obtained an asymptotic profile along flash duration. For striped stimuli, we
observed color assimilation only for the static (infinite flash duration)
red-green surround inducers (red 1st inducer, green 2nd inducer). For the other
inducers' configurations, we observed color contrast or no induction. Since
other works showed that non-equiluminant striped static stimuli induce color
assimilation, our results also suggest that luminance differences could be a
key factor to induce it.

<p>Spike sorting refers to the problem of assigning action potentials observed
in extra-cellular recordings of neural activity to the neuron(s) from which
they originate. We cast this problem as one of learning a convolutional
dictionary from raw multi-electrode waveform data, subject to sparsity
constraints. In this context, sparsity refers to the number of neurons that are
allowed to spike simultaneously. The convolutional dictionary setting, along
with its assumptions (e.g. refractoriness) that are motivated by the
spike-sorting problem, let us give theoretical bounds on the sample complexity
of spike sorting as a function of the number of underlying neurons, the rate of
occurrence of simultaneous spiking, and the firing rate of the neurons. We
derive memory/computation-efficient convolutional versions of OMP (cOMP) and
KSVD (cKSVD), popular algorithms for sparse coding and dictionary learning
respectively. We demonstrate via simulations that an algorithm that alternates
between cOMP and cKSVD can recover the underlying spike waveforms successfully,
assuming few neurons spike simultaneously, and is stable in the presence of
noise. We also apply the algorithm to extra-cellular recordings from a tetrode
in the rat Hippocampus.

<p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are recently highly successful in
generative applications involving images and start being applied to time series
data. Here we describe EEG-GAN as a framework to generate
electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals. We introduce a modification to the
improved training of Wasserstein GANs to stabilize training and investigate a
range of architectural choices critical for time series generation (most
notably up- and down-sampling). For evaluation we consider and compare
different metrics such as Inception score, Frechet inception distance and
sliced Wasserstein distance, together showing that our EEG-GAN framework
generated naturalistic EEG examples. It thus opens up a range of new generative
application scenarios in the neuroscientific and neurological context, such as
data augmentation in brain-computer interfacing tasks, EEG super-sampling, or
restoration of corrupted data segments. The possibility to generate signals of
a certain class and/or with specific properties may also open a new avenue for
research into the underlying structure of brain signals.

Valadas et al. show that ER lipid imbalance causes sleep pattern defects in Parkinson’s disease by preventing the formation of secretory vesicles required for the release of the neuropeptides. Restoring the ER lipid balance by supplementation with phosphatidylserine rescues the cellular and behavioral defects.

In rodents, the extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) have been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Yet, functional evidence supporting this attribution is sparse. Here, we probed the specialization for ventral processing of rat laterolateral area (LL), located at the apex of the putative ventral-like hierarchy. To this aim, we recorded neuronal responses in both V1 and LL during presentation of drifting, oriented gratings and noise movies. We found that the degree of non-linearity of the stimulus-response relationship increased from V1 to LL, along with the tendency of neurons to respond to multiple orientations, while the sharpness of orientation tuning decreased. Critically, all these trends matched the predictions derived from a well-established model of ventral computations and from a meta-analysis of the monkey literature, thus reaffirming the specialization of LL for higher-order processing of shape information.

In patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), few therapies are available to improve neurological function. Neuromodulation of the spinal cord with epidural stimulation (EDS) has shown promise enabling the voluntary activation of motor pools caudal to the level of the injury. EDS is performed with multiple electrode arrays in which several stimulation variables such as the frequency, amplitude, and location of the stimulation significantly affect the type and amplitude of motor responses. This paper presents a novel technique to predict the final functionality of a patient with SCI after cervical EDS within a deep learning framework. Additionally, we suggest a committee-based active learning method to reduce the number of clinical experiments required to optimize EDS stimulation variables by exploring the stimulation configuration space more efficiently. We also developed a novel method to dynamically weight the results of different experiments using neural networks to create an optimal estimate of the quantity of interest. The essence of our approach was to use machine learning methods to predict the hand contraction force in a patient with chronic SCI based on different EDS parameters. The accuracy of the prediction of stimulation outcomes was evaluated based on three measurements: mean absolute error, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient. The results show that the proposed method can be used to reliably predict the outcome of cervical EDS on maximum voluntary contraction force of the hand with a prediction error of approximately 15%. This model could allow scientists to establish stimulation parameters more efficiently for SCI patients to produce enhanced motor responses in this novel application.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/341701v1?rss=1">Cable Energy Function of Cortical Axons: Equivalent Formulas</a></h4>

Cortical neurons generally have rich morphologies in dendrite arbor and axonal branches, which make it difficulty in estimate energy consumption during action potential (AP) propagation in neuronal communication. It is an unsolved issue in driving general analytical equations to estimate energy cost for those axons and dendrites with different terminations. Most previous energy calculations of AP-related metabolic cost are still based on the Na^+-counting method. Here, we apply principles of physics and mathematical analysis to construct several forms of cable energy function of AP conduction along axons with different boundary conditions. These derived energy equations extend Hodgkin-Huxley theory and prove to be highly more accurate in estimation the energy consumption during AP propagation along cortical axons and dendrites with any kind of ion channels than that using the Na^+-counting method.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/341495v1?rss=1">Kernel machine tests of association between brain networks and phenotypes</a></h4>

Applications of quantitative network analysis to functional brain connectivity have become popular in the last decade due to their ability to describe the general topological principles of brain networks. However, many issues arise when standard statistical analysis techniques are applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity maps. Frequently, summary measures of these maps, such as global efficiency and clustering coefficients, collapse the changing structures of graph topology from many scales to one. This can result in a loss of whole-brain spatio-temporal pattern information that may be significant in association and prediction analyses. Drawing from the electrical engineering field, the resistance perturbation distance is a quantification of similarity between graphs on the same vertex set that has been shown to identify changes in dynamic graphs, such as those from fMRI, while not being computationally expensive or result in a loss of information. This work proposes a novel kernel-based regression scheme that incorporates the resistance perturbation distance to better understand the association with biological phenotypes from fMRI using both simulated and real datasets.

NMDA receptors are important for cognition and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. GluN1 knockdown (GluN1KD) mice have reduced NMDA receptor levels, striatal spine density deficits, and cognitive impairments. However, how NMDA depletion leads to these effects is unclear. Since Rho GTPases are known to regulate spine density and cognition, we examined the levels of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 signaling proteins. Striatal Rac1-pathway components are reduced in GluN1KD mice, with Rac1 and WAVE-1 deficits at 6 and 12 weeks of age. Concurrently, medium spiny neuron (MSN) spine density deficits are present in mice at these ages. To determine whether WAVE-1 deficits were causal or compensatory in relation to these phenotypes, we intercrossed GluN1KD mice with WAVE-1 overexpressing (WAVE-Tg) mice to restore WAVE-1 levels. GluN1KD-WAVE-Tg hybrids showed rescue of striatal WAVE-1 protein levels and MSN spine density, as well as selective behavioral rescue in the Y-maze and 8-arm radial maze tests. GluN1KD-WAVE-Tg mice expressed normalized WAVE-1 protein levels in the hippocampus, yet spine density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was not significantly altered. Our data suggest a nuanced role for WAVE-1 effects on cognition and a delineation of specific cognitive domains served by the striatum. Rescue of striatal WAVE-1 and MSN spine density may be significant for goal-directed exploration and associated long-term memory in mice.

A growing body of literature has demonstrated the potential for ketamine in the treatment of major depression. Sub-anesthetic doses produce rapid and sustained changes in depressive behavior, both in patients and rodent models, associated with reorganization of glutamatergic synapses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). While ketamine is known to regulate NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), the full complement of downstream cellular consequences for ketamine administration are not well understood. Here, we combine electrophysiology with 2-photon imaging and glutamate uncaging in acute slices of mouse PFC to further examine how ketamine alters glutamatergic synaptic transmission. We find that four hours after ketamine treatment, glutamatergic synapses themselves are not significantly affected. However, expression levels of the neuromodulatory Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS4) are dramatically reduced. This loss of RGS4 activity disrupts the normal compartmentalization of synaptic neuromodulation. Thus, under control conditions, alpha2 adrenergic receptors and GABAb receptors selectively inhibit AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and NMDARs, respectively. After ketamine-induced loss of RGS4 activity, this selectivity is lost, with both modulatory systems broadly inhibiting glutamatergic transmission. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which ketamine can influence synaptic signaling and provide new avenues for the exploration of therapeutics directed at treating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression.

In many species, survival depends on olfaction, yet the mechanisms that underlie olfactory sensitivity are not well understood. Here, we examine how a conserved subset of olfactory receptors, the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) determine odor detection thresholds of mice to amines. We find that deleting all TAARs, or even single TAARs, results in significant odor detection deficits. This finding is not limited to TAARs, as the deletion of a canonical odorant receptor reduced behavioral sensitivity to its preferred ligand. Remarkably, behavioral threshold is set solely by the most sensitive receptor, with no contribution from other highly sensitive receptors. In addition, increasing the number of sensory neurons (and glomeruli) expressing a threshold-determining TAAR does not improve detection, indicating that sensitivity is not limited by the typical complement of sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrate that olfactory thresholds are set by the single highest affinity receptor, and suggest that TAARs are evolutionarily conserved because they determine the sensitivity to a class of biologically relevant chemicals.

Volume electron microscopy (3D EM) has enabled the dense reconstruction of neuronal circuits in datasets that are so far about a few hundred micrometers in extent. In mammalian brains, most neuronal circuits are however highly non-local, such that a large fraction of the synapses in such a volume of neuropil originates from distant projection sources. The labeling and identification of such long-range axonal inputs from multiple sources within a densely reconstructed EM dataset has been notoriously difficult because of the limited color label space of EM. Here, we present FluoEM, a set of experimental and computational methods that allows the identification of multi-color fluorescently labeled axons in dense EM data without the need for artificially introduced fiducial marks or direct label conversion for EM. The approach is based on correlated imaging of the tissue and computational matching of neurite reconstructions, amounting to a virtual color labeling of axons in dense EM circuit data. We show that the identification of fluorescent light- microscopically (LM) imaged axons in 3D EM data from mouse cortex is faithfully possible as soon as the EM dataset is about 40-50 micrometers in extent, relying on the unique trajectories of axons in dense mammalian neuropil. The method is exemplified for the identification of long-distance axonal input into layer 1 of the mouse cerebral cortex.

The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a ventral midline thalamic nucleus that interconnects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC). Considerable data indicate that HPC-mPFC circuits are involved in contextual and spatial memory, however, it is not clear whether the RE mediates the acquisition or retrieval of these memories. To examine this question, we inactivated the RE with muscimol before either the acquisition or retrieval of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats; freezing served as the index of fear. We found that RE inactivation before conditioning impaired contextual freezing during retrieval testing in the conditioning context. Interestingly, this impairment was absent when retrieval testing was also conducted after RE inactivation. Inactivation of the RE alone did not affect the expression of context freezing, though it did increase the generalization of freezing to a novel context. Muscimol inactivation of the RE did not affect either the acquisition or expression of auditory fear conditioning. Together, these data reveal that the RE supports the encoding of precise contextual memories that allow discrimination of dangerous from safe contexts. When the RE is inactive, however, alternate neural systems acquire an impoverished and state-dependent contextual memory that is only expressed when the RE is offline.

Objective: A major goal in systems neuroscience is to determine the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior. To this end, methods that combine monitoring neural activity, behavioral tracking, and targeted manipulation of neurons in closed-loop are powerful tools. However, commercial systems that allow these types of experiments are usually expensive and rely on non-standardized data formats and proprietary software which may hinder user-modifications for specific needs. In order to promote reproducibility and data-sharing in science, transparent software and standardized data formats are an advantage. Here, we present an open source, low-cost, adaptable, and easy to set-up system for combined behavioral tracking, electrophysiology and closed-loop stimulation. Approach: Based on the Open Ephys system (www.open-ephys.org) we developed multiple modules to include real-time tracking and behavioral-based closed-loop stimulation. We describe the equipment and provide a step by step guide to set up the system. Combining the open source software Bonsai (bonsai-rx.org) for analyzing camera images in real-time with the newly developed modules in Open Ephys, we acquire position information, visualize tracking, and perform tracking-based closed-loop stimulation experiments. To analyze the acquired data we provide an open source file reading package in Python. Main results: The system robustly visualizes real-time tracking and reliably recover tracking information recorded from a range of sampling frequencies (30-1000Hz). We combined electrophysiology with the newly developed tracking modules in Open Ephys to record place cell and grid cell activity in the hippocampus and in the medial entorhinal cortex, respectively. Moreover, we present a case in which we used the system for closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal grid cells. Significance: Expanding the Open Ephys system to include animal tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation extends the availability of high-quality, low-cost experimental setup within standardized data formats serving the neuroscience community.

Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder, in which the primary symptom is a prominent, involuntary 4-10 Hz rhythmic movement. The presence of tremor frequency activity in the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) is well established, but it is often assumed that it is driven by cerebellar tremor frequency activity, while the role of intrinsic oscillatory activity in VIM is not clear. An improved understanding of the mechanisms of tremor and non-tremor activity in the VIM may lead to better pharmacological and neuromodulatory therapies. We recorded local field activity during tremor in the VIM from 5 patients during deep brain electrode implantation surgery to constrain a biophysically-principled computational model of tremor field activity in the VIM, coupled with the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We compared tremor frequency activity in the model generated either by extrinsic tremor-periodic drive or by intrinsic VIM-TRN interaction. Extrinsic and intrinsic tremor frequency oscillations in the model depended on T-type Ca2+ channels in different ways. Both also depended on GABA modulation in a site- and type-specific manner. These results suggested that efficacy of pharmacological manipulations may depend upon the mechanisms generating tremor activity in VIM. Simulated non-tremor-related cerebellar drive decreased extrinsic tremor activity but increased intrinsic tremor activity. Intrinsic tremor power was increased with an external tremor frequency drive, suggesting that both mechanisms may be important to understand the emergence and cessation of tremor activity in VIM. Our results lead to experimentally testable predictions on modulating tremor frequency activity that can help to improve future treatment strategies for ET.

Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, is a fundamental process underlying several physiological functions such as touch and pain sensing, hearing and proprioception. This process is carried out by specialized mechanosensitive ion channels whose identities have been discovered for most functions except pain sensing. Here we report the identification of TACAN (Tmem120A), an essential subunit of the mechanosensitive ion channel responsible for sensing mechanical pain. TACAN is expressed in a subset of nociceptors, and its expression increases mechanically-evoked currents in cell lines. Mutagenesis of putative pore-lining residues or reconstitution of purified TACAN in synthetic lipids reveals that TACAN forms a functional ion channel. Finally, knocking down TACAN decreases the mechanosensitivity of nociceptors and reduces behavioral responses to mechanical but not thermal painful stimuli, without affecting the sensitivity to touch. We propose that TACAN is a pore-forming subunit of the mechanosensitive ion channel responsible for sensing mechanical pain.

Electrical stimulation of the brain has become a mainstay of fundamental neuroscience research and an increasingly prevalent clinical therapy. Despite decades of use in basic neuroscience research over acute time scales, and the growing prevalence of neuromodulation therapies, gaps in knowledge regarding activation or inactivation of neural elements over time in the vicinity of the electrode limit the ability to adequately interpret evoked downstream responses or fine-tune stimulation parameters to focus on the desired response. In this work, in vivo two-photon microscopy was used to image Thy1-GCaMP activity in Layer 2/3 neurons of S1 cortex during 30 s of continuous electrical stimulation at varying frequencies. We show that during continuous stimulation, stimulation frequency influences a distinct spatial and temporal pattern of somatic activation. Our results elucidate conflicting results from prior studies reporting either dense spherical activation of somas biased towards somas near the electrode, or sparse activation of somas at a distance via axons near the electrode. These findings indicate that the neural element specific temporal response local to the stimulating electrode as a function of changes in charge density applied, frequency and temporal patterning need to be considered to properly interpret downstream circuit responses for basic science understanding, or determining mechanisms of action for clinical therapeutic applications.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337360v1?rss=1">Correction of respiratory artifacts in MRI head motion estimates</a></h4>

Head motion represents one of the greatest technical obstacles for brain MRI. Accurate detection of artifacts induced by head motion requires precise estimation of movement. However, this estimation may be corrupted by factitious effects owing to main field fluctuations generated by body motion. In the current report, we examine head motion estimation in multiband resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study and a comparison 'single-shot' dataset from Oregon Health &amp; Science University. We show unequivocally that respirations contaminate movement estimates in functional MRI and that respiration generates apparent head motion not associated with degraded quality of functional MRI. We have developed a novel approach using a band-stop filter that accurately removes these respiratory effects. Subsequently, we demonstrate that utilizing this filter improves post-processing data quality. Lastly, we demonstrate the real-time implementation of motion estimate filtering in our FIRMM (Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring) software package.

<p>by Kumaresan Jayaraman, Alex N. Morley, Daniel Szöllősi, Tjerk A. Wassenaar, Harald H. Sitte, Thomas Stockner</p>

The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) is located on presynaptic neurons, where it plays an essential role in limiting dopaminergic signaling by temporarily curtailing high neurotransmitter concentration through rapid re-uptake. Transport by hDAT is energized by transmembrane ionic gradients. Dysfunction of this transporter leads to disease states, such as Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder or depression. It has been shown that hDAT and other members of the monoamine transporter family exist in oligomeric forms at the plasma membrane. Several residues are known to be involved in oligomerization, but interaction interfaces, oligomer orientation and the quarternary arrangement in the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. Here we examine oligomeric forms of hDAT using a direct approach, by following dimerization of two randomly-oriented hDAT transporters in 512 independent simulations, each being 2 μs in length. We employed the DAFT (docking assay for transmembrane components) approach, which is an unbiased molecular dynamics simulation method to identify oligomers, their conformations and populations. The overall ensemble of a total of &gt;1 ms simulation time revealed a limited number of symmetric and asymmetric dimers. The identified dimer interfaces include all residues known to be involved in dimerization. Importantly, we find that the surface of the bundle domain is largely excluded from engaging in dimeric interfaces. Such an interaction would typically lead to inhibition by stabilization of one conformation, while substrate transport relies on a large scale rotation between the inward-facing and the outward-facing state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkmGr5vNPfk" width="1" />

<p>by Lucas Boczkowski, Emanuele Natale, Ofer Feinerman, Amos Korman</p>

Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. We study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task. We present an impossibility result which strongly restricts reliable rumor spreading in such groups. Namely, we prove that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources—a process which requires linear time in the population size. Our results imply that in order to achieve efficient rumor spread a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We then corroborate this claim by providing new analyses of experimental data regarding recruitment in <i>Cataglyphis niger</i> desert ants. Finally, in light of our theoretical results, we discuss strategies to overcome noise in other biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-ijtk1KgGA" width="1" />

As data for microbial community structures found in various environments has increased, studies have examined the relationship between environmental labels given to retrieved microbial samples and their community structures. However, because environments continuously change over time and space, mixed states of some environments and its effects on community formation should be considered, instead of evaluating effects of discrete environmental categories. Here we applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to paired datasets containing more than 30,000 samples of microbial community structures and sample description documents. From the training results, we extracted latent environmental topics that associate co-occurring microbes with co-occurring word sets among samples. Topics are the core elements of environmental mixtures and the visualization of topic-based samples clarifies the connections of various environments. Based on the model training results, we developed a web application, LEA (Latent Environment Allocation), which provides the way to evaluate typicality and heterogeneity of microbial communities in newly obtained samples without confining environmental categories to be compared. Because topics link words and microbes, LEA also enables to search samples semantically related to the query out of 30,000 microbiome samples.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o92_2kUTykI" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex nonlinear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong–Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters that can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.</p>

<p>LIM-domain containing transcription factors (LIM-TFs) are conserved factors important for embryogenesis. The specificity of these factors in transcriptional regulation is conferred by the complexes that they form with other proteins such as LIM-domain-binding (Ldb) proteins and LIM-domain only (LMO) proteins. Unlike LIM-TFs, these proteins do not bind DNA directly. LMO proteins are negative regulators of LIM-TFs and function by competing with LIM-TFs for binding to Ldb's. Although the LIM-TF Lmx1a is expressed in the developing mouse hindbrain, which provides many of the extrinsic signals for inner ear formation, conditional knock-out embryos of both sexes show that the inner ear source of Lmx1a is the major contributor of ear patterning. In addition, we have found that the reciprocal interaction between Lmx1a and Lmo4 (a LMO protein within the inner ear) mediates the formation of both vestibular and auditory structures. Lmo4 negatively regulates Lmx1a to form the three sensory cristae, the anterior semicircular canal, and the shape of the utricle in the vestibule. Furthermore, this negative regulation blocks ectopic sensory formation in the cochlea. In contrast, Lmx1a negatively regulates Lmo4 in mediating epithelial resorption of the canal pouch, which gives rise to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals. We also found that Lmx1a is independently required for the formation of the endolymphatic duct and hair cells in the basal cochlear region.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian inner ear is a structurally complex organ responsible for detecting sound and maintaining balance. Failure to form the intricate 3D structure of this organ properly during development most likely will result in sensory deficits on some level. Here, we provide genetic evidence that a transcription factor, Lmx1a, interacts with its negative regulator, Lmo4, to pattern various vestibular and auditory components of the mammalian inner ear. Identifying these key molecules that mediate formation of this important sensory organ will be helpful for designing strategies and therapeutics to alleviate hearing loss and balance disorders.</p>

<p>BDNF is a growth factor with important roles in the nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions, but the mechanisms controlling its secretion are not completely understood. Here, we show that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion in neurons from the CNS and PNS. Downregulation of the ARMS/Kidins220 protein in the adult mouse brain increases regulated BDNF secretion, leading to its accumulation in the striatum. Interestingly, two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) showed increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and regulated BDNF secretion deficits. Importantly, reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 in hippocampal slices from HD mice reversed the impaired regulated BDNF release. Moreover, there are increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and PFC of patients with HD. ARMS/Kidins220 regulates Synaptotagmin-IV levels, which has been previously observed to modulate BDNF secretion. These data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 controls the regulated secretion of BDNF and might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> BDNF is an important growth factor that plays a fundamental role in the correct functioning of the CNS. The secretion of BDNF must be properly controlled to exert its functions, but the proteins regulating its release are not completely known. Using neuronal cultures and a new conditional mouse to modulate ARMS/Kidins220 protein, we report that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion. Moreover, ARMS/Kidins220 is overexpressed in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD), causing an impaired regulation of BDNF secretion. Furthermore, ARMS/Kidins220 levels are increased in brain samples from HD patients. Future studies should address whether ARMS/Kidins220 has any function on the pathophysiology of HD.</p>

<p>Severed axon tips reform growth cones following spinal cord injury that fail to regenerate, in part, because they become embedded within an inhibitory extracellular matrix. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are the major axon inhibitory matrix component that is increased within the lesion scar and in perineuronal nets around deafferented neurons. We have recently developed a novel peptide modulator (intracellular sigma peptide) of the cognate receptor of CSPGs, protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP), which has been shown to markedly improve sensorimotor function, micturition, and coordinated locomotor behavior in spinal cord contused rats. However, the mechanism(s) underlying how modulation of RPTP mediates axon outgrowth through inhibitory CSPGs remain unclear. Here, we describe how intracellular sigma peptide modulation of RPTP induces enhanced protease Cathepsin B activity. Using DRG neurons from female Sprague Dawley rats cultured on an aggrecan/laminin spot assay and a combination of biochemical techniques, we provide evidence suggesting that modulation of RPTP regulates secretion of proteases that, in turn, relieves CSPG inhibition through its digestion to allow axon migration though proteoglycan barriers. Understanding the mechanisms underlying RPTP modulation elucidates how axon regeneration is impaired by proteoglycans but can then be facilitated following injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Following spinal cord injury, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) upregulate and potently inhibit axon regeneration and functional recovery. Protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP) has been identified as a critical cognate receptor of CSPGs. We have previously characterized a synthetic peptide (intracellular sigma peptide) that targets the regulatory intracellular domain of the receptor to allow axons to regenerate despite the presence of CSPGs. Here, we have found that one important mechanism by which peptide modulation of the receptor enhances axon outgrowth is through secretion of a protease, Cathepsin B, which enables digestion of CSPGs. This work links protease secretion to the CSPG receptor RPTP for the first time with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neural regeneration and plasticity.</p>

<p>How does human brain stimulation result in lasting changes in cortical excitability? Uncertainty on this question hinders the development of personalized brain stimulation therapies. To characterize how cortical excitability is altered by stimulation, we applied repetitive direct electrical stimulation in eight human subjects (male and female) undergoing intracranial monitoring. We evaluated single-pulse corticocortical-evoked potentials (CCEPs) before and after repetitive stimulation across prefrontal (<i>n</i> = 4), temporal (<i>n</i> = 1), and motor (<i>n</i> = 3) cortices. We asked whether a single session of repetitive stimulation was sufficient to induce excitability changes across distributed cortical sites. We found a subset of regions at which 10 Hz prefrontal repetitive stimulation resulted in both potentiation and suppression of excitability that persisted for at least 10 min. We then asked whether these dynamics could be modeled by the prestimulation connectivity profile of each subject. We found that cortical regions (1) anatomically close to the stimulated site and (2) exhibiting high-amplitude CCEPs underwent changes in excitability following repetitive stimulation. We demonstrate high accuracy (72–95%) and discriminability (81–99%) in predicting regions exhibiting changes using individual subjects' prestimulation connectivity profile, and show that adding prestimulation connectivity features significantly improved model performance. The same features predicted regions of modulation following motor and temporal cortices stimulation in an independent dataset. Together, baseline connectivity profile can be used to predict regions susceptible to brain changes and provides a basis for personalizing brain stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain stimulation is increasingly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders by inducing excitability changes at specific brain regions. However, our understanding of how, when, and where these changes are induced is critically lacking. We inferred plasticity in the human brain after applying electrical stimulation to the brain's surface and measuring changes in excitability. We observed excitability changes in regions anatomically and functionally closer to the stimulation site. Those in responsive regions were accurately predicted using a classifier trained on baseline brain network characteristics. Finally, we showed that the excitability changes can potentially be monitored in real-time. These results begin to fill basic gaps in our understanding of stimulation-induced brain dynamics in humans and offer pathways to optimize stimulation protocols.</p>

<p>The present study demonstrates HIV-1 Tat-mediated epigenetic downregulation of microglial miR-124 and its association with microglial activation. Exposure of mouse primary microglia isolated from newborn pups of either sex to HIV-1 Tat resulted in decreased expression of primary miR-124-1, primary miR-124-2 as well as the mature miR-124. In parallel, HIV-1 Tat exposure to mouse primary microglial cells resulted in increased expression of DNA methylation enzymes, such as DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, which were also accompanied by increased global DNA methylation. Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA sequencing in the HIV-1 Tat-exposed mouse primary microglial cells further confirmed increased DNA methylation of the primary miR-124-1 and primary miR-124-2 promoters. Bioinformatic analyses identified MECP2 as a novel 3'-UTR target of miR-124. This was further validated in mouse primary microglial cells wherein HIV-1 Tat-mediated downregulation of miR-124 resulted in increased expression of MECP2, leading in turn to further repression of miR-124 via the feedback loop. In addition to MECP2, miR-124 also modulated the levels of STAT3 through its binding to the 3'-UTR, leading to microglial activation. Luciferase assays and Ago2 immunoprecipitation determined the direct binding between miR-124 and 3'-UTR of both MECP2 and STAT3. Gene silencing of <i>MECP2</i> and <i>DNMT1</i> and overexpression of miR-124 blocked HIV-1 Tat-mediated downregulation of miR-124 and microglial activation. <i>In vitro</i> findings were also confirmed in the basal ganglia of SIV-infected rhesus macaques (both sexes). In summary, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of HIV-1 Tat-mediated activation of microglia via downregulation of miR-124, leading ultimately to increased MECP2 and STAT3 signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy in controlling viremia, the CNS continues to harbor viral reservoirs. The persistence of low-level virus replication leads to the accumulation of early viral proteins, including HIV-1 Tat protein. Understanding the epigenetic/molecular mechanism(s) by which viral proteins, such as HIV-1 Tat, can activate microglia is thus of paramount importance. This study demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat-mediated DNA methylation of the miR-124 promoter leads to its downregulation with a concomitant upregulation of the MECP2-STAT3-IL6, resulting in microglial activation. These findings reveal an unexplored epigenetic/molecular mechanism(s) underlying HIV-1 Tat-mediated microglial activation, thereby providing a potential target for the development of therapeutics aimed at ameliorating microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the context of HIV-1 infection.</p>

<p>Transporter-mediated glutamate uptake plays an essential role in shaping synaptic neurotransmission. The rapid removal of synaptically released glutamate ensures the high temporal dynamics characteristic of fast excitatory chemical neurotransmission and prevents the overexcitation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors that have been implicated in synaptic plasticity impairments and cell death. Despite clear regional differences in plasticity and excitotoxic thresholds, few studies have compared extracellular glutamate dynamics across different brain regions and in response to a range of neural activity including plasticity-inducing stimuli. Here, we used the rapid extracellular fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter) and high-speed imaging (205 frames per second) to quantify relative differences in glutamate clearance rates over a wide range of presynaptic activity <i>in situ</i> in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum of male C57/BL6NCrl mice. We found that the hippocampus was significantly more efficient than the cortex and striatum at clearing synaptically released glutamate and that this efficiency could be attributed, at least in part, to faster glutamate diffusion away from the release site. In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibition of GLT-1, the brain's most abundant glutamate transporter, slowed clearance rates to only a fraction (~20–25%) of the effect induced by nonselective transporter blockade, regardless of the brain region and the duration of presynaptic activity. In all, our data reveal clear regional differences in glutamate dynamics after neural activity and suggest that non-GLT-1 transporters can make a large contribution to the rate of glutamate clearance in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Glutamate is the brain's most abundant neurotransmitter, and although essential for rapid cell–cell communication, too much glutamate can negatively impact cellular health. Extracellular glutamate levels are tightly regulated by membrane-bound transporters that rapidly remove the glutamate that is released during neural activity, thereby shaping both the spatial and temporal dynamics of excitatory neurotransmission. Using high-speed imaging of an optical sensor of extracellular glutamate, we show that glutamate dynamics vary widely from one brain region to the next and are highly dependent on the duration of synaptic activity. Our data demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of glutamate regulation in the brain and suggest that such regional differences can dramatically affect both the localization and duration of postsynaptic receptor activation during synaptic neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Cholinergic afferents from the basal forebrain (BF) can influence cortical activity on rapid time scales, enabling sensory information processing and exploratory behavior. However, our understanding of how synaptically released acetylcholine (ACh) influences cellular targets in distinct cortical layers remains incomplete. Previous studies have shown that rapid changes in cortical dynamics induced by phasic BF activity can be mediated by the activation of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) expressed in distinct types of GABAergic interneurons. In contrast, muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) are assumed to be involved in slower and more diffuse ACh signaling following sustained increases in afferent activity. Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying fast cholinergic control of cortical circuit dynamics by pairing optical stimulation of cholinergic afferents with evoked activity in somatosensory cortical slices of mice of either sex. ACh release evoked by single stimuli led to a rapid and persistent suppression of cortical activity, mediated by mAChRs expressed in layer 4 and to a lesser extent, by nAChRs in layers 1–3. In agreement, we found that cholinergic inputs to layer 4 evoked short-latency and long-lasting mAChR-dependent inhibition of the large majority of excitatory neurons, whereas inputs to layers 1–3 primarily evoked nAChR-dependent excitation of different classes of interneurons. Our results indicate that the rapid cholinergic control of cortical network dynamics is mediated by both nAChRs and mAChRs-dependent mechanisms, which are expressed in distinct cortical layers and cell types.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine (ACh) release from basal forebrain (BF) afferents to cortex influences a variety of cognitive functions including attention, sensory processing, and learning. Cholinergic control occurs on the time scale of seconds and is mediated by BF neurons that generate action potentials at low rates, indicating that ACh acts as a point-to-point neurotransmitter. Our findings highlight that even brief activation of cholinergic afferents can recruit both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors expressed in several cell types, leading to modulation of cortical activity on distinct time scales. Furthermore, they indicate that the initial stages of cortical sensory processing are under direct cholinergic control.</p>

<p>To identify mechanisms of behavioral evolution, we investigated the hindbrain circuit that generates distinct vocal patterns in two closely related frog species. Male <i>Xenopus laevis</i> and <i>Xenopus petersii</i> produce courtship calls that include a fast trill: trains of ~60 Hz sound pulses. Although fast trill rates are similar, <i>X. laevis</i> fast trills have a longer duration and period than those of <i>X. petersii</i>. To pinpoint the neural basis of these differences, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a key premotor hindbrain nucleus (the <i>Xenopus</i> parabrachial area, PB<sub>X</sub>) in <i>ex vivo</i> brains that produce fictive vocalizations, vocal nerve activity corresponding to advertisement call patterns. We found two populations of PB<sub>X</sub> neurons with distinct properties: fast trill neurons (FTNs) and early vocal neurons (EVNs). FTNs, but not EVNs, appear to be intrinsically tuned to produce each species' call patterns because: (1) <i>X. laevis</i> FTNs generate longer and slower depolarizations than <i>X. petersii</i> FTNs during their respective fictive vocalizations, (2) current steps in FTNs induce burst durations that are significantly longer in <i>X. laevis</i> than <i>X. petersii</i>, and (3) synaptically isolated FTNs oscillate in response to NMDA in a species-specific manner: longer and slower in <i>X. laevis</i> than in <i>X. petersii</i>. Therefore, divergence of premotor neuron membrane properties is a strong candidate for generating vocal differences between species.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The vertebrate hindbrain includes multiple neural circuits that generate rhythmic behaviors including vocalizations. Male African clawed frogs produce courtship calls that are unique to each species and differ in temporal patterns. Here, we identified two functional subtypes of neurons located in the parabrachial nucleus: a hindbrain region implicated in vocal and respiratory control across vertebrates. One of these neuronal subtypes exhibits distinct properties across species that can account for the evolutionary divergence of song patterns. Our results suggest that changes to this group of neurons during evolution may have had a major role in establishing novel behaviors in closely related species.</p>

<p>Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B) and triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter release. Here, we show that <i>snt-1</i>, the homolog of mammalian Syt1, functions as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for both tonic and evoked neurotransmitter release at the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuromuscular junction. Mutations that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in double C2 domains of SNT-1 significantly impaired tonic release, whereas disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in a single C2 domain had no effect, indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding of the two C2 domains is functionally redundant for tonic release. Stimulus-evoked release was significantly reduced in <i>snt-1</i> mutants, with prolonged release latency as well as faster rise and decay kinetics. Unlike tonic release, evoked release was triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding solely to the C2B domain. Moreover, we showed that SNT-1 plays an essential role in the priming process in different subpopulations of synaptic vesicles with tight or loose coupling to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We showed that SNT-1 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> regulates evoked neurotransmitter release through Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to its C2B domain in a similar way to Syt1 in the mouse CNS and the fly neuromuscular junction. However, the largely decreased tonic release in <i>snt-1</i> mutants argues SNT-1 has a clamping function. Indeed, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mutations in the C2 domains in SNT-1 significantly reduced the frequency of the miniature EPSC, indicating that SNT-1 also acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for tonic release. Therefore, revealing the differential mechanisms between invertebrates and vertebrates will provide significant insights into our understanding how synaptic vesicle fusion is regulated.</p>

<p>Disruptions of dopamine (DA) signaling contribute to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Despite evidence that risk for these disorders derives from heritable variation in DA-linked genes, a better understanding is needed of the molecular and circuit context through which gene variation drives distinct disease traits. Previously, we identified the DA transporter (DAT) variant Val559 in subjects with ADHD and established that the mutation supports anomalous DAT-mediated DA efflux (ADE). Here, we demonstrate that region-specific contributions of D<sub>2</sub> autoreceptors (D2AR) to presynaptic DA homeostasis dictate the consequences of Val559 expression in adolescent male mice. We show that activation of D2ARs in the WT dorsal striatum (DS), but not ventral striatum (VS), increases DAT phosphorylation and surface trafficking. In contrast, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is D2AR-dependent in both regions. In the DS but not VS of Val559 mice, tonic activation of D2ARs drives a positive feedback loop that promotes surface expression of efflux-prone DATs, raising extracellular DA levels and overwhelming DAT-mediated DA clearance capacity. Whereas D2ARs that regulate DAT are tonically activated in the Val559 DS, D2ARs that regulate TH become desensitized, allowing maintenance of cytosolic DA needed to sustain ADE. Together with prior findings, our results argue for distinct D2AR pools that regulate DA synthesis versus DA release and inactivation and offer a clear example of how the penetrance of gene variation can be limited to a subset of expression sites based on differences in intersecting regulatory networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altered dopamine (DA) signaling has been linked to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. In an effort to understand and model disease-associated DAergic disturbances, we previously screened the DA transporter (DAT) in subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and identified multiple, functionally impactful, coding variants. One of these variants, Val559, supports anomalous DA efflux (ADE) and in transgenic mice leads to changes in locomotor patterns, psychostimulant sensitivity, and impulsivity. Here, we show that the penetrance of Val559 ADE is dictated by region-specific differences in how presynaptic D<sub>2</sub>-type autoreceptors (D2ARs) constrain DA signaling, biasing phenotypic effects to dorsal striatal projections. The Val559 model illustrates how the impact of genetic variation underlying neuropsychiatric disorders can be shaped by the differential engagement of synaptic regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>Mutations or altered protein levels of SHANK3 are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Phelan–McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (Guilmatre et al., 2014). Loss of SHANK3 in mouse models results in decreased synapse density and reduction in the levels of multiple synaptic proteins (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013). The family of SHANK scaffolding molecules are among the most heavily ubiquitinated proteins at the postsynaptic density. The ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of SHANK is regulated by synaptic activity and may contribute to activity-dependent synaptic remodeling (Ehlers, 2003; Shin et al., 2012). However, the identity of the specific deubiquitinating enzymes and E3 ligases that regulate SHANK ubiquitination at synapses are unknown. Here we identify USP8/UBPY as a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates SHANK3 and SHANK1 ubiquitination and protein levels. In primary rat neurons, USP8 enhances SHANK3 and SHANK1 protein levels via deubiquitination and increases dendritic spine density. Additionally, USP8 is essential for changes in SHANK3 protein levels following synaptic activity modulation. These data identify USP8 as a key modulator of SHANK3 downstream of synaptic activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Precise regulation of the protein levels of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 is essential for proper neurodevelopment. Mutations of <i>SHANK3</i> have been identified in Phelan–McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (Guilmatre et al., 2014). In this research, we identify USP8 as a key enzyme that regulates SHANK3 protein levels in neurons. USP8 acts to deubiquitinate SHANK3, which prevents its proteasomal-mediated degradation and enhances overall dendritic spine stability. In the future, the modulation of USP8 deubiquitinating activity could potentially be used to titrate the protein levels of SHANK3 to ameliorate disease.</p>

<p>Retinoic acid (RA) and its receptors (RARs) are well established essential transcriptional regulators during embryonic development. Recent findings in cultured neurons identified an independent and critical post-transcriptional role of RA and RARα in the homeostatic regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in mature neurons. However, the functional relevance of synaptic RA signaling <i>in vivo</i> has not been established. Here, using somatosensory cortex as a model system and the RARα conditional knock-out mouse as a tool, we applied multiple genetic manipulations to delete RARα postnatally in specific populations of cortical neurons, and asked whether synaptic RA signaling observed in cultured neurons is involved in cortical information processing <i>in vivo</i>. Indeed, conditional ablation of RARα in mice via a CaMKIIα-Cre or a layer 5-Cre driver line or via somatosensory cortex-specific viral expression of Cre-recombinase impaired whisker-dependent texture discrimination, suggesting a critical requirement of RARα expression in L5 pyramidal neurons of somatosensory cortex for normal tactile sensory processing. Transcranial two-photon imaging revealed a significant increase in dendritic spine elimination on apical dendrites of somatosensory cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in these mice. Interestingly, the enhancement of spine elimination is whisker experience-dependent as whisker trimming rescued the spine elimination phenotype. Additionally, experiencing an enriched environment improved texture discrimination in RARα-deficient mice and reduced excessive spine pruning. Thus, RA signaling is essential for normal experience-dependent cortical circuit remodeling and sensory processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The importance of synaptic RA signaling has been demonstrated in <i>in vitro</i> studies. However, whether RA signaling mediated by RARα contributes to neural circuit functions <i>in vivo</i> remains largely unknown. In this study, using a RARα conditional knock-out mouse, we performed multiple regional/cell-type-specific manipulation of RARα expression in the postnatal brain, and show that RARα signaling contributes to normal whisker-dependent texture discrimination as well as regulating spine dynamics of apical dendrites from layer (L5) pyramidal neurons in S1. Deletion of RARα in excitatory neurons in the forebrain induces elevated spine elimination and impaired sensory discrimination. Our study provides novel insights into the role of RARα signaling in cortical processing and experience-dependent spine maturation.</p>

<p>Visual working memory (VWM) recruits a broad network of brain regions, including prefrontal, parietal, and visual cortices. Recent evidence supports a "sensory recruitment" model of VWM, whereby precise visual details are maintained in the same stimulus-selective regions responsible for perception. A key question in evaluating the sensory recruitment model is how VWM representations persist through distracting visual input, given that the early visual areas that putatively represent VWM content are susceptible to interference from visual stimulation.</p>
<p>To address this question, we used a functional magnetic resonance imaging inverted encoding model approach to quantitatively assess the effect of distractors on VWM representations in early visual cortex and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), another region previously implicated in the storage of VWM information. This approach allowed us to reconstruct VWM representations for orientation, both before and after visual interference, and to examine whether oriented distractors systematically biased these representations. In our human participants (both male and female), we found that orientation information was maintained simultaneously in early visual areas and IPS in anticipation of possible distraction, and these representations persisted in the absence of distraction. Importantly, early visual representations were susceptible to interference; VWM orientations reconstructed from visual cortex were significantly biased toward distractors, corresponding to a small attractive bias in behavior. In contrast, IPS representations did not show such a bias. These results provide quantitative insight into the effect of interference on VWM representations, and they suggest a dynamic tradeoff between visual and parietal regions that allows flexible adaptation to task demands in service of VWM.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite considerable evidence that stimulus-selective visual regions maintain precise visual information in working memory, it remains unclear how these representations persist through subsequent input. Here, we used quantitative model-based fMRI analyses to reconstruct the contents of working memory and examine the effects of distracting input. Although representations in the early visual areas were systematically biased by distractors, those in the intraparietal sulcus appeared distractor-resistant. In contrast, early visual representations were most reliable in the absence of distraction. These results demonstrate the dynamic, adaptive nature of visual working memory processes, and provide quantitative insight into the ways in which representations can be affected by interference. Further, they suggest that current models of working memory should be revised to incorporate this flexibility.</p>

<p>Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is commonly observed in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as in nonclinical populations with stress-related mental-health problems. However, the exact circuitry mechanisms underlying SIB have remained poorly understood. Here, with bilateral injection of muscimol into the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), we established a rat model of SIB. Following the muscimol injection, the male rats exhibited in a dose-dependent manner stereotypic self-biting behavior that lasted for hours and often resulted in wounds of various severities. The SIB was associated with an elevated level of serum corticosterone and could be exacerbated by enhancing the corticosterone signaling and, conversely, alleviated by inhibiting the corticosterone signaling. Activity mapping using c-fos immunostaining, combined with connectivity mapping using herpes simplex virus-based anterograde tracing from the EP and pseudorabies virus-based retrograde tracing from the masseter muscle, revealed the potential involvement of many brain areas in SIB. In particular, the lateral habenula (LHb) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the two connected brain areas involved in stress response and reward processing, showed a significant increase in neuronal activation during SIB. Furthermore, suppressing the LHb activity or modulating the GABAergic transmission in the VTA could significantly reduce the occurrence of SIB. These results demonstrate the importance of stress hormone signaling and the LHb–VTA circuit in modulating SIB resulting from EP malfunction, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention of SIB and related disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Self-injurious behavior (SIB) occurs in ~4% of the general population, with substantially higher occurrence among adolescents and patients of neuropsychiatric disorders. Stress has been linked to the occurrence of SIB, yet the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Using a rat model of SIB induced by disruption of activity in the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), we found that the behavior is regulated by stress and linked to corticosterone signaling. Viral tracing and c-fos immunostaining revealed the involvement of various subcortical areas, especially the EP–lateral habenula (LHb)–ventral tegmental area (VTA) circuit, in SIB. Furthermore, regulating activity in the LHb or the VTA alleviates SIB. These results may have implications in the development of new strategies for treating SIB.</p>

<p>Neural progenitor cells in the developing dorsal forebrain give rise to excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes for the neocortex. While we are starting to gain a better understanding about the mechanisms that direct the formation of neocortical neurons and astrocytes, far less is known about the molecular mechanisms that instruct dorsal forebrain progenitors to make oligodendrocytes. In this study, we show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is required in dorsal progenitors for their late embryonic transition to oligodendrogenesis. Using genetic lineage-tracing in mice of both sexes, we demonstrate that most oligodendrocytes in the embryonic neocortex derive from Emx1<sup>+</sup> dorsal forebrain progenitors. Deletion of the Shh signaling effector <i>Smo</i> specifically in Emx1<sup>+</sup> progenitors led to significantly decreased oligodendrocyte numbers in the embryonic neocortex. Conversely, knock-out of the Shh antagonist <i>Sufu</i> was sufficient to increase neocortical oligodendrogenesis. Using conditional knock-out strategies, we found that Shh ligand is supplied to dorsal progenitors through multiple sources. Loss of <i>Shh</i> from Dlx5/6<sup>+</sup> interneurons caused a significant reduction in oligodendrocytes in the embryonic neocortex. This phenotype was identical to that observed upon <i>Shh</i> deletion from the entire CNS using <i>Nestin-Cre</i>, indicating that interneurons migrating into the neocortex from the subpallium are the primary neural source of Shh for dorsal oligodendrogenesis. Additionally, deletion of <i>Shh</i> from migrating interneurons together with the choroid plexus epithelium led to a more severe loss of oligodendrocytes, suggesting that the choroid plexus is an important non-neural source of Shh ligand. Together, our studies demonstrate that the dorsal wave of neocortical oligodendrogenesis occurs earlier than previously appreciated and requires highly regulated Shh signaling from multiple embryonic sources.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most neocortical oligodendrocytes are made by neural progenitors in the dorsal forebrain, but the mechanisms that specify this fate are poorly understood. This study identifies Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling as a critical pathway in the transition from neurogenesis to oligodendrogenesis in dorsal forebrain progenitors during late embryonic development. The timing of this neuron-to-glia "switch" coincides with the arrival of migrating interneurons into the dorsal germinal zone, which we identify as a critical source of Shh ligand, which drives oligodendrogenesis. Our data provide evidence for a new model in which Shh signaling increases in the dorsal forebrain late in embryonic development to provide a temporally regulated mechanism that initiates the third wave of neocortical oligodendrogenesis.</p>

Abstract<p>Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: 1) <i>Onset latency,</i> time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli, and 2) <i>selection latency,</i> time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones, yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations (‘coos’). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Auditory core (A1) and lateral belt (LB) areas are key subdivisions of auditory cortex. A1 plays crucial role in processing of simple stimuli such as pure tones whereas LB for processing of complex sounds. Both areas receive direct inputs from medial geniculate nucleus and have recurrent connections. Nonetheless, the functional connectivity patterns between these subdivisions while processing different sound categories are poorly understood. Using simultaneous spike-LFP recordings our study reveals that information about the presence of a stimuli in the environment arrive concurrently in core and LB, however the information related to neuronal discrimination may arrive at different times indicating both parallel and serial information transmission pathways exist and their presence is guided by the context of the task.</p>

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming increasingly popular
models to predict neural responses in visual cortex. However, contextual
effects, which are prevalent in neural processing and in perception, are not
explicitly handled by current CNNs, including those used for neural prediction.
In primary visual cortex, neural responses are modulated by stimuli spatially
surrounding the classical receptive field in rich ways. These effects have been
modeled with divisive normalization approaches, including flexible models where
spatial normalization is recruited only to the degree responses from center and
surround locations are deemed statistically dependent. We propose a flexible
normalization model applied to mid-level representations of deep CNNs as a
tractable way to study contextual normalization mechanisms in mid-level visual
areas. This approach captures non-trivial spatial dependencies among mid-level
features in CNNs, such as those present in textures and other visual stimuli
that arise from tiling high order features, geometrically. We expect that the
proposed approach can make predictions about when spatial normalization might
be recruited in mid-level cortical areas. We also expect this approach to be
useful as part of the CNN toolkit, therefore going beyond more restrictive
fixed forms of normalization.

<p>How stable and general is behavior once reached maximum learning? To answer
this question and understand post-acquisition behavior and its related
individual differences, we explore analytic models of Pavlovian conditioning
extending the basic associative model of Hull (i.e., the Rescorla-Wagner model
with just one cue) and propose three new models valid for individual data,
which we argue to be quite natural. The first two are descriptive settings: (i)
a framework of dynamical models inspired by the classical mechanics of a
particle in a given potential, which comprises Hull model and also a specific
model encoding resistance to learning in the first few sessions followed by an
over-optimal response peak; (ii) the most direct stochastic extension of Hull
model, characterized by the presence of stochastic noise; (iii) a theory where
response fluctuations are described by quantum mechanics and based on the
general framework of dynamical models (i) explaining the noise met in (ii) and
giving characteristic predictions. We ran an unusually long experiment with 32
rats over 3960 trials, where we excluded habituation and other well-known
phenomena as sources of variability in the subjects' performance. The best
nonlinear regression to averaged data and 60% of individual data is Hull's
model, while for the remaining 40% of the subjects the dynamical model (i)
provides a better fit. The noise encountered in all individual responses is
white, thus confirming the simplest version of model (ii) but standing in
contrast with the colored-noise findings in human performance. Finally, data
are compatible with theory (iii), although experimental uncertainties dominate
the result. On the other hand, data do not favor models with a long-memory
effect or where response variability is solely described by a random fractal.

<p>Synchronization plays a fundamental role in healthy cognitive and motor
function. However, how synchronization depends on the interplay between local
dynamics, coupling and topology and how prone to synchronization a network with
given topological organization is are still poorly understood issues. To
investigate the synchronizability of both anatomical and functional brain
networks various studies resorted to the Master Stability Function (MSF)
formalism, an elegant tool which allows analysing the stability of synchronous
states in a dynamical system consisting of many coupled oscillators. Here, we
argue that brain dynamics does not fulfil the formal criteria under which
synchronizability is usually quantified and, perhaps more importantly, what
this measure itself quantifies refers to a global dynamical condition that
never holds in the brain (not even in the most pathological conditions), and
therefore no neurophysiological conclusions should be drawn based on it. We
discuss the meaning of synchronizability and its applicability to neuroscience
and propose alternative ways to quantify brain networks synchronization.

<p>The development of spiking neural network simulation software is a critical
component enabling the modeling of neural systems and the development of
biologically inspired algorithms. Existing software frameworks support a wide
range of neural functionality, software abstraction levels, and hardware
devices, yet are typically not suitable for rapid prototyping or application to
problems in the domain of machine learning. In this paper, we describe a new
Python package for the simulation of spiking neural networks, specifically
geared towards machine learning and reinforcement learning. Our software,
called BindsNET, enables rapid building and simulation of spiking networks and
features user-friendly, concise syntax. BindsNET is built on top of the PyTorch
deep neural networks library, enabling fast CPU and GPU computation for large
spiking networks. The BindsNET framework can be adjusted to meet the needs of
other existing computing and hardware environments, e.g., TensorFlow. We also
provide an interface into the OpenAI gym library, allowing for training and
evaluation of spiking networks on reinforcement learning problems. We argue
that this package facilitates the use of spiking networks for large-scale
machine learning experimentation, and show some simple examples of how we
envision BindsNET can be used in practice. BindsNET code is available at

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning to associate stressful events with specific environmental contexts depends on excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, but how this information is transmitted to the neocortex for lasting memory storage is unclear. We identified dorsal hippocampal (DH) projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), which arise mainly from the subiculum and contain either the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) or vGlut2. Both vGlut1<sup>+</sup> and vGlut2<sup>+</sup> axons strongly excite and disynaptically inhibit RSC pyramidal neurons in superficial layers, but vGlut2<sup>+</sup> axons trigger greater inhibition that spreads to deep layers, indicating that these pathways engage RSC circuits via partially redundant, partially differentiated cellular mechanisms. Using contextual fear conditioning in mice to model contextual associative memories, together with chemogenetic axonal silencing, we found that vGlut1<sup>+</sup> projections are principally involved in processing recent context memories whereas vGlut2<sup>+</sup> projections contribute to their long-lasting storage. Thus, within the DH→RSC pathway, engagement of vGlut1<sup>+</sup> and vGlut2<sup>+</sup> circuits differentially contribute to the formation and persistence of fear-inducing context memories.</span>

Whereas accumulating evidence indicates that specification of subclasses of neocortical neurons starts at the time of their final mitotic divisions, when cellular diversity is specified in the Dentate Gyrus remains largely unknown. Here we show that semilunar cells, like mossy cells, originate from the earliest stages of developmental neurogenesis and that early born neurons form age-matched circuits with each other. Besides morphology, adult semilunar cells display characteristic electrophysiological features that differ from most neurons but are shared among early born granule cells. Therefore, an early birthdate specifies adult granule cell physiology and connectivity whereas additional factors may combine to produce morphological identity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>An influential account of reading holds that words with exceptional spelling-to-sound correspondences (e.g., PINT) are read via activation of their lexical-semantic representations, supported by the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). This account has been inconclusive because it is based on neuropsychological evidence, in which lesion-deficit relationships are difficult to localize precisely, and functional neuroimaging data, which is spatially precise but cannot demonstrate whether the ATL activity is necessary for exception word reading. To address these issues, we used a technique with good spatial specificity—repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)—to demonstrate a necessary role of ATL in exception word reading. Following rTMS to left ventral ATL, healthy Japanese adults made more regularization errors in reading Japanese exception words. We successfully simulated these results in a computational model in which exception word reading was underpinned by semantic activations. The ATL is critically and selectively involved in reading exception words.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the opportunity to delineate individual-specific brain networks. A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 min) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by 2 state-of-the-art methods using 5 sessions (50 min). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality, and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity <span style="font-style: italic;">strength</span>, individual-specific network <span style="font-style: italic;">topography</span> might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hallmark pathology underlying Parkinson disease (PD) is progressive synucleinopathy, beginning in caudal brainstem that later spreads rostrally. However, the primarily subcortical pathology fails to account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in PD. To reconcile these observations, resting-state functional dysfunction across connectivity (FC) can be used to examine dysfunction across distributed brain networks. We measured FC in a large, single-site study of nondemented PD (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 107; OFF medications) and healthy controls (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 46) incorporating rigorous quality control measures and comprehensive sampling of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions. We employed novel statistical approaches to determine group differences across the entire connectome, at the network-level, and for select brain regions. Group differences respected well-characterized network delineations producing a striking “block-wise” pattern of network-to-network effects. Surprisingly, these results demonstrate that the greatest FC differences involve sensorimotor, thalamic, and cerebellar networks, with notably smaller striatal effects. Split-half replication demonstrates the robustness of these results. Finally, block-wise FC correlations with behavior suggest that FC disruptions may contribute to clinical manifestations in PD. Overall, these results indicate a concerted breakdown of functional network interactions, remote from primary pathophysiology, and suggest that FC deficits in PD are related to emergent network-level phenomena rather than focal pathology.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Modifications of neuronal migration during development, including processes that control cortical lamination are associated with functional deficits at adult stage. Here, we report for the first time that the lack of the serine protease tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA), previously characterized as a neuromodulator and a gliotransmitter, leads to an altered cortical lamination in adult. This results in a neuronal migration defect of tPA deficient neurons which are stopped in the intermediate zone at E16. This phenotype is rescued by re-expressing a wild-type tPA in cortical neurons at E14 but not by a tPA that cannot interact with NMDAR. We thus hypothetized that the tPA produced by cortical neuronal progenitors can control their own radial migration through a mechanism dependent of NMDAR expressed at the surface of radial glial cells (RGC). Accordingly, conditional deletion of tPA in neuronal progenitors at E14 or overexpression of a dominant-negative NMDAR that cannot bind tPA in RGC also delayed neuronal migration. Moreover, the lack of tPA lead to an impaired maturation and orientation of RGC. These data provide the first demonstration that the neuronal serine protease tPA is an actor of a proper corticogenesis by its ability to control NMDAR signaling in RGC.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent studies of semantic memory have focused on dissociating the neural bases of two foundational components of human thought: taxonomic categories, which group similar objects like dogs and seals based on features, and thematic categories, which group dissimilar objects like dogs and leashes based on events. While there is emerging consensus that taxonomic concepts are represented in the anterior temporal lobe, there is disagreement over whether thematic concepts are represented in the angular gyrus (AG). We previously found AG sensitivity to both kinds of concepts; however, some accounts suggest that such activity reflects inhibition of irrelevant information rather than thematic activation. To test these possibilities, an fMRI experiment investigated both types of conceptual relations in the AG during two semantic judgment tasks. Each task trained participants to give negative responses (inhibition) or positive responses (activation) to word pairs based on taxonomic and thematic criteria of relatedness. Results showed AG engagement during both negative judgments and thematic judgments, but not during positive judgments about taxonomic pairs. Together, the results suggest that activity in the AG reflects functions that include both thematic (but not taxonomic) processing and inhibiting irrelevant semantic information.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>One critical feature of any well-engineered system is its resilience to perturbation and minor damage. The purpose of the current study was to investigate how resilience is achieved in higher cognitive systems, which we explored through the domain of semantic cognition. Convergent evidence implicates the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) as a conceptual knowledge hub. While bilateral damage to this region produces profound semantic impairment, unilateral atrophy/resection or transient perturbation has a limited effect. Two neural mechanisms might underpin this resilience to unilateral ATL damage: 1) the undamaged ATL upregulates its activation in order to compensate; and/or 2) prefrontal regions involved in control of semantic retrieval upregulate to compensate for the impoverished semantic representations that follow from ATL damage. To test these possibilities, 34 postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 20 age-matched controls were scanned whilst completing semantic tasks. Pictorial tasks, which produced bilateral frontal and temporal activation, showed few activation differences between patients and control participants. Written word tasks, however, produced a left-lateralized activation pattern and greater differences between the groups. Patients with right ATL resection increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Patients with left ATL resection upregulated both the right ATL and right IFG. Consistent with recent computational models, these results indicate that 1) written word semantic processing in patients with ATL resection is supported by upregulation of semantic knowledge and control regions, principally in the undamaged hemisphere, and 2) pictorial semantic processing is less affected, presumably because it draws on a more bilateral network.</span>

Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications, are involved in multiple aspects of neuronal function and development. Recent discoveries have shed light on critical functions of chromatin in the aging brain, with an emerging realization that the maintenance of a healthy brain relies heavily on epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we present recent advances, with a focus on histone modifications and the implications for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has been found to have rapid and long-lasting antidepressive effects. Two elegant studies from Hailan Hu’s laboratory (Cui et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) showed that ketamine blocks burst firing of neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), rapidly relieving symptoms of depression.

Many neuroscientists are excited regarding the potential of ultrasound to yield spatiotemporally precise and noninvasive modulation of arbitrary brain regions. Here, Guo et al. (2018) and Sato et al. (2018) show that applying ultrasound to rodent brains activates acoustic responses more prominently than eliciting neuromodulation directly, suggesting potential confounds of ultrasound neuromodulation experiments.

The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm foraging task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level 'state-action' prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error - reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release - to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC's crucial role in translating prediction errors into an optimal mediation between plasticity and stability.

Estimating causal connectivity between spiking neurons from measured spike sequences is one of the main challenges of systems neuroscience. In this paper we introduce two nonparametric Bayesian methods for spike-membrane and spike-spike causal connectivity based on Gaussian process regression. For spike-spike connectivity, we derive a new semi-analytic variational approximation of the response functions of a non-linear dynamical model of interconnected neurons. This semi-analytic method exploits the tractability of GP regression when the membrane potential is observed. The resulting posterior is then marginalized analytically in order to obtain the posterior of the response functions given the spike sequences alone. We validate our methods on both simulated data and real neuronal recordings.

Neural oscillations play a crucial role in communication between remote brain areas. Transcranial electric stimulation with alternating currents (TACS) can manipulate these brain oscillations in a non-invasive manner. Of particular interest, TACS protocols using multiple electrodes with phase shifted stimulation currents were developed to alter the connectivity between two or more brain regions. Typically, an increase in coordination between two sites is assumed when they experience an in-phase stimulation and a disorganization through an anti-phase stimulation. However, the underlying biophysics of multi-electrode TACS has not been studied in detail, thus limiting our ability to develop a mechanistic understanding. Here, we leverage direct invasive recordings from two non-human primates during multi-electrode TACS to show that the electric field magnitude and phase depend on the phase of the stimulation currents in a non-linear manner. Further, we report a novel phenomenon of a traveling wave stimulation where the location of the electric field maximum changes over the stimulation cycle. Our results provide a basis for a mechanistic understanding of multi-electrode TACS, necessitating the reevaluation of previously published studies, and enable future developments of novel stimulation protocols.

Given that these subjects did not have retinotopy scans performed, the visual areas were defined using an anatomical template from Benson et al. (2014). Visual areas from each hemisphere were further divided along dorsal-ventral lines into quadrants, resulting in 4 quadrants per subject. Within each quadrant, fine scaled ROIs were defined by subdividing each visual area into 5 regions according to eccentricity. These data may be useful for studying retinotopically organized functional connectivity in the visual cortex using the HCP 3 Tesla dataset.

Neuroplasticity following sensory deprivation has long inspired neuroscience research in the quest of understanding how sensory experience and genetics interact in developing the brain functional and structural architecture. Many studies have shown that sensory deprivation can lead to cross-modal functional recruitment of sensory deprived cortices. Little is known however about how structural reorganization may support these functional changes. In this study, we examined early deaf, hearing signer and hearing non-signer individuals using diffusion MRI to evaluate the potential structural connectivity linked to the functional recruitment of the temporal voice area by face stimuli in deaf individuals. More specifically, we characterized the structural connectivity between occipital, fusiform and temporal regions typically supporting voice- and face-selective processing. Despite the extensive functional reorganization for face processing in the temporal cortex of the deaf, macroscopic properties of these connections did not differ across groups. However, both occipito- and fusiform-temporal connections showed significant microstructural changes between groups (fractional anisotropy reduction, radial diffusivity increase). We propose that the reorganization of temporal regions after early auditory deprivation builds on intrinsic and mainly preserved anatomical connectivity between functionally specific temporal and occipital regions.

One unsolved question in material perception is how visual appearance interacts with haptic information. We present a pick-and-drop task using force-feedback device and a game engine to measure the effects of material appearance on the perception of mass of virtual objects. We discover that the perceived mass is mainly determined by the ground-truth mass output by the force-feedback device. Different from the classic material weight illusion (MWI), however, heavy-looking objects (e.g. steel) are consistently rated heavier than light-looking ones (e.g. fabric) with the same ground- truth mass. Analysis of the initial accelerated velocity of the movement trajectories of the virtual probe shows greater acceleration for materials with heavier rated mass. This effect is diminished when the participants lift the object for the second time, meaning that the influence of visual appearance disappears in the movement trajectories once it is calibrated by the force-feedback. We also show how the material categories are affected by both the visual appearance and the weight of the object. We conclude that visual appearance has a significant interaction with haptic force-feedback on the perception of mass and also affects the kinematics of how participants manipulate the object.

<p>by Christian Klos, Daniel Miner, Jochen Triesch</p>

Recent experiments have demonstrated that visual cortex engages in spatio-temporal sequence learning and prediction. The cellular basis of this learning remains unclear, however. Here we present a spiking neural network model that explains a recent study on sequence learning in the primary visual cortex of rats. The model posits that the sequence learning and prediction abilities of cortical circuits result from the interaction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. It also reproduces changes in stimulus-evoked multi-unit activity during learning. Furthermore, it makes precise predictions regarding how training shapes network connectivity to establish its prediction ability. Finally, it predicts that the adapted connectivity gives rise to systematic changes in spontaneous network activity. Taken together, our model establishes a new conceptual bridge between the structure and function of cortical circuits in the context of sequence learning and prediction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOLtDY7_1Wk" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at the onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature [the extracellular AP (EAP)] generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. The soma–dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potentials recorded in the brain.</p>

Abstract<p>Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder in which one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene is missing or mutated, leading to a global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism. Multiple intragenic promoters and alternatively spliced exons are responsible for the formation of numerous isoforms. Many genetically-modified mouse models of PMS have been generated but most disrupt only some of the isoforms. In contrast, the vast majority of known <i>SHANK3</i> mutations found in patients involve deletions that disrupt all isoforms. Here, we report the production and thorough behavioral characterization of a new mouse model in which all <i>Shank3</i> isoforms are disrupted. Domains and tasks examined in adults included measures of general health, neurological reflexes, motor abilities, sensory reactivity, social behavior, repetitive behaviors, cognition and behavioral inflexibility and anxiety. Our mice are more severely affected than previously published models. While the deficits were typically more pronounced in homozygotes, an intermediate phenotype was observed for heterozygotes in many paradigms. As in other <i>Shank3</i> mouse models, stereotypies, including increased grooming, were observed. Additionally, sensory alterations were detected in both neonatal and adult mice and motor behavior was strongly altered, especially in the open field and rotarod locomotor tests. While social behaviors measured with the 3-chambered social approach and male-female interaction tests were not strongly impacted, Shank3-deficient mice displayed a strong escape behavior and avoidance of inanimate objects in novel object recognition, repetitive novel object contact, marble burying and nest building tasks, indicating increased novelty-induced anxiety. Similarly, increased freezing was observed during fear conditioning training and amygdala-dependent cued retrieval. Finally, deficits were observed in both initial training and reversal in the Barnes maze and in contextual fear memory that are memory tasks involving hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. In contrast, working memory in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation test was not altered. This new mouse model of PMS, engineered to most closely represent human mutations, recapitulates core symptoms of PMS providing improvements for both construct and face validity, compared to previous models.</p><p><b>Significant Statement</b> Phelan-McDermid syndrome, caused by happloinsufficiency of <i>Shank3</i>, is a severe and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This study investigates the behavioral consequences of a disruption of all <i>Shank3</i> isoforms in neonatal and adult mice using a detailed battery o<i>f</i> tests tailored to investigate core symptoms and usual comorbidities of PMS. We found that our new model is more severely affected than previously published mouse models with only partial deletions of <i>Shank3</i> and more closely recapitulates symptoms of PMS thus providing improvements for both construct and face validity. Our results highlight the significance of using a mouse model with a complete deletion of <i>Shank3</i> for studying mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder and PMS, carrying preclinical studies and testing test novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>The stability of a complex system generally decreases with increasing system
size, as is demonstrated by random matrix theory. This counter-intuitive
result, first shown by May, is broadly relevant for understanding the dynamics
and persistence of systems such as ecological, neurological, biochemical, and
socio-economic networks. Much attention has especially been given to the
stability of ecological communities such as food webs or mutualist networks,
with recent work investigating how different community structures affect
stability. But more broadly, stabilising mechanisms in complex systems remain
under-developed, and the effect of variation in the response rate of individual
system components remains an open problem. Here I show that when components of
a complex system respond to system dynamics at different rates ($\gamma$), the
potential for system stability is markedly increased. Stability is caused by
the clustering of some eigenvalues toward the centre of eigenvalue
distributions despite the destabilising effect of higher interaction strength
variation ($\sigma^{2}$). This effect of variation in $\gamma$ becomes
increasingly important as system size increases, to the extent that the largest
stable complex systems would otherwise be unstable if not for $Var(\gamma)$. My
results therefore reveal a previously unconsidered driver of system stability
that is likely to be pervasive across all complex systems. Future research in
complex systems should therefore account for the varying response rates of
individual system components when assessing whole system stability.

<p>Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) respond when an animal
occupies a periodic lattice of "grid fields" in the environment. The grids are
organized in modules with spatial periods clustered around discrete values
separated by constant ratios reported in the range 1.3-1.8. We propose a
mechanism for dynamical self-organization in the mEC that can produce this
modular structure. In attractor network models of grid formation, the period of
a single module is set by the length scale of recurrent inhibition between
neurons. We show that grid cells will instead form a hierarchy of discrete
modules if a continuous increase in inhibition distance along the dorso-ventral
axis of the mEC is accompanied by excitatory interactions along this axis.
Moreover, constant scale ratios between successive modules arise through
geometric relationships between triangular grids, whose lattice constants are
separated by $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.7$, $\sqrt{7}/2 \approx 1.3$, or other ratios.
We discuss how the interactions required by our model might be tested
experimentally and realized by circuits in the mEC.

<p>Whole brain segmentation on a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential in non-invasive investigation for neuroanatomy. Historically,
multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded as the de facto standard
method for whole brain segmentation. Recently, deep neural network approaches
have been applied to whole brain segmentation by learning random patches or 2D
slices. Yet, few previous efforts have been made on detailed whole brain
segmentation using 3D networks due to the following challenges: (1) fitting
entire whole brain volume into 3D networks is restricted by the current GPU
memory, and (2) the large number of targeting labels (e.g., &gt; 100 labels) with
limited number of training 3D volumes (e.g., &lt; 50 scans). In this paper, we
propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to
distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks to cover
overlapped sub-spaces in a standard atlas space. This strategy simplifies the
whole brain learning task to localized sub-tasks, which was enabled by combing
canonical registration and label fusion techniques with deep learning. To
address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled
scans were created by MAS for pre-training. From empirical validation, the
state-of-the-art MAS method achieved mean Dice value of 0.76, 0.71, and 0.68,
while the proposed method achieved 0.78, 0.73, and 0.71 on three validation
cohorts. Moreover, the computational time reduced from &gt; 30 hours using MAS to
~15 minutes using the proposed method. The source code is available online

<p>by Philipp Schustek, Rubén Moreno-Bote</p>

While previous studies have shown that human behavior adjusts in response to uncertainty, it is still not well understood how uncertainty is estimated and represented. As probability distributions are high dimensional objects, only constrained families of distributions with a low number of parameters can be specified from finite data. However, it is unknown what the structural assumptions are that the brain uses to estimate them. We introduce a novel paradigm that requires human participants of either sex to explicitly estimate the dispersion of a distribution over future observations. Judgments are based on a very small sample from a centered, normally distributed random variable that was suggested by the framing of the task. This probability density estimation task could optimally be solved by inferring the dispersion parameter of a normal distribution. We find that although behavior closely tracks uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis and resists an explanation with simple heuristics, it is hardly consistent with parametric inference of a normal distribution. Despite the transparency of the simple generating process, participants estimate a distribution biased towards the observed instances while still strongly generalizing beyond the sample. The inferred internal distributions can be well approximated by a nonparametric mixture of spatially extended basis distributions. Thus, our results suggest that fluctuations have an excessive effect on human uncertainty judgments because of representations that can adapt overly flexibly to the sample. This might be of greater utility in more general conditions in structurally uncertain environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o3YR8jyibrQ" width="1" />

Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukuSUmhrVc" width="1" />

<p>by Xiaoru Xue, Chuan Xue, Min Tang</p>

Recent experiments showed that engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i> colonies grow and self-organize into periodic stripes with high and low cell densities in semi-solid agar. The stripes develop sequentially behind a radially propagating colony front, similar to the formation of many other periodic patterns in nature. These bacteria were created by genetically coupling the intracellular chemotaxis pathway of wild-type cells with a quorum sensing module through the protein CheZ. In this paper, we develop multiscale models to investigate how this intracellular pathway affects stripe formation. We first develop a detailed hybrid model that treats each cell as an individual particle and incorporates intracellular signaling via an internal ODE system. To overcome the computational cost of the hybrid model caused by the large number of cells involved, we next derive a mean-field PDE model from the hybrid model using asymptotic analysis. We show that this analysis is justified by the tight agreement between the PDE model and the hybrid model in 1D simulations. Numerical simulations of the PDE model in 2D with radial symmetry agree with experimental data semi-quantitatively. Finally, we use the PDE model to make a number of testable predictions on how the stripe patterns depend on cell-level parameters, including cell speed, cell doubling time and the turnover rate of intracellular CheZ.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s7yiJrNeGjk" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer collateral synapses. Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin and CaMKII. Here, we investigated whether RGS14 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We found that the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses caused by genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report that RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.</p>

Abstract
<p>Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-mo-old) F344xBN rats generally do not show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8 d, but generally less than 14 d, after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-mo-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 h. We previously demonstrated that theta burst–evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP)—a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity—is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 d after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)—the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP—are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.</p>

Abstract<p>Evolutionary pressures suggest that choices should be optimised to maximise rewards, by appropriately trading speed for accuracy. This speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is commonly explained by variation in just the baseline-to-boundary distance, i.e. excursion, of accumulation-to-bound models of perceptual decision making. However, neural evidence is not consistent with this explanation. A compelling account of speeded choice should explain both overt behaviour and the full range of associated brain signatures. Here, we reconcile seemingly contradictory behavioural and neural findings. In two variants of the same experiment, we triangulated upon the neural underpinnings of the SAT in the human brain using both EEG and TMS. We found that distinct neural signals, namely the ERP centroparietal positivity (CPP) and a smoothed motor-evoked potential (MEP) signal, which have both previously been shown to relate to decision-related accumulation, revealed qualitatively similar average neurodynamic profiles with only subtle differences between SAT conditions. These signals were then modelled from behaviour by either incorporating traditional boundary variation or utilising a forced excursion. These model variants are mathematically equivalent, in terms of their behavioural predictions, hence providing identical fits to correct and erroneous reaction time distributions. However, the forced-excursion version instantiates SAT via a more global change in parameters and implied neural activity, a process conceptually akin to, but mathematically distinct from, urgency. This variant better captured both ERP and MEP neural profiles, suggesting that the SAT may be implemented via neural gain modulation, and reconciling standard modelling approaches with human neural data.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Successful organisms need to make the right choice fast. To make such decisions, we are regularly forced to trade speed for accuracy. This trade-off has been explained in behavioural models using a single free parameter reflecting response caution. However, neural evidence suggests that more widespread changes are associated with quick versus accurate decisions. Here, we suggest a model which reconciles these seemingly contradictory findings. This ‘forced-excursion’ model is mathematically equivalent to standard models of response caution but implies a global modulation in activity akin to a change in neural gain or urgency. Re-expressed in this way, the model is able to account for both behavioural and neural data from two separate neural recording techniques.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0125-18.2018v1?rss=1">Ethanol Regulates Presynaptic Activity and Sedation through Presynaptic Unc13 Proteins in Drosophila</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it isn't yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology <i>in vivo</i>. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol binding. The inhibition of diacylglycerol binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In <i>Drosophila</i>, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons, while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. <i>Drosophila,</i> haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog <i>Dunc13</i>, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of <i>Dunc13</i> through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of <i>Munc13-1</i> in heterozygotes for a <i>Dunc13</i> loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between <i>Munc13-1</i> and <i>Dunc13</i> in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> At relatively low concentrations, ethanol inhibits the activity of many presynaptic termini (Liu and Hunt, 1999). Homeostatic changes in presynaptic activity are proposed to underlie the formation of functional tolerance (Koob and Bloom, 1988; Ghezzi and Atkinson, 2011). We do not currently know where ethanol binds to bring about changes in presynaptic activity and homeostasis. We now show that ethanol will bind to the C1 domain of the Munc13-1 protein at intoxicating concentrations and inhibit the binding of diacylglycerol. Reducing the activity of the <i>Drosophila</i> Dunc13 ortholog leads to a homeostatic change that promotes behavioral and physiologic resistance to intoxicating levels of ethanol. Hence, Unc13 proteins are likely sites for ethanol’s action within the presynaptic compartment that bring about tolerance.</p>

<p>The study of brain networks, including derived from functional neuroimaging
data, attracts broad interest and represents a rapidly growing
interdisciplinary field. Comparing networks of healthy volunteers with those of
patients can potentially offer new, quantitative diagnostic methods, and a
framework for better understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting
state fMRI data through network measures, and demonstrate that not only is
there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy brain that is disrupted
in schizophrenia, but also that both networks respond to medication. We
construct networks representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia
patients (males and females), all of whom are administered three drug
treatments: (i) a placebo; and two antipsychotic medications (ii) aripiprazole
and; (iii) sulpiride. We first reproduce the established finding that brain
networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced
clustering compared to controls. Our data then reveals that the antipsychotic
medications mitigate this effect, shifting the metrics towards those observed
in healthy volunteers, with a marked difference in efficacy between the two
drugs. Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network
statistics of healthy controls. Using a test of cognitive ability, we establish
that aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This provides
evidence that changes to macroscopic brain network architecture result in
measurable behavioural differences. This is the first time different
medications have been assessed in this way. Our results lay the groundwork for
an objective methodology with which to calculate and compare the efficacy of
different treatments of mind and brain disorders.

<p>Visual segmentation is a key perceptual function that partitions visual space
and allows for detection, recognition and discrimination of objects in complex
environments. The processes underlying human segmentation of natural images are
still poorly understood. Existing datasets rely on manual labeling that
conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. In part, this is because we
lack an ideal observer model of segmentation to guide constrained experiments.
On the other hand, despite recent progress in machine learning, modern
algorithms still fall short of human segmentation performance. Our goal here is
two-fold (i) propose a model to probe human visual segmentation mechanisms and
(ii) develop an efficient algorithm for image segmentation. To this aim, we
propose a novel probabilistic generative model of visual segmentation that for
the first time combines 1) knowledge about the sensitivity of neurons in the
visual cortex to statistical regularities in natural images; and 2)
non-parametric Bayesian priors over segmentation maps (ie partitions of the
visual space). We provide an algorithm for learning and inference, validate it
on synthetic data, and illustrate how the two components of our model improve
segmentation of natural images. We then show that the posterior distribution
over segmentations captures well the variability across human subjects,
indicating that our model provides a viable approach to probe human visual
segmentation.

<p>Schizophrenia, a mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal social
behavior and failure to distinguish one's own thoughts and ideas from reality,
has been associated with structural abnormalities in the architecture of
functional brain networks. Using various methods from network analysis, we
examine the effect of two classical therapeutic antipsychotics --- Aripiprazole
and Sulpiride --- on the structure of functional brain networks of healthy
controls and patients who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. We compare
the community structures of functional brain networks of different individuals
using mesoscopic response functions, which measure how community structure
changes across different scales of a network. We are able to do a reasonably
good job of distinguishing patients from controls, and we are most successful
at this task on people who have been treated with Aripiprazole. We demonstrate
that this increased separation between patients and controls is related only to
a change in the control group, as the functional brain networks of the patient
group appear to be predominantly unaffected by this drug. This suggests that
Aripiprazole has a significant and measurable effect on community structure in
healthy individuals but not in individuals who are diagnosed with
schizophrenia. In contrast, we find for individuals are given the drug
Sulpiride that it is more difficult to separate the networks of patients from
those of controls. Overall, we observe differences in the effects of the drugs
(and a placebo) on community structure in patients and controls and also that
this effect differs across groups. We thereby demonstrate that different types
of antipsychotic drugs selectively affect mesoscale structures of brain
networks, providing support that mesoscale structures such as communities are
meaningful functional units in the brain.

As in all biological systems, neurons and their networks must balance precision with variability. Phenotypic precision and phenotypic variability can both occur with remarkable robustness, where robustness is defined as the ability to tolerate perturbation. Variability in genotype–phenotype mapping produces phenotypic variability despite identical genetic information. The resulting variability among genetically identical neurons can contribute to the robustness of brain development. Similarly, variability of genetically identical individuals can contribute to evolutionary robustness.

<p>Humans are adept at uncovering complex associations in the world around them,
yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Intuitively, learning
the higher-order structure of statistical relationships should involve
sophisticated mental processes, expending valuable computational resources.
Here we propose a competing perspective: that higher-order associations
actually arise from natural errors in learning. Combining ideas from
information theory and reinforcement learning, we derive a novel maximum
entropy model of people's internal expectations about the transition structures
underlying sequences of ordered events. Importantly, our model analytically
accounts for previously unexplained network effects on human expectations and
quantitatively describes human reaction times in probabilistic sequential motor
tasks. Additionally, our model asserts that human expectations should depend
critically on the different topological scales in a transition network, a
prediction that we subsequently test and validate in a novel experiment.
Generally, our results highlight the important role of mental errors in shaping
abstract representations, and directly inspire new physically-motivated models
of human behavior.

In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.

By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.

Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.

In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.

<p>by Anton V. Chizhov, Artyom V. Zefirov, Dmitry V. Amakhin, Elena Yu. Smirnova, Aleksey V. Zaitsev</p>

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Dopamine plays a key role in the cellular and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, but the implication of metabotropic regulatory input to dopaminergic neurons on acute drug effects and subsequent drug-related behavior remains unclear. Here, we used chemogenetics (DREADD; Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to modulate dopamine signaling and activity prior to cocaine administration in mice. We show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons differentially affects locomotor and reward-related behavioral responses to cocaine. Stimulation of Gi-coupled DREADD (hM4Di) expressed in dopaminergic VTA neurons persistently reduced the locomotor response to repeated cocaine injections. An attenuated locomotor response was even seen when a dual-viral vector approach was used to restrict hM4Di-expression to dopaminergic VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. Surprisingly, despite the attenuated locomotor response, hM4Di-mediated inhibition of dopaminergic VTA neurons did not prevent cocaine sensitization, and the inhibitory effect of hM4Di-mediated inhibition was eliminated after withdrawal. In the conditioned place preference paradigm, hM4Di-mediated inhibition did not affect cocaine-induced place preference; however, the extinction period was extended. Also, hM4Di-mediated inhibition had no effect on preference for a sugar-based reward over water but impaired motivation to work for the same reward in a touchscreen-based motivational assay. In addition to support that VTA dopaminergic neurons operate as regulators of reward motivation towards both sugar and cocaine, our data suggest that repeated cocaine exposure leads to adaptations in the VTA that surmount the ability of Gi-signaling to suppress and regulate VTA dopaminergic neuronal activity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The addictive properties of cocaine and other drugs of abuse are tightly coupled to altered dopamine (DA) neurotransmission mediated by dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we used DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to investigate how modulation of these neurons via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) affects the behavioral effects of cocaine. The data substantiate dopaminergic VTA neurons as a prime regulator of explorative locomotion and reward motivation as well as they reveal a delicate role of metabotropic Gi-coupled input with differential effects during acute, repeated and sensitized responses to cocaine. The results may provide an important framework for exploring new principles for addiction treatment via modulation of GPCR signaling within the dopaminergic system.</p>

<p>Estimated connectomes by the means of neuroimaging techniques have enriched
our knowledge of the organizational properties of the brain leading to the
development of network-based clinical diagnostics. Unfortunately, to date, many
of those network-based clinical diagnostics tools, based on the mere
description of isolated instances of observed connectomes are noisy estimates
of the true connectivity network. Modeling brain connectivity networks is
therefore important to better explain the functional organization of the brain
and allow inference of specific brain properties. In this report, we present
pilot results on the modeling of combined MEG and fMRI neuroimaging data
acquired during an n-back memory task experiment. We adopted a pooled
Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) as a network statistical model to capture
the underlying process in functional brain networks of 9 subjects MEG and fMRI
data out of 32 during a 0-back vs 2-back memory task experiment. Our results
suggested strong evidence that all the functional connectomes of the 9 subjects
have small world properties. A group level comparison using comparing the
conditions pairwise showed no significant difference in the functional
connectomes across the subjects. Our pooled ERGMs successfully reproduced
important brain properties such as functional segregation and functional
integration. However, the ERGMs reproducing the functional segregation of the
brain networks discriminated between the 0-back and 2-back conditions while the
models reproducing both properties failed to successfully discriminate between
both conditions. Our results are promising and would improve in robustness with
a larger sample size. Nevertheless, our pilot results tend to support previous
findings that functional segregation and integration are sufficient to
statistically reproduce the main properties of brain network.

<p>The idea that the brain functions in a way that minimizes certain costs
pervades theoretical neuroscience. Since a cost function by itself does not
predict how the brain finds its minima, additional assumptions about the
optimization method are usually made in order to obtain predictions about
physiological quantities. In this context, steepest ascent or descent is often
suggested as a biologically implemented optimization algorithm. However, the
notion of a steepest direction depends on the choice of a Riemannian metric.
Since this choice involves infinite degrees of freedom, the predictive power of
models that are based on this principle can be called into question. Despite
its great success in machine learning, especially in training deep neural
networks, arguments about brain function that rely on gradient-based
optimization have to be closely examined.

<p>Cerebral autoregulation refers to the brain's ability to maintain cerebral
blood flow at an approximately constant level, despite changes in arterial
blood pressure. The performance of this mechanism is often assessed using a
ten-scale index called the ARI (autoregulation index). Here, $0$ denotes the
absence of, while $9$ denotes the strongest, autoregulation. Current methods to
calculate the ARI do not typically provide error estimates. Here, we show how
this can be done using a bayesian approach. We use Markov-chain Monte Carlo
methods to produce a probability distribution for the ARI, which gives a
natural way to estimate error.

<p>To guide behavior, sensory systems detect the onset and offset of stimuli and process these distinct inputs via parallel pathways. In the retina, this strategy is implemented by splitting neural signals for light onset and offset via synapses connecting photoreceptors to ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. It remains poorly understood which molecular cues establish the architecture of this synaptic configuration to split light-onset and light-offset signals. A mutant with reduced synapses between photoreceptors and one bipolar cell type, but not the other, could reveal a critical cue. From this approach, we report a novel synaptic role for <i>pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa</i> (<i>pappaa</i>) in promoting the structure and function of cone synapses that transmit light-offset information. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses indicated <i>pappaa</i> mutant zebrafish have dysfunctional cone-to-OFF bipolar cell synapses and impaired responses to light offset, but intact cone-to-ON bipolar cell synapses and light-onset responses. Ultrastructural analyses of <i>pappaa</i> mutant cones showed a lack of presynaptic domains at synapses with OFF bipolar cells. <i>pappaa</i> is expressed postsynaptically to the cones during retinal synaptogenesis and encodes a secreted metalloprotease known to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Induction of dominant-negative IGF1 receptor expression during synaptogenesis reduced light-offset responses. Conversely, stimulating IGF1 signaling at this time improved <i>pappaa</i> mutants' light-offset responses and cone presynaptic structures. Together, our results indicate Pappaa-regulated IGF1 signaling as a novel pathway that establishes how cone synapses convey light-offset signals to guide behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distinct sensory inputs, like stimulus onset and offset, are often split at distinct synapses into parallel circuits for processing. In the retina, photoreceptors and ON and OFF bipolar cells form discrete synapses to split neural signals coding light onset and offset, respectively. The molecular cues that establish this synaptic configuration to specifically convey light onset or offset remain unclear. Our work reveals a novel cue: <i>pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa</i> (<i>pappaa</i>), which regulates photoreceptor synaptic structure and function to specifically transmit light-offset information. Pappaa is a metalloprotease that stimulates local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. IGF1 promotes various aspects of synaptic development and function and is broadly expressed, thus requiring local regulators, like Pappaa, to govern its specificity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5209?rss=1">Conditional Bistability, a Generic Cellular Mnemonic Mechanism for Robust and Flexible Working Memory Computations</a></h4>

<p>Persistent neural activity, the substrate of working memory, is thought to emerge from synaptic reverberation within recurrent networks. However, reverberation models do not robustly explain the fundamental dynamics of persistent activity, including high-spiking irregularity, large intertrial variability, and state transitions. While cellular bistability may contribute to persistent activity, its rigidity appears incompatible with persistent activity labile characteristics. Here, we unravel in a cellular model a form of spike-mediated conditional bistability that is robust and generic. and provides a rich repertoire of mnemonic computations. Under asynchronous synaptic inputs of the awakened state, conditional bistability generates spiking/bursting episodes, accounting for the irregularity, variability, and state transitions characterizing persistent activity. This mechanism has likely been overlooked because of the subthreshold input it requires, and we predict how to assess it experimentally. Our results suggest a reexamination of the role of intrinsic properties in the collective network dynamics responsible for flexible working memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study unravels a novel form of intrinsic neuronal property: conditional bistability. We show that, thanks to its conditional character, conditional bistability favors the emergence of flexible and robust forms of persistent activity in PFC neural networks, in opposition to previously studied classical forms of absolute bistability. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that conditional bistability (1) is a generic biophysical spike-dependent mechanism of layer V pyramidal neurons in the PFC and that (2) it accounts for essential neurodynamical features for the organization and flexibility of PFC persistent activity (the large irregularity and intertrial variability of the discharge and its organization under discrete stable states), which remain unexplained in a robust fashion by current models.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5196?rss=1">Neural Mechanisms Underlying Individual Differences in Control-Averse Behavior</a></h4>

<p>When another person tries to control one's decisions, some people might comply, but many will feel the urge to act against that control. This control aversion can lead to suboptimal decisions and it affects social interactions in many societal domains. To date, however, it has been unclear what drives individual differences in control-averse behavior. Here, we address this issue by measuring brain activity with fMRI while healthy female and male human participants made choices that were either free or controlled by another person, with real consequences to both interaction partners. In addition, we assessed the participants' affects, social cognitions, and motivations via self-reports. Our results indicate that the social cognitions perceived distrust and lack of understanding for the other person play a key role in explaining control aversion at the behavioral level. At the neural level, we find that control-averse behavior can be explained by functional connectivity between the inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, brain regions commonly associated with attention reorientation and cognitive control. Further analyses reveal that the individual strength of functional connectivity complements and partially mediates the self-reported social cognitions in explaining individual differences in control-averse behavior. These findings therefore provide valuable contributions to a more comprehensive model of control aversion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Control aversion is a prevalent phenomenon in our society. When someone tries to control their decisions, many people tend to act against the control. This can lead to suboptimal decisions such as noncompliance to medical treatments or disobeying the law. The degree to which individuals engage in control-averse behavior, however, varies significantly. Understanding the proximal mechanisms that underlie individual differences in control-averse behavior has potential policy implications, for example, when designing policies aimed at increasing compliance with vaccination recommendations, and is therefore a highly relevant research goal. Here, we identify a neural mechanism between parietal and prefrontal brain regions that can explain individual differences in control-averse behavior. This mechanism provides novel insights into control aversion beyond what is accessible through self-reports.</p>

Abstract
<p>Increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) following cerebral injury results in regional extravasation of plasma proteins and can critically contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here, we comprehensively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of a main extravasation component, albumin, and illuminate associated responses of the neurovascular unit (NVU) contributing to early epileptogenic neuropathology. We applied translational <i>in vivo</i> MR imaging and complementary immunohistochemical analyses in the widely used rat pilocarpine post–status epilepticus (SE) model. The observed rapid BBB leakage affected major epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, peaked between 1 and 2 d post-SE, and rapidly declined thereafter, accompanied by cerebral edema generally following the same time course. At peak of BBB leakage, serum albumin colocalized with NVU constituents, such as vascular components, neurons, and brain immune cells. Surprisingly, astroglial markers did not colocalize with albumin, and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was clearly reduced in areas of leaky BBB, indicating a severe disturbance of astrocyte-mediated endothelial-neuronal coupling. In addition, a distinct adaptive reorganization process of the NVU vasculature apparently takes place at sites of albumin presence, substantiated by reduced immunoreactivity of endothelial and changes in vascular basement membrane markers. Taken together, degenerative events at the level of the NVU, affecting vessels, astrocytes, and neurons, seem to outweigh reconstructive processes. Considering the rapidly occurring BBB leakage and subsequent impairment of the NVU, our data support the necessity of a prompt BBB-restoring treatment as one component of rational therapeutic intervention to prevent epileptogenesis and the development of other detrimental sequelae of SE.</p>

Abstract
<p>Preconditioning nerve injuries activate a pro-regenerative program that enhances axon regeneration for most classes of sensory neurons. However, nociceptive sensory neurons and central nervous system neurons regenerate poorly. In hopes of identifying novel mechanisms that promote regeneration, we screened for drugs that mimicked the preconditioning response and identified a nociceptive ligand that activates a preconditioning-like response to promote axon outgrowth. We show that activating the ion channel TRPV1 with capsaicin induces axon outgrowth of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, and that this effect is blocked in TRPV1 knockout neurons. Regeneration occurs only in NF200-negative nociceptive neurons, consistent with a cell-autonomous mechanism. Moreover, we identify a signaling pathway in which TRPV1 activation leads to calcium influx and protein kinase A (PKA) activation to induce a preconditioning-like response. Finally, capsaicin administration to the mouse sciatic nerve activates a similar preconditioning-like response and induces enhanced axonal outgrowth, indicating that this pathway can be induced <i>in vivo</i>. These findings highlight the use of local ligands to induce regeneration and suggest that it may be possible to target selective neuronal populations for repair, including cell types that often fail to regenerate.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are engaged in various cognitive and affective processes. An influential account posits that the AI and dACC’s ubiquitous engagements reflect their role in the transient capture of attention by salient stimuli. Using fMRI here we tested this claim and functionally dissociated these regions. In the first experiment, we compared these regions’ responses to emotion-laden and emotion-neutral salient “oddball” movie events. We found that while the AI only responded transiently to the onset and offset of neutral events, its response to affective events was sustained, challenging the transient attention capture account. By contrast, dACC remained transient regardless of event type. A second experiment distinguished the information encoded by these brain regions with the presentation of behaviorally salient events that require either maintaining the current task set or updating to a different one; the AI was found to signal the presence of the behaviorally relevant events, while the dACC was associated with switching of attention settings in response to the events. We conclude that AI and dACC are involved in signaling the presence of potentially or de facto behaviorally significant events and updating internal attention settings in response to these events, respectively.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP25) is an essential component of the SNARE complex regulating synaptic vesicle fusion. SNAP25 deficiency has been implicated in a variety of cognitive disorders. We ablated SNAP25 from selected neuronal populations by generating a transgenic mouse (B6-Snap25tm3mcw (Snap25-flox)) with LoxP sites flanking exon5a/5b. In the presence of Cre-recombinase, Snap25-flox is recombined to a truncated transcript. Evoked synaptic vesicle release is severely reduced in Snap25 conditional knockout (cKO) neurons as shown by live cell imaging of synaptic vesicle fusion and whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured hippocampal neurons. We studied Snap25 cKO in subsets of cortical projection neurons in vivo (L5—Rbp4-Cre; L6—Ntsr1-Cre; L6b—Drd1a-Cre). cKO neurons develop normal axonal projections, but axons are not maintained appropriately, showing signs of swelling, fragmentation and eventually complete absence. Onset and progression of degeneration are dependent on the neuron type, with L5 cells showing the earliest and most severe axonal loss. Ultrastructural examination revealed that cKO neurites contain autophagosome/lysosome-like structures. Markers of inflammation such as Iba1 and lipofuscin are increased only in adult cKO cortex. Snap25 cKO can provide a model to study genetic interactions with environmental influences in several disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Local gyrification index (LGI), a metric quantifying cortical folding, was evaluated in 105 boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 49 typically developing (TD) boys at 3 and 5 years-of-age. At 3 years-of-age, boys with ASD had reduced gyrification in the fusiform gyrus compared with TD boys. A longitudinal evaluation from 3 to 5 years revealed that while TD boys had stable/decreasing LGI, boys with ASD had increasing LGI in right inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, and stable LGI in left lingual gyrus. LGI was also examined in a previously defined neurophenotype of boys with ASD and disproportionate megalencephaly. At 3 years-of-age, this subgroup exhibited increased LGI in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and paracentral cortex, and left cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus relative to TD boys and increased LGI in right paracentral lobule and parahippocampal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus compared with boys with ASD and normal brain size. In summary, this study identified alterations in the pattern and development of LGI during early childhood in ASD. Distinct patterns of alterations in subgroups of boys with ASD suggests that multiple neurophenotypes exist and boys with ASD and disproportionate megalencephaly should be evaluated separately.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is little understanding of the structural underpinnings of the functional reorganization of the cortex in the congenitally blind human. Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) encompasses 7 distinct cyto- and receptorarchitectonic areas. We lack a detailed understanding of the functions in which they are involved, and stereotaxic maps are not available. We present an integrated structural/functional map of pACC based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping and meta-analytic connectivity modeling and quantitative functional decoding. Due to the restricted spatial resolution of functional imaging data relative to the microstructural parcellation, areas p24a of the callosal sulcus and p24b on the surface of the cingulate gyrus were merged into a “gyral component” (p24ab) of area p24, and areas pv24c, pd24cv, and pd24cd, located within the cingulate sulcus were merged into a “sulcal component” (p24c) for meta-analytic analysis. Area p24ab was specifically associated with interoception, p24c with the inhibition of action, and p32, which was also activated by emotion induction tasks pertaining negatively valenced stimuli, with the ability to experience empathy. Thus, area p32 could be classified as cingulate association cortex playing a crucial role in the cognitive regulation of emotion. By this spectrum of functions, pACC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous region, clearly differing from other parts of the anterior and middle cingulate cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to make individual-level predictions from neuroanatomy has the potential to be particularly useful in child development. Previously, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI has been used to successfully predict maturity and diagnosis of typically and atypically developing individuals. Unfortunately, submillimeter head motion in the scanner produces systematic, distance-dependent differences in RSFC and may contaminate, and potentially facilitate, these predictions. Here, we evaluated individual age prediction with RSFC after stringent motion denoising. Using multivariate machine learning, we found that 57% of the variance in individual RSFC after motion artifact denoising was explained by age, while 4% was explained by residual effects of head motion. When RSFC data were not adequately denoised, 50% of the variance was explained by motion. Reducing motion-related artifact also revealed that prediction did not depend upon characteristics of functional connections previously hypothesized to mediate development (e.g., connection distance). Instead, successful age prediction relied upon sampling functional connections across multiple functional systems with strong, reliable RSFC within an individual. Our results demonstrate that RSFC across the brain is sufficiently robust to make individual-level predictions of maturity in typical development, and hence, may have clinical utility for the diagnosis and prognosis of individuals with atypical developmental trajectories.</span>

<p>by Eli J. Müller, Peter A. Robinson</p>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8" width="1" />

<p>by William Hedley Thompson, Craig Geoffrey Richter, Pontus Plavén-Sigray, Peter Fransson</p>

There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain’s dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present <i>tvc_benchmarker</i>, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method’s ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using <i>tvc_benchmarker</i> researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PcnqFhi9tsk" width="1" />

<p>by Marissa Renardy, Tau-Mu Yi, Dongbin Xiu, Ching-Shan Chou</p>

A common challenge in systems biology is quantifying the effects of unknown parameters and estimating parameter values from data. For many systems, this task is computationally intractable due to expensive model evaluations and large numbers of parameters. In this work, we investigate a new method for performing sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of complex biological models using techniques from uncertainty quantification. The primary advance is a significant improvement in computational efficiency from the replacement of model simulation by evaluation of a polynomial surrogate model. We demonstrate the method on two models of mating in budding yeast: a smaller ODE model of the heterotrimeric G-protein cycle, and a larger spatial model of pheromone-induced cell polarization. A small number of model simulations are used to fit the polynomial surrogates, which are then used to calculate global parameter sensitivities. The surrogate models also allow rapid Bayesian inference of the parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) by eliminating model simulations at each step. Application to the ODE model shows results consistent with published single-point estimates for the model and data, with the added benefit of calculating the correlations between pairs of parameters. On the larger PDE model, the surrogate models allowed convergence for the distribution of 15 parameters, which otherwise would have been computationally prohibitive using simulations at each MCMC step. We inferred parameter distributions that in certain cases peaked at values different from published values, and showed that a wide range of parameters would permit polarization in the model. Strikingly our results suggested different diffusion constants for active versus inactive Cdc42 to achieve good polarization, which is consistent with experimental observations in another yeast species <i>S. pombe</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRhq-0CxzAI" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AXBHSencE5U/article">Optimizing the learning rate for adaptive estimation of neural encoding models</a></h4>

<p>by Han-Lin Hsieh, Maryam M. Shanechi</p>

Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time. Moreover, the calibration algorithm allows for fast and accurate learning of the encoding model and for fast convergence of decoding to accurate performance. Finally, larger learning rates result in inaccurate encoding models and decoders, and smaller learning rates delay their convergence. The calibration algorithm provides a novel analytical approach to predictably achieve a desired level of error and convergence time in adaptive learning, with application to closed-loop neurotechnologies and other signal processing domains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXBHSencE5U" width="1" />

<p>The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.</p>

Abstract<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong genetic aetiology. Since mutations in human <i>SHANK</i> genes have been found in patients with autism, genetic mouse models are employed for a mechanistic understanding of ASDs and the development of therapeutic strategies. SHANKs are scaffold proteins in the postsynaptic density of mammalian excitatory synapses with proposed functions in synaptogenesis, regulation of dendritic spine morphology, and instruction of structural synaptic plasticity. In contrast to all studies so far on the function of SHANK proteins, we have previously observed enhanced synaptic plasticity in Shank2 ex7<sup>–/–</sup> mice. In a series of experiments we now reproduce these results, further explore the synaptic phenotype, and directly compare our model to the independently generated Shank2 ex6-7<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Minimal stimulation experiments reveal that Shank2 ex7<sup>–/–</sup> mice possess an excessive fraction of silent (i.e. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, short, AMPA receptor lacking) synapses. The synaptic maturation deficit emerges during the third postnatal week and constitutes a plausible mechanistic explanation for the mutants' increased capacity for long-term potentiation (LTP), both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. A direct comparison with Shank2 ex6-7<sup>–/–</sup> mice adds weight to the hypothesis that both models show a different set of synaptic phenotypes, possibly due to differences in their genetic background. These findings add to the diversity of synaptic phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders and further support the supposed existence of "modifier genes" in the expression and inheritance of ASDs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a global prevalence of 0.1–2%, a fraction of which is caused by mutations in human <i>SHANK</i> genes. A number of Shank mouse models that reproduce behavioral symptoms also show reduced synaptic plasticity - which is why boosting plasticity has become one line of therapeutic rescue efforts. In contrast to all studies so far on the function of SHANK proteins, we observe enhanced plasticity in Shank2 ex7<sup>–/–</sup> mice and uncover a previously unrecognized synapse maturation deficit. This neurodevelopmental phenotype is shared among a number of mouse models for neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting synapse maturation as a field of future studies and for the exploration of therapeutic intervention. The observation of distinct and non-congruent phenotypes in genetically similar yet non-identical mouse models adds weight to the hypothesis that genetic interactions of putative "modifier genes" might influence the phenotype.</p>

Abstract<p>Class I members of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolutionarily appeared just prior to the advent of neuronal like cells and have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single class I TRIM in <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>C. elegans</i> and the mammalian class I TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the guidance cue netrin, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Opitz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often intellectual disability. We find that although TRIM67 is the least studied vertebrate class I TRIM, it is the most evolutionarily conserved. Here we show that mammalian TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions during development and adulthood. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine <i>Trim67</i>. While viable, mice lacking <i>Trim67</i> exhibit abnormal anatomy of specific brain regions, including hypotrophy of the hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, and thinning of forebrain commissures. Additionally, <i>Trim67<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function, and sensorimotor gating, whereas several other behaviors remain intact. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and behavior.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Class I TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in neuronal development and function, some of which occur downstream of netrin. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved of this class and is developmentally regulated and brain-enriched. Deletion of murine <i>Trim67</i> results in malformations of a subset of subcortical brain regions and of cortical and subcortical myelinated fiber tracts, as well as deficits in spatial memory, motor function, sociability and sensorimotor gating. Interactions between TRIM67 and both the netrin receptor DCC and TRIM9, and abnormalities in netrin-sensitive brain regions are noted. We conclude that TRIM67 is critical for appropriate brain development and behavior.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Across cultures and throughout history, human beings have reported a variety of spiritual experiences and the concomitant perceived sense of union that transcends one’s ordinary sense of self. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms of spiritual experiences, particularly when examined across different traditions and practices. By adapting an individualized guided-imagery task, we investigated neural correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences as compared with stressful and neutral-relaxing experiences. We observed in the spiritual condition, as compared with the neutral-relaxing condition, reduced activity in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a result that suggests the IPL may contribute importantly to perceptual processing and self-other representations during spiritual experiences. Compared with stress cues, responses to spiritual cues showed reduced activity in the medial thalamus and caudate, regions associated with sensory and emotional processing. Overall, the study introduces a novel method for investigating brain correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences and suggests neural mechanisms associated with broadly defined and personally experienced spirituality.</span>

Abstract<p>Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex non-linear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong-Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Individualized medicine is increasingly put forward as an important means to advance medical care. In this regard, the neuroinformatics platform "The Virtual Brain" holds great promise, given its direct focus on simulation of subject-specific brain activity. Reliable prediction of patient-specific large-scale brain dynamics would open up the possibility to virtually lesion structural connectomes, making computational models unique predictive tools to investigate the impact of diverse structural connectivity alterations on brain functioning, including those purposefully induced by surgery. Results of this study establish the basis for this purpose, by demonstrating individual specificity of biophysical model parameters, differences in local model parameters dependent on distance from a tumor, and associations between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.</p>

Abstract<p>Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-month-old) F344xBN rats generally don’t show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of <i>E. coli</i> or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8, but generally less than 14 days after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-month-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 hours. We previously demonstrated that theta burst-evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) – a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity – is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 days after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) – the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP – are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Not all cognitive decline is gradual. Older individuals – even those previously healthy and high functioning – are more likely to experience an abrupt decline in mental function (termed delirium) after immune challenge. Even if this is temporary, it is associated with increased risk of ultimately developing dementia. Although clinically important, this phenomenon is much less studied than gradual senescence and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Here we use a naturalistic rodent model to further test the hypothesis that the combination of age and an immune challenge may trigger an exaggerated inflammatory state in the brain, which in turn, disrupts molecular systems critical for memory. These studies may provide mechanistic insights into the earliest stages of inflammation-driven failures of memory-related synaptic plasticity.</p>

Abstract
<p>Action and perception are tightly coupled systems requiring coordination and synchronization over time. How the brain achieves synchronization is still a matter of debate, but recent experiments suggest that brain oscillations may play an important role in this process. Brain oscillations have been also proposed to be fundamental in determining time perception. Here, we had subjects perform an audiovisual temporal order judgment task to investigate the fine dynamics of temporal bias and sensitivity before and after the execution of voluntary hand movement (button-press). The reported order of the audiovisual sequence was rhythmically biased as a function of delay from hand action execution. Importantly, we found that it oscillated at a theta range frequency, starting ~500 ms before and persisting ~250 ms after the button-press, with consistent phase-locking across participants. Our results show that the perception of cross-sensory simultaneity oscillates rhythmically in synchrony with the programming phase of a voluntary action, demonstrating a link between action preparation and bias in temporal perceptual judgments.</p>

Abstract
<p>Serotonergic innervation of sensory areas is found ubiquitously across the central nervous system of vertebrates. Here, we used a system’s level approach to investigate the role of serotonin on processing motion stimuli in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish <i>Apteronotus albifrons</i>. We found that exogenous serotonin application increased the firing activity of pyramidal neural responses to both looming and receding motion. Separating spikes belonging to bursts from those that were isolated revealed that this effect was primarily due to increased burst firing. Moreover, when investigating whether firing activity during stimulation could be discriminated from baseline (i.e., in the absence of stimulation), we found that serotonin increased stimulus discriminability only for some stimuli. This is because increased burst firing was most prominent for these. Further, the effects of serotonin were highly heterogeneous, with some neurons displaying large while others instead displaying minimal changes in responsiveness following serotonin application. Further analysis revealed that serotonin application had the greatest effect on neurons with low baseline firing rates and little to no effect on neurons with high baseline firing rates. Finally, the effects of serotonin on sensory neuron responses were largely independent of object velocity. Our results therefore reveal a novel function for the serotonergic system in selectively enhancing discriminability for motion stimuli.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although advanced paternal and maternal age at birth (PA/MA) increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. To explore the neuroanatomical correlates of advanced PA/MA, the current study conducted brain morphometric analyses in 39 high-functioning adult males with ASD and 39 age-, intellectual level-, and parental socioeconomic background-matched, typically developed (TD) males. Whole-brain analysis revealed that the regional gray matter volume (GMV) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (PCU) were significantly smaller in the individuals with ASD than in TD subjects (false discovery rate-corrected <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.014). Additional analyses of the constituents of GMV reduction in these brain regions revealed that the cortical thickness of the right ventral PCC was significantly thinner (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.014) and the surface area of bilateral PCU was significantly smaller (left: <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.001; right: <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.049) in the adults with ASD, compared with TD subjects. Although the analyses were exploratory, the thinner cortical thickness of right ventral PCC was significantly correlated with older PA in the ASD individuals (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.028). The current findings shed new light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the link between advanced PA and ASD.</span>

Recent years have seen a flourishing literature on detection of circulating autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These studies have generated hope for a better understanding of the underlying molecular dysfunctions and for appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, the detection of these autoantibodies in healthy subjects, and the lack of mechanistic insights have fostered debate about the pathogenic role of such autoantibodies. Here, we specifically discuss the biological evidence linking autoantibodies directed against the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR-Abs) and psychosis, emphasising recent single-molecule imaging investigations that unveiled the impaired surface trafficking of NMDAR in the presence of NMDAR-Abs from psychotic patients.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Systematic examination of the inputs and outputs of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus will facilitate the functional elucidation of this complex structure in the central auditory system. In mice, comprehensive tracing studies that reveal the long-range connectivity of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus are lacking. To this end, we used Cre-inducible anterograde and monosynaptic retrograde viruses in Calbindin-2A-dgCre-D and Calretinin-IRES-Cre mice, focusing on the differences across subdivisions of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus. We found that, 1) the dorsal and medial parts of the auditory thalamus were predominantly connected to sensory processing centers, whereas the posterior intralaminar (PIN) and peripeduncular nucleus (PP) were additionally connected to emotion and motivation modulation centers; 2) ventral auditory cortical areas were the major source of cortical inputs for all subdivisions, and the PIN/PP received more inputs from cortical layer 5 than other subdivisions did; 3) deep layers of the superior colliculus and rostral part of the nonlemniscal inferior colliculus preferentially projected to the PIN/PP; and 4) compared with the dorsal auditory thalamus, the PIN/PP mainly innervated association cortices. In addition, new brain areas connected to the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus, mostly the PIN/PP, were identified. Our results suggested subdivision-specific function of the nonlemniscal auditory thalamus in sound processing.</span>
