<p>Treatment-resistant depression was particularly associated with the functional dysconnectivity of the thalamus with the insula and superior temporal cortex, as well as the anterior paracingulate cortex and cerebellum crus II.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical connectivity is associated with cognitive and affective processing. The role of thalamocortical connectivity in the pathomechanism of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unclear. This study included 48 patients with TRD and 48 healthy individuals. We investigated thalamocortical connectivity by performing resting-state functional MRI with the bilateral thalamus as the seed. In addition, patients with TRD were evaluated using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Compared with the healthy individuals, the patients with TRD exhibited increased functional connectivity (FC) of the thalamus with the insula and superior temporal cortex and reduced the FC of the thalamus with the anterior paracingulate cortex and cerebellum crus II. Our study may support the crucial role of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in the TRD pathomechanism. However, the small sample size may limit the statistical power. A future study with a large sample size of patients with TRD would be required to validate our findings.</p>

	<p>Background: Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) remains a complex neurosurgical condition with ongoing debate regarding its optimal management. Methods: This narrative review examines key controversies surrounding the pathophysiology, surgical indications, and treatment strategies for CM1. Results: We highlight the challenges posed by the wide spectrum of CM variants and the evolving understanding of its association with syringomyelia, basilar invagination, and craniovertebral instability. Emerging surgical techniques, including minimally invasive approaches and the use of new technologies such as endoscopes and exoscopes, are evaluated for their potential to improve outcomes. Recent consensus guidelines are also discussed. Conclusions: The need for individualized treatment plans for CM1 is emphasized, with special focus put on the connection between novel pathophysiological insights, technological advancements and opportunities for a more nuanced surgical management. Further research is necessary to establish solid foundations for more individualized treatments.</p>

                <p>Ischemic stroke (IS) poses a serious threat to patient survival. The inhibition of ferroptosis can effectively alleviate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, suggesting potential targets in the ferroptosis pathway for the treatment of IS. In this study, MCAO/R mice and OGD/R-induced HT22 cell were constructed. It was found that baicalein decreased ROS, MDA, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, upregulated GSH levels, and enhanced the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins (GPX4 and SLC7A11), downregulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome <I>c</I>, and cleaved caspase-3), and upregulated the expression of an antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2), ameliorating cerebral I/R injury. In animal and cell models, Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) is downregulated, and Forkhead boxA2 (FOXA2) expression and acetylation levels are abnormally upregulated. SIRT6 inhibited FOXA2 expression and acetylation. Baicalein promoted FOXA2 deacetylation by upregulating SIRT6 expression. FOXA2 transcriptionally inhibits SLC7A11 expression. In conclusion, baicalein inhibited apoptosis and partially suppressed the role of ferroptosis to alleviate cerebral I/R injury via SIRT6-mediated FOXA2 deacetylation to promote SLC7A11 expression.</p>

                <p>This article allows readers to assess their ability to detect errors in thinking in seven case histories of psychologists&rsquo; thoughts about cognitive science. It explains the nature of the errors and shows that some of them reflect faulty reasoning. It presents a "model method" to improve reasoning. It is based on the theory of mental models, which gives a general account of how individuals think, both deductively and indicatively, and which postulates that individuals construct mental models of possibilities in the world. The model method enhances both the accuracy and speed of reasoning. The article concludes with some general reflections on the role of knowledge of meanings, the world, and context in thinking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1134/v1?src=rss">Searching for non-English literature may be unnecessary for HTA Reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Health technology assessment (HTA) reports are based on comprehensive information retrieval. Current standards discourage the use of search restrictions, such as publication date and language. Given limited resources, it was unclear whether the effort invested in screening and translating studies published in languages other than English provided relevant additional information compared with the inclusion of English-language publications alone. We therefore analysed the impact of non-English publications on the conclusions of HTA reports produced by the German HTA agency, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Methods We determined whether non-English publications were included in all HTA reports on non-drug interventions and on selected drug interventions (search period: 01/2011 to 08/2018). If at least one non-English publication was included, we assessed for each endpoint whether or not the exclusion of non-English publications changed the conclusion. If a non-English publication did not contain information relevant to the HTA report, we classified the publication as “not relevant”. Results Of 70 HTA reports, 38 (54%) included 128 non-English publications. In 4 reports (6%) with 50 endpoints investigated in 39 PICO questions, the exclusion of a total of 10 non-English publications led to a change in the conclusions for 13 endpoints (8 PICO questions). This was largely due to the fact that in many cases, non-English publications were the predominant or only literature available, resulting in a lack of analysable data after their exclusion. Conclusions In general, studies published in non-English languages have little influence on the conclusions of HTA reports. For the vast majority of topics, a language restriction to English seems justified. Studies published in non-English languages may be useful in exceptional cases, for example when an intervention is only available in certain countries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1133/v1?src=rss">A comparative analysis of the amount of fluoride release, recharge and re-release after uptake in three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives – An in-vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-601/v2?src=rss">A Case Study on Assessing AI Assistant Competence in Narrative Interviews [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

                Background The intensity and frequency of climate extremes are exacerbating agricultural droughts, particularly impacting smallholder farming. This study assessing daily precipitation and temperature extremes in the context of climate change is crucial for local-scale climate change adaptation. Spatial changes of climate indices from 1981 to 2018 in three different agroecologies in the Hamassa watershed, Ethiopia, were examined based on the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Methods We obtained Daily temperature and precipitation data from the Ethiopia National Meteorological Agency (NMA). Additionally, I used data from focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) to corroborate the findings. We conducted the Mann- Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimation to assess the significance and magnitude of rainfall and extreme temperature changes in the watershed between 1981 and 2018. Furthermore, I examined the correlation between crop and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Results The temperature data indicated that the warming condition is increasing overall agroecologies. However, the extreme indices from rainfall data indicate insignificant positive and negative trends in all agroecological zones (AEZs). The warmest day (Txx) is significantly increasing overall AEZs having magnitude values close to each other, 0.0420c, 0.03960c, and 0.03850c in the highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. The coldest day (Txn) also showed an increasing insignificant and significant trend in the highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. Results of cool days (TX10p) indicate a significant decreasing trend over all three AEZs. The magnitude of the decreasing trend is about -0.040c, -0.0450c, and -0.0360c in highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation result indicated a strong and significant relationship between crop production and climate variables (SPEI-), which varied degrees across Conclusions Results differ in different agroecologies demanding technical, institutional, and policy responses respective of Agroecologies.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002826">Reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks from a single species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaurav Baruah, Meike Wittmann</p>

Mutualistic ecological networks can suddenly transition to undesirable states due to small changes in environmental conditions. Recovering from such a collapse can be difficult as restoring the original environmental conditions may be infeasible. Additionally, such networks can also exhibit a phenomenon known as hysteresis, whereby the system could exhibit multiple states under the same environmental conditions, implying that ecological networks may not recover. Here, we attempted to revive collapsed mutualistic networks to a high-functioning state from a single species, using concepts from signal propagation theory and an eco-evolutionary model based on network structures of 115 empirical plant–pollinator networks. We found that restoring the environmental conditions rarely aided in recovery of collapsed networks, but a positive relationship between recovering pollinator density and network nestedness emerged, which was qualitatively supported by empirical plant–pollinator restoration data. In contrast, network resurrection from a collapsed state in undesirable environmental conditions where restoration has minimal impacts could be readily achieved by perturbing a single species or a few species that controls the response of the dynamical networks. Additionally, nestedness in networks and a moderate amount of trait variation could aid in the revival of networks even in undesirable environmental conditions. Our work suggests that focus should be applied to a few species whose dynamics could be steered to resurrect entire networks from a collapsed state and that network architecture could play a crucial role in reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks.

                Invasive plant species pose ecological threats to native ecosystems, particularly in areas adjacent to roadways, considering that roadways represent lengthy corridors through which invasive species can propagate. Traditional manual survey methods for monitoring invasive plants are labor-intensive and limited in coverage. This paper introduces a high-speed camera system, named CamAlien, designed to be mounted on vehicles for efficient invasive plant species monitoring along roadways. The camera system captures high-quality images at rapid intervals, to monitor the full roadside when following traffic speed. The system utilizes a global shutter sensor to reduce distortion and geotagging for precise localistion. The camera system makes it possible to collect extensive data sets, which can be used for a digital library of the invasive species and their locations, but also subsequent training of machine learning algorithms for automated species recognition.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida and other closely related genera, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 yeast Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Pichia fermentans (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Pichia kudriavzevii (24.4%), Kluyveromyces marxianus (22.2%), Clavispora lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Meyerozyma guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, together with the intrinsically resistant P. kudriavzevii, most isolates of P. fermentans, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                Introduction and Importance Cornual pregnancy (CP) is a rare and dangerous type of ectopic pregnancy, occurring in 2% to 4% of cases. Due to its atypical location in the uterine horn, it poses a high risk for severe complications, such as rupture of the uterus, and life-threatening bleeding, particularly when diagnosis is delayed. Case Presentation We report the case of a 35-year-old female patient presenting with severe pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, with 12 weeks of amenorrhea. Clinical evaluation revealed elevated β-HCG levels and transvaginal ultrasound showed a 7-week unruptured right cornual pregnancy. Surgical management involved a mini-laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis and a cornuostomy along with a right salpingectomy was performed. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up confirmed complete recovery. Clinical Discussion Cornual pregnancies, though rare, carry a significant risk of serious complications and maternal death due to delayed diagnosis. Risk factors encompass a history of miscarriage, elective abortion, sexually transmitted infections, and smoking, all contributing to abnormal implantation. Early diagnosis is challenging but crucial, with ultrasound being key for detection. Management depends on gestational age, patient stability, and future reproductive plans, with methotrexate or surgical intervention being standard options. Conclusion Cornual pregnancy, despite its rarity, demands prompt and accurate diagnosis to prevent catastrophic outcomes. This case underscores the need for individualized treatment strategies and highlights the importance of early intervention. Ongoing research is vital to improving diagnostic approaches and therapeutic outcomes.

                Background Free radical attacks have been implicated in the aetiology of many diseases and several plants are used traditionally for the management of many oxidative-stress related diseases. Khaya senegalensis is used traditionally for the management diseases such as diabetes and for the treatment of infections. However, mechanisms underlying actions of K. senegalensis are poorly understood. Purpose This study aimed at the preliminary determination of the phytochemical constituents and investigation of the antioxidative and hepatoprotective actions of K. senegalensis in acetaminophen-treated rats. Method Aqueous extracts of K. senegalensis were screened for the presence of key phytochemicals. Total flavonoid and phenolic contents were quantified. Wistar albino rats were pre-treated with saline (control) or graded concentrations of K. senegalensis (50 – 200mg/kgbw) for 10 days prior to acetaminophen (2g/kg body weight) administration. Serum levels of vitamin C, thiobarbituric reactive substances, catalase activities, enzyme markers of liver function were assessed. Cholesterol-phospholipid ratio in treated-rats were determined. Results K. senegalensis extract showed the presence of saponins, tannins, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were determined as 57.14±0.85mgQE/g and 51.72±0.77mgGE/g. Acetaminophen (2g/kg bw) raised serum TBARS (4.7-fold, P<0.001), H2O2 levels (2.3-fold, P<0.001), AST (5.9-fold, P<0.001), ALT (6.6-fold, P<0.001) and ALP (4.2-fold, P<0.001) and reduced serum levels of vitamin C (54%, P<0.001) and catalase activity (74.6%, P<0.001). Treatment of K. senegalensis extracts inhibited effects of acetaminophen on TBARS (18.2% - 46.4%, P<0.05 – 0.001), vitamin C (1.4 – 1.8-fold, P<0.001 – 0.05), H2O2 levels (19.1 – 50.1%, P<0.001-0.05), catalase activities (1.4 – 3.1-fold, P<0.001 – 0.05), AST (27.7 – 62.8%, P<0.001 – 0.05), ALT (35.6 – 57.5%, P<0.001 – 0.05) and ALP (15.9 – 46.2%, P<0.01 – 0.05). The extract reduced cholesterol-phospholipid ratio (21 – 31%, P<0.05). Conclusion These results motivate further development of the therapeutic potential of K. senegalensis

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been successfully treated using biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These medications are not utilized as first-line treatment, in part because of their high cost, but they are frequently seen to be cost-effective for RA patient populations that do not respond adequately to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Moreover, not all RA patients who meet clinical eligibility criteria can access biologics, not even as second-line therapy. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in biosimilars that are highly comparable to their originator biologics in terms of efficacy and safety but generally come at a lower price. This review summarizes the potential role of biosimilars in reducing RA expenditure and increasing RA patient access to biologic therapies. As the global landscape for biosimilars continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the unique challenges and opportunities in different healthcare systems. By leveraging the potential of biosimilars, healthcare systems can improve RA management, ease its economic burden and ensure that patients have access to effective and affordable treatments. The future of RA treatment lies in the integration of biosimilars into clinical practice, offering hope for more sustainable and equitable healthcare systems.

<p>We generated Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–ChR2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–ChR2 mice that exhibited nocifensive behavior to blue light exposure. All Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice showed no behavioral differences in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli compared to wild-type mice.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels, including Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9, play important roles in pain transmission and chronic pain development. However, the specific mechanisms of their action remain unclear, highlighting the need for in vivo stimulation studies of these channels. Optogenetics, a novel technique for targeting the activation or inhibition of specific neural circuits using light, offers a promising solution. In our previous study, we used optogenetics to selectively excite Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-expressing neurons in the dorsal root ganglion of mice to induce nocifensive behavior. Here, we further characterize the impact of nocifensive behavior by activation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9-expressing neurons. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–iCre, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–iCre, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–iCre mice expressing iCre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 gene promoter were produced. These mice were then bred with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) Cre–reporter Ai32 mice to obtain Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–ChR2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–ChR2 mice. Blue light exposure triggered paw withdrawal in all mice, with the strongest response in Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2 mice. These light sensitivity differences observed across Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice may be dependent on ChR2 expression or reflect the inherent disparities in their pain transmission roles. In conclusion, we have generated noninvasive pain models, with optically activated peripheral nociceptors. We believe that studies using optogenetics will further elucidate the role of sodium channel subtypes in pain transmission.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Empathy is usually regarded as the ability to perceive the emotional state of others, which is an altruistic motivation to promote prosocial behavior and thus plays a key role in human life and social development. Empathic pain—the capacity to feel and understand the pain of others—constitutes a significant aspect in the study of empathy behaviors. For an extended duration, investigations into empathic pain have predominantly centered on human neuroimaging studies. Fortunately, recent advancements have witnessed the utilization of animal models in the exploration of the fundamental neural underpinnings of empathic pain. There is substantial evidence implicating multiple brain regions and neural networks in the generation and maintenance of empathic pain. Nevertheless, further elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying empathic pain is warranted. This review provides a concise overview of prior studies on the neural mechanisms of empathic pain, outlining the pertinent brain regions, neural pathways, synaptic mechanisms, and associated molecules while also delving into future prospects.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The mammalian brain comprises two structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the gray matter (GM) and the white matter (WM). In humans, the WM constitutes approximately half of the brain volume, yet it remains significantly less investigated than the GM. The major cellular elements of the WM are neuronal axons and glial cells. However, the WM also contains cell bodies of the interstitial neurons, estimated to number 10 to 28 million in the adult bat brain, 67 million in Lar gibbon brain, and 450 to 670 million in the adult human brain, representing as much as 1.3%, 2.25%, and 3.5% of all neurons in the cerebral cortex, respectively. Many studies investigated the interstitial WM neurons (IWMNs) using immunohistochemistry, and some information is available regarding their electrophysiological properties. However, the functional role of IWMNs in physiologic and pathologic conditions largely remains unknown. This review aims to provide a concise update regarding the distribution and properties of interstitial WM neurons, highlight possible functions of these cells as debated in the literature, and speculate about other possible functions of the IWMNs and their interactions with glial cells. We hope that our review will inspire new research on IWMNs, which represent an intriguing cell population in the brain.

                The monoaminergic nuclei are thought to be some of the earliest sites of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in the brain, with tau-containing pretangles appearing in these nuclei decades before the onset of clinical impairments. It has increasingly been recognized that monoamine systems represent a critical target of investigation towards understanding the progression of AD and designing early detection and treatment approaches. This review synthesizes evidence across animal studies, human neuropathology, and state-of-the-art neuroimaging and daily life assessment methods in humans, which demonstrate robust relationships between monoamine systems and AD pathophysiology and behavior. Further, the review highlights the promise of multimethod, multisystem approaches to studying monoaminergic mechanisms of resilience to AD pathology.

                Meng et al. characterize transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) as a key adaptive dependency of oncogenic KRAS in human PDAC. Their work uncovers the base-excision repair (BER) pathway as a key regulator of TRCs. Inhibition of the BER pathway altered transcription dynamics and activated ATR checkpoint. Co-inhibition of the BER and ATR pathway produced lethal DNA damage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91634">The role of Imp and Syp RNA-binding proteins in precise neuronal elimination by apoptosis through the regulation of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal stem cells generate a limited and consistent number of neuronal progenies, each possessing distinct morphologies and functions, which are crucial for optimal brain function. Our study focused on a neuroblast (NB) lineage in <i>Drosophila</i> known as Lin A/15, which generates motoneurons (MNs) and glia. Intriguingly, Lin A/15 NB dedicates 40% of its time to producing immature MNs (iMNs) that are subsequently eliminated through apoptosis. Two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, play crucial roles in this process. Imp+ MNs survive, while Imp−, Syp+ MNs undergo apoptosis. Genetic experiments show that Imp promotes survival, whereas Syp promotes cell death in iMNs. Late-born MNs, which fail to express a functional code of transcription factors (mTFs) that control their morphological fate, are subject to elimination. Manipulating the expression of Imp and Syp in Lin A/15 NB and progeny leads to a shift of TF code in late-born MNs toward that of early-born MNs, and their survival. Additionally, introducing the TF code of early-born MNs into late-born MNs also promoted their survival. These findings demonstrate that the differential expression of Imp and Syp in iMNs links precise neuronal generation and distinct identities through the regulation of mTFs. Both Imp and Syp are conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that they play a fundamental role in precise neurogenesis across species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87928">Whole genomes from the extinct Xerces Blue butterfly can help identify declining insect species</a></h4>

              
                The Xerces Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche xerces</i>) is considered to be the first butterfly to become extinct in historical times. It was notable for its chalky lavender wings with conspicuous white spots on the ventral wings. The last individuals were collected in their restricted habitat, in the dunes near the Presidio military base in San Francisco, in 1941. We sequenced the genomes of four 80- to 100-year-old Xerces Blue, and seven historical and one modern specimens of its closest relative, the Silvery Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche lygdamus</i>). We compared these to a novel annotated genome of the Green-Underside Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche alexis</i>). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from complete mitochondrial genomes indicate that Xerces Blue was a distinct species that diverged from the Silvery Blue lineage at least 850,000 years ago. Using nuclear genomes, both species experienced population growth during the Eemian interglacial period, but the Xerces Blue decreased to a very low effective population size subsequently, a trend opposite to that observed in the Silvery Blue. Runs of homozygosity and deleterious load in the former were significantly greater than in the later, suggesting a higher incidence of inbreeding. These signals of population decline observed in Xerces Blue could be used to identify and monitor other insects threatened by human activities, whose extinction patterns are still not well known.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86827">A MSTNDel73C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep by CRISPR/Cas9 promotes skeletal muscle myofiber hyperplasia</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the well-known Myostatin (<i>MSTN</i>) produce a ‘double-muscle’ phenotype, which makes it commercially invaluable for improving livestock meat production and providing high-quality protein for humans. However, mutations at different loci of the <i>MSTN</i> often produce a variety of different phenotypes. In the current study, we increased the delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA from the traditional 1:2 to 1:10, which improves the efficiency of the homozygous mutation of biallelic gene. Here, a <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout sheep, in which the <i>MSTN</i> and <i>FGF5</i> dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutations were produced via the deletion of 3-base pairs of AGC in the third exon of <i>MSTN</i>, resulting in cysteine-depleted at amino acid position 73, and the <i>FGF5</i> double allele mutation led to inactivation of <i>FGF5</i> gene. The <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout sheep highlights a dominant ‘double-muscle’ phenotype, which can be stably inherited. Both F0 and F1 generation mutants highlight the excellent trait of high-yield meat with a smaller cross-sectional area and higher number of muscle fibers per unit area. Mechanistically, the <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout mediated the activation of <i>FOSL1</i> via the MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis. The activated <i>FOSL1</i> promotes skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the expression of MyoD1, and resulting in smaller myotubes. In addition, activated ERK1/2 may inhibit the secondary fusion of myotubes by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CaMKII activation pathway, leading to myoblasts fusion to form smaller myotubes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95427">Noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive sprouting angiogenesis in zebrafish via foxo1a-marcksl1a signal</a></h4>

              
                Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced <i>foxo1a</i> mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of <i>marcksl1a</i>. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94849">Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase activates type I interferon-dependent antitumor immunity by bridging cGAS-STING pathway</a></h4>

              
                The <i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an essential enzyme that mediates protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation, a unique form of posttranslational modification of many nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Recent studies observed increased OGT and <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation levels in a broad range of human cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, indicating a universal effect of OGT in promoting tumorigenesis. Here, we show that OGT is essential for tumor growth in immunocompetent mice by repressing the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-dependent DNA sensing pathway. We found that deletion of OGT (<i>Ogt<sup>−/−</sup></i>) caused a marked reduction in tumor growth in both syngeneic mice tumor models and a genetic mice colorectal cancer (CRC) model induced by mutation of the <i>Apc</i> gene (<i>Apc<sup>min</sup></i>). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of OGT induced a robust genomic instability (GIN), leading to cGAS-dependent production of the type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). As a result, deletion of <i>Cgas</i> or <i>Sting</i> from <i>Ogt<sup>−/−</sup></i> cancer cells restored tumor growth, and this correlated with impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we found that OGT-dependent cleavage of host cell factor C1 (HCF-1) is required for the avoidance of GIN and IFN-I production in tumors. In summary, our results identify OGT-mediated genomic stability and activate cGAS-STING pathway as an important tumor-cell-intrinsic mechanism to repress antitumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86860">A chromatic feature detector in the retina signals visual context changes</a></h4>

              
                The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been studied extensively in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a nonlinear selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of changes in visual context. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour opponency in transient suppressed-by-contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts. This type of chromatic contrast was characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head or eye movements across the horizon. Because tSbC cells performed best among all RGC types at reliably detecting these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99194">Cyclic di-GMP as an antitoxin regulates bacterial genome stability and antibiotic persistence in biofilms</a></h4>

              
                Biofilms are complex bacterial communities characterized by a high persister prevalence, which contributes to chronic and relapsing infections. Historically, persister formation in biofilms has been linked to constraints imposed by their dense structures. However, we observed an elevated persister frequency accompanying the stage of cell adhesion, marking the onset of biofilm development. Subsequent mechanistic studies uncovered a comparable type of toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (TA-like system) triggered by cell adhesion, which is responsible for this elevation. In this module, the toxin HipH acts as a genotoxic deoxyribonuclease, inducing DNA double strand breaks and genome instability. While the second messenger c-di-GMP functions as the antitoxin, exerting control over HipH expression and activity. The dynamic interplay between c-di-GMP and HipH levels emerges as a crucial determinant governing genome stability and persister generation within biofilms. These findings unveil a unique TA system, where small molecules act as the antitoxin, outlining a biofilm-specific molecular mechanism influencing genome stability and antibiotic persistence, with potential implications for treating biofilm infections.

">Discovering Temporally Compositional Neural Manifolds with Switching Infinite GPFA</a></h4>

              
                Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) is a powerful latent variable model for extracting low-dimensional manifolds underlying population neural activities. However, one limitation of standard GPFA models is that the number of latent factors needs to be pre-specified or selected through heuristic-based processes, and that all factors contribute at all times. We propose the infinite GPFA model, a fully Bayesian non-parametric extension of the classical GPFA by incorporating an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior over the factor loading process, such that it is possible to infer a potentially infinite set of latent factors, and the identity of those factors that contribute to neural firings in a compositional manner at each time point. Learning and inference in the infinite GPFA model is performed through variational expectation-maximisation, and we additionally propose scalable extensions based on sparse variational Gaussian Process methods. We empirically demonstrate that the infinite GPFA model correctly infers dynamically changing activations of latent factors on a synthetic dataset. By fitting the infinite GPFA model to population activities of hippocampal place cells during spatial navigation, we identify non-trivial and behaviourally meaningful dynamics in the neural encoding process.

">Test-retest reliability of perturbation-evoked cortical activity reflects stable individual differences in reactive balance control</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing interest in measuring cortical activity during balance control for understanding mechanisms of impaired balance with aging and neurological dysfunction. The most well-characterized electrophysiological signal elicited by a balance disturbance is the perturbation-evoked N1 potential that peaks 100-200 msec post-perturbation and is thought to reflect error processing. We previously found associations between the N1 and individual differences in balance ability, suggesting it may be a potential biomarker of balance health. However, a potential biomarker of balance function will be limited by its reliability and clinical feasibility, which has yet to be established. Here, we characterized the reliability of the N1 elicited by standing balance perturbations within and between sessions over a one-week interval in 10 younger and 14 older adults. A subset of older adults (n=12) completed a session approximately one year prior to the main experiment. We extracted N1 amplitude and latency from the Cz electrode using an advanced, computationally-intensive approach that relies on large amounts of data (e.g., 64 channels, many trials), Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency was quantified by split-half reliability using the Spearman correlation coefficient. N1s varied across individuals (amplitude:12-82V, latency: 142-282ms), yet within individuals, the N1 showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>0.9) across a one-week and one-year time span. N1 amplitude reached excellent internal reliability for each session and group (r>0.9), that generally plateaued within 6 trials, while more trials were needed to reliably measure N1 latency. Similar results were obtained when quantifying N1s using a minimal approach performed with only three electrodes and simple preprocessing. Overall, the N1 is stable within and across sessions, and is largely independent of approach suggesting it could be a clinically-feasible biomarker of balance function. Characterizing reliability in populations with neurologic dysfunction and in different environmental contexts will be necessary to enhance our understanding of the N1, optimize experimental design, and determine its predictive validity of clinical outcomes (e.g., falls risk).

">Modulation of sweet preference by neurosteroid-sensitive, δ-GABAA receptors in adult mouse gustatory insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                Taste preference is a fundamental driver of feeding behavior influencing dietary choices and eating patterns. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that the gustatory cortex (GC) is engaged in taste perception, palatability and preference. However, our knowledge of the neural and neurochemical signals regulating taste preference is rather limited. Neuromodulators can affect preferences, though their effects on neural circuits for taste are incompletely understood. Neurosteroids are of particular interest in view of reports that systemic administration of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a potent modulator of tonic GABAergic inhibition, induces hyperphagia and increases intake of energy rich food in human and animal subjects. Tonic inhibition is a powerful modulator of circuit excitability and is primarily mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors containing the delta subunit ({delta}-GABAARs). These receptors are widely distributed in the brain, but information regarding the expression of {delta}-GABAARs within gustatory circuits is lacking, and their role in taste preference has not been investigated. Here, we focused on GC to investigate whether activation of {delta}-GABAARs affects sweet taste preference in adult mice. Our data reveal that {delta}-GABAARs are expressed in multiple cell types within GC. These receptors mediate an allopregnanolone-sensitive tonic current and decrease sweet taste preference by altering the behavioral sensitivity to sucrose concentration in a cell type-specific manner. Our findings demonstrate that taste sensitivity and preference in the adult mammalian brain are modulated by tonic inhibition mediated by neurosteroid-activated {delta}-GABAARs in GC.

">Early Postnatal Dysfunction of mPFC PV Interneurons in Shank3B-/- Mice</a></h4>

              
                Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dysfunction is associated with cognitive and sensory abnormalities in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the trajectory of mPFC circuit development in these conditions remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the postnatal maturation of glutamatergic connectivity and neuronal excitability in pyramidal neurons (PYR) and parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIN) in the mPFC of mice harboring deletions in SHANK3, a well-established genetic cause of autism associated with severe cognitive impairments and seizures. Our findings reveal early deficits in PVIN excitability that precede changes in the synaptic and intrinsic properties of PYR, resulting in impaired feedforward inhibition. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated hypoactivity of PVIN in dorsal mPFC circuits during early postnatal development, characterized by reduced calcium transients in PVIN. By adulthood, these excitability phenotypes were reversed, with PVIN becoming hyperexcitable and PYR hypoexcitable. These results suggest that early PVIN dysfunction in Shank3B-/- mice emerges during postnatal development and may represent a key pathogenic mechanism and potential therapeutic target in SHANK3-related disorders.

">Finding Agreement: fMRI-hyperscanning reveals that dyads explore in mental state space to align opinions.</a></h4>

              
                Many prize synchrony as the ingredient that turns a conversation from a debate into a delightful duet. Yet, learning from other people's diverging opinions can also foster understanding and agreement, satisfy curiosity, and spur imagination. Using fMRI hyperscanning and natural language processing we tested how two debaters navigate conflictual conversations to find agreement. Dyads (N=60) discussed pressing societal problems while being instructed to either persuade their partner or compromise with each other. Our analysis uncovered three key insights: First, individuals instructed to compromise rather than persuade tended to agree more at the end of the session. Second, hyperscanning and linguistic analyses revealed that encouraging compromise resulted in increased exploration during conversations; dyads given compromise instructions traversed more diverse mental states and topics. Third, heightened exploration was linked to greater eventual agreement. Notably, the effect of the compromise instruction on agreement was entirely mediated by the degree of exploration. Together, these results suggest that trying to find agreement may be spurred by exploration, something that happens when people are motivated to compromise but not persuade.

">Regulation of REM Sleep Onset and Homeostasis by Preoptic Glutamatergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The preoptic area of the hypothalamus is key for the control of sleep onset and sleep homeostasis. Although traditionally considered exclusively somnogenic, recent studies identified a group of preoptic glutamatergic neurons that promote wakefulness. Specifically, our previous investigations demonstrated that chemogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons within the medial-lateral preoptic area (MLPO_VGLUT2) promotes wakefulness, fragments non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMs), and suppresses REM sleep (REMs). This evidence is further supported by recent work showing that preoptic glutamatergic neurons are activated during microarousals that fragment sleep in response to stress, and optogenetic stimulation of these neurons promotes microarousals and wakefulness. Thus, while the wake-promoting function of MLPO_VGLUT2 is clear, their role in sleep homeostasis has not been assessed. We tested the hypothesis that MLPO_VGLUT2 are wake-active, and their activation will increase wakefulness and disrupt sleep homeostasis via projections to arousal-promoting systems. Using fiber photometry, we found that MLPO_VGLUT2 were highly active during REMs, wakefulness and brief arousals, and remained minimally active during NREMs. Chemogenetic stimulation of MLPO_VGLUT2 inhibited REMs onset and suppressed the REMs homeostatic response after total sleep deprivation. Chemogenetic inhibition of MLPO_VGLUT2 increased REMs time (during the light phase only) but did not influence REMs and NREMs homeostasis. Anterograde projection mapping revealed that MLPO_VGLUT2 innervate central regions that promote wakefulness and inhibit REMs. We conclude that MLPO_VGLUT2 powerfully suppress REMs and that exogenous (and possibly pathologic) activation of these neurons disrupts REMs recovery, presumably by directly or indirectly activating REMs-inhibitory mechanisms.

">Spatial and network principles behind neural generation of locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Generation of locomotion is a fundamental function of the spinal cord, yet the underlying principles remain unclear. In particular, the relationship between neuronal cell types, networks and function has been difficult to establish. Here, we propose principles by which functions arise primarily from spatial features of the cord. First, we suggest that distinct cell types with dissimilar length of projection constitute an asymmetrical "Mexican hat" topology, i.e. local excitation and surrounding inhibition, along the rostro-caudal axis. Second, the transversal segregation of cell types conveniently allows synapses to form with appropriate targets. We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics. We find that essential aspects of locomotion are recapitulated and easily controlled, and several experimental observations can now be explained mechanistically. Further, two main features are predicted: propagating bumps of neural activity and asymmetric neuronal projections with local excitation and wider inhibition. Besides linking cell types, structure and function, our approach provides a unifying framework for understanding motor activity across limbed and undulatory species.

">Bilateral Symmetry and Asymmetry in the C. elegans Connectome: A Graph-Theoretic Analysis based on Redundancy Measures</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the balance between symmetry and asymmetry in animal nervous systems is crucial for unraveling the complexities of neural architectures and their functions. Previous studies have primarily focused on morphological symmetry, such as neuron placement, leaving the symmetry in the functional architecture largely unexplored. The current study investigates this aspect within the Caenorhabditis elegans connectomes by introducing a graph-theoretic approach. By defining a 'mirror-symmetry index,' we quantitatively assess the symmetry in these connectomes, revealing a significant level of bilateral symmetry alongside notable asymmetry. Our approach also incorporates measures including connectivity similarity, motif-fingerprint differences, and path-compensation index to evaluate the network's functional redundancy and its capacity to compensate for unilateral disturbances. Here we show the C. elegans connectomes' robust bilateral symmetry, which not only facilitates similar functions across neuron pairs but also ensures resilience against disruptions. This redundancy is not confined to symmetrical connections; it also includes asymmetric ones, adding to the neural network's complexity. An in-depth analysis into different neuron types shows varied redundancy levels: high in interneurons, moderate in motor neurons, and low in sensory neurons. This pattern suggests a strategic neural design where diverse inputs from sensory neurons, coupled with the stable integration by interneurons, lead to coordinated actions through motor neurons. This study advances our understanding of neural connectomes, offering insights into the intricate balance of symmetry and asymmetry in neural systems and their implications for complex, adaptive behaviors.

">An electrophysiological study about the pharmacological manipulation of the immediate consequences of a spinal trauma reveals a crucial role for TRPV4 antagonism.</a></h4>

              
                A physical trauma to the spinal cord produces an immediate massive depolarizing injury potential accompanied both by a transient episode of spinal hypoxia, and an extensive cell loss at the level of injury, which interrupts conduction of longitudinal input along white matter tracts. Afterwards, the transient hypotonia and areflexia characterize the following spinal shock phase. The relationship between the extent of injury potentials and spinal cord injury (SCI) progression, as well as the potential pharmacological modulation of the immediate consequences of a trauma, have not yet been explored. To limit the peak of injury potentials and speed up recovery of reflex motor responses, we serially applied selective neurochemicals in the exact moment of an experimental physical trauma delivered through a calibrated device impacting the mid-thoracic cord of an entire CNS preparation of neonatal rats. Continuous lumbar root recordings monitored baseline DC-levels and reflex responses elicited by trains of electric pulses applied to sacrocaudal afferents. In uninjured preparations, each agent showed distinct effects on baseline polarization, modulation of synaptic responses, and appearance of bursting activity. Interestingly, neurochemicals acting on glutamatergic-, adenosinergic-, glycinergic- or GABAergic receptors, did not affect the monitored outcome when each parameter was normalized against pre-injury values. Conversely, the selective TRPV4 antagonist, RN1734, unlike the TRPA1 antagonist, AP18, reduced peak of injury potentials and speeded up full recovery of reflex responses within 1 min from trauma. Similarly, blockage of gap junctions quickly, yet partially, restored motor reflexes, while antagonism of GABAA receptors restored full reflexes, though slightly later. The current study indicates that both mechanosensitive TRPV4 receptors and GABAergic transmission reduce the immediate pathological consequences of a trauma when applied at the moment of impact, envisaging a clinical translation for preventing accidental spinal lesions during the most delicate spinal surgeries.

">Multisensory gamma stimulation enhances adult neurogenesis and improves cognitive function in a mouse model of Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS) has been linked with deficits in hippocampal dependent cognitive tasks and adult neurogenesis, yet treatment options are still very limited. We and others previously showed that a non-invasive multisensory gamma stimulation using light and sound at 40 Hz ameliorated Alzheimers disease pathology and symptoms in mouse models. In this study, we tested the effects of 40 Hz multisensory stimulation in the Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. For three weeks, mice were exposed daily to one hour of stimulation or one hour of ambient light and sound. Mice receiving the stimulation showed improved object recognition and spatial working memory. Using single nuclei RNA-seq and experimental validations in mouse hippocampal samples, we identified underlying expression changes in gene regulatory networks and demonstrated increased adult neurogenesis and reorganization of synapses as potential mechanisms for these improved cognitive phenotypes. Together, our data reveal a novel effect of multisensory gamma stimulation on adult neurogenesis and beneficial effects of 40 Hz treatment on cognitive function in DS model mice.

">Parallel neuroinflammatory pathways to cerebrovascular injury and amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Importance: While the hallmark pathologies of amyloid-beta and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are well documented and even part of the definition, upstream neuroinflammation is thought to play an important role but remains poorly understood. Objectives: We tested whether two distinct neuroinflammatory markers are associated with cerebrovascular injury and amyloid-beta, and whether these markers are associated with plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau) concentration, medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and memory deficits. We examined neuroinflammatory markers plasma YKL-40 and GFAP, due to previous conflicting evidence relating YKL-40 and GFAP to AD pathogenic markers. Design: Cross-sectional data from a community observational study (Biomarker Exploration in Aging, Cognition, and Neurodegeneration - BEACoN) were included. Setting: All participants were enrolled in a single site, at University of California, Irvine. Participants: 126 participants were included if they had at least one of the following measures available: neuropsychological data, MRI, amyloid-PET, or plasma. Exposures: Plasma YKL-40 and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. Main outcomes and measures: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, 18F-florbetapir (FBP) PET mean SUVR, plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau-217) concentration, MTL cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and memory function assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Using path analysis, we tested whether higher plasma YKL-40 and GFAP are associated with WMH and amyloid-beta, and whether these converge to downstream markers of tauopathy, MTL neurodegeneration, and memory deficits. Results: In older adults without dementia (N=126, age=70.60+6.29, 62% women), we found that higher plasma YKL-40 concentration was associated with greater WMH volume, while higher plasma GFAP concentration was related to increased FBP SUVR. Further, higher plasma GFAP, WMH and FBP SUVR were independently associated with increased pTau-217. In turn, plasma pTau-217 was associated with reduced MTL cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Subsequently, only reduced hippocampal volume was related to lower memory function. Conclusions and Relevance: Neuroinflammatory markers contribute to parallel pathways of cerebrovascular injury and amyloid-beta, which converge to tau-associated neurodegeneration and memory deficits in older adults. These observations underscore the need for a more comprehensive approach to developing an AD framework and treatment strategies.

">Conflict neurons in cingulate cortex of macaques</a></h4>

              
                Conflict, the magnitude of co-activation of mutually incompatible response processes, was proposed to explain how cognitive control is invoked (Botvinick et al. 2001) and continues to engage debate (Becker et al. 2024). Original observations consistent with this construct emphasized the primary contribution of cingulate cortex (CC) based on human functional imaging (Botvinick et al., 1999; Carter et al., 2000) and electroencephalogram (Yeung, Botvinick, & Cohen, 2004). In countermanding tasks conflict arises through co-activation of competing GO and STOP processes (Boucher et al. 2007; Schall & Boucher 2007; Sajad et al. 2022). Single neuron activity representing conflict has been described in the supplementary motor cortex of human epilepsy patients (Fu et al., 2019; Sheth et al., 2012) and of macaque monkeys (Sajad, Errington, & Schall, 2022; Stuphorn, Taylor, & Schall, 2000) and in human cingulate cortex (Fu et al., 2019; Sheth et al., 2012) but not in monkey cingulate cortex (Ebitz & Platt, 2015; Ito, Stuphorn, Brown, & Schall, 2003; Nakamura, Roesch, & Olson, 2005). This lack of homology generated debate about the utility of macaques for investigation of cognitive control (Cole et al. 2009; Schall & Emeric 2010). With higher-resolution, less-biased samples, we re-examined the presence of a conflict signal in cingulate cortex of monkeys. Neurons modulating specifically when response conflict was maximal were found in cingulate cortex, more commonly in the dorsal than the ventral bank. However, such neurons were much more common in supplementary motor cortex. These data confirm the presence of a conflict signal in medial frontal cortex and demonstrate that it can be found in a small fraction of neurons in cingulate cortex. Further research is needed to determine if the weak response conflict signal in cingulate cortex is sufficient or negligible.

">Generating brain-wide connectome using synthetic axonal morphologies</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental advancements, including electron microscopy reconstructions, have produced detailed connectivity data for local brain regions. On the other hand, large-scale imaging techniques such as MRI provide insights into inter-regional connectivity. However, understanding the links between local and long-range connectivity is essential to studying the healthy and pathological conditions of the brain. Leveraging a novel dataset of whole-brain axonal reconstructions, we present a technique to predict whole-brain connectivity at single cell level by generating detailed whole-brain axonal morphologies from sparse experimental data. The computationally generated axons accurately reproduce the local and global morphological properties of experimental reconstructions. Furthermore, the computationally synthesized axons generate large-scale inter-regional connectivity, defining the projectome and the connectome of the brain, thereby enabling the in-silico experimentation of large brain regions.

">Contextual Neural Dynamics During Time Perception in Primate Ventral Premotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how time perception adapts to cognitive demands remains a significant challenge. In some contexts, the brain encodes time categorically (as long or short), while in others, it encodes precise time intervals on a continuous scale. Although the ventral premotor cortex (VPC) is known for its role in complex temporal processes, such as speech, its specific involvement in time estimation remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated how the VPC processes temporal information during a time interval comparison task (TICT) and a time interval categorization task (TCT) in primates. We found a notable heterogeneity in neuronal responses associated with time perception across both tasks. While most neurons responded during time interval presentation, a smaller subset retained this information during the working memory periods. Population-level analysis revealed distinct dynamics between tasks: in TICT, population activity exhibited a linear and parametric relationship with interval duration, whereas in TCT, neuronal activity diverged into two distinct dynamics corresponding to the interval categories. During delay periods, these categorical or parametric representations remained consistent within each task context. This contextual shift underscores the VPC's adaptive role in interval estimation and highlights how temporal representations are modulated by cognitive demands.

">Autophagy, the Ubiquitin proteasome system, and the MAPK pathway control the temperature dependence of synaptic growth.</a></h4>

              
                There is clear evidence that Earth's temperature is rising at an unprecedented rate. While consequences on ecosystems are being extensively studied, little is known about the consequences of temperature on the nervous system of ectothermic animals. Here we used the Drosophila model NMJ to assess the effect of temperature on the synaptic growth of a phasic, and a tonic, motoneuron. We find that the tonic neuron's synaptic size is not affected by temperature, however we do observe a temperature-dependent synaptic growth in the phasic neuron, which might be related to the increased motility observed previously at higher temperatures. We find that the level of autophagy activity changes with temperature and that autophagy genes are responsible for the temperature dependence of synaptic growth. We present evidence that this regulation could occur through the major synaptic growth regulator and ubiquitin ligase Highwire, and a pathway involving the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases. We present a new function for the MAPKKK, Wallenda and the MAPK P38b in directing the additional synaptic growth that takes place between 25{degrees}C and 29{degrees}C. This illustrates that temperature has different effects on a diverse population of neurons and that distinct genetic pathways are involved in regulating temperature driven changes.

">Aperiodic neural excitation of the prefrontal cortex offsets age-related decrease in hippocampal theta activity for spatial memory maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Currently, there is a critical gap in age-related electrophysiological changes in the human brain and how they are correlated with individual decline and maintenance of spatial cognitive function. To characterize these complex neurocognitive changes using direct intracranial recordings, we isolated periodic band power from the aperiodic spectral slope from iEEG power spectra of 69 presurgical epilepsy patients between 19 and 61 years of age while they performed a virtual spatial navigation task. We found a flattening of aperiodic spectral slope in the prefrontal cortex, but also observed a steepening in the hippocampus, suggestive of region-specific changes in excitatory/inhibitory balance across aging. The hippocampus showed pronounced changes in periodic (oscillatory) activity, including a decrease in theta power that correlated with impaired spatial memory, potentially due to changes in the cholinergic system. Interestingly, individuals with the flatter spectral slope in DLPFC showed preserved performance despite lower hippocampal theta, indicating a potential compensatory mechanism for cognitive maintenance. These findings provide new evidence that individual age-related cognitive decline can be predicted by changes in hippocampal theta oscillation, in combination with concomitant prefrontal compensatory mechanisms.

                This preliminary study was conducted to explore the effects of bilingualism on executive function development in children ages 3 to 5 years old. Two groups (bilinguals and monolinguals) were recruited across various sites in Southern Alberta. Children were assessed through parent rated executive function using the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function Preschool version, a standardized assessment of executive function in children aged 2 years, 0 months through 5 years, 11 months. The questionnaire contains 63 items measuring 5 aspects of executive functioning, inhibit, shift, emotional control, working memory, and plan/organize. Children were also assessed using a battery of executive function tasks, which include the reverse categorization, pictorial Stroop, Dimensional Change Card Sort, backward digit span, and dyadic social play. Results show that bilingual children outperform monolinguals on the emotional control scale, dimensional change card sort and dyadic social play. Despite the controversial literature surrounding bilingualisms impact on executive function, the study reveals support for second language use to improve areas of executive function among young children.

">Same bi-directional modulation of contrast appearance for voluntary presaccadic attention and involuntary exogenous attention</a></h4>

              
                Different types of attention alter subjective visual perception in fundamentally distinct ways. Previous studies have focused on covert attention without concurrent eye movements, showing that covert exogenous (involuntary) attention enhances contrast appearance of low-contrast stimuli while diminishing that of high-contrast stimuli, whereas covert endogenous (voluntary) attention uniformly enhances contrast appearance. However, the attentional effect preceding saccadic eye movements, a critical component of natural vision, remain understudied. Here, we found that when participants voluntarily initiated saccades, presaccadic attention enhanced the appearance of low-contrast stimuli while attenuating the appearance of high-contrast stimuli (Experiment 1, N = 29 adults). This pattern is surprisingly similar to exogenous attention but distinct from endogenous attention. Notably, the presaccadic attentional attenuation effect accumulated gradually during saccade preparation and remained positively correlated with the exogenous attentional effect (Experiment 2, N = 24 adults). These findings suggest a shared mechanism between presaccadic and exogenous attention in shaping visual perception.

">Single and paired TMS pulses engage spatially distinct corticomotor representations in human pericentral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) can assess corticomotor function in humans by evoking motor evoked potentials (MEP). Paired-pulse TMS at peri-threshold intensity elicits short-latency intracortical facilitation (SICF) with early peaks at inter-pulse intervals of 1.0-1.8ms (SICF1) and 2.4-3ms (SICF2). The similarity between the periodicity of SICF and indirect (I-)waves in the corticospinal volleys evoked by single-pulse TMS suggests that SICF originates from I-wave generating circuits. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of MEP generation by mapping the corticomotor representations of single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS targeting SICF1 and SICF2 peaks in 14 participants (7 female). MEPs were recorded from two hand muscles and the spatial properties of each corticomotor map were analyzed. For both hand muscles, we found a consistent posterior shift of the center-of-gravity (CoG) for SICF maps compared to single-pulse maps, with a larger shift for SICF1. CoG displacement in the SICF1 map correlated with individual SICF1 latencies. Further, ADM maps consistently peaked more medially than FDI maps and paired-pulse TMS resulted in larger corticomotor maps than single-pulse TMS. This is the first study to show that circuits responsible for SICF have a more posterior representation in the precentral crown than those generating MEPs via single-pulse TMS. These findings indicate that paired-pulse TMS probing SICF1, SICF2, and single-pulse TMS engage overlapping but spatially distinct cortical circuits, adding further insights into the intricate organization of the human motor hand area.

">Decision Confidence and Outcome Variability Optimally Regulate Separate Aspects of Hyperparameter Setting</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement learning models describe how agents learn about the world (value learning), and how they interact with their environment based on the learned information (decision policy). As in any optimization problem, it is important to set the process hyperparameters, a process which also is thought to be learned (meta-learning). Here, we test a key prediction of meta-learning frameworks, namely that there exist one or more meta-signals that govern hyperparameter setting. Specifically, we test whether decision confidence, in a context of varying outcome variability, informs hyperparameter setting. Participants performed a 2-armed bandit task with confidence ratings. Model comparison shows that confidence and outcome variability are differentially involved in hyperparameter setting. A high level of confidence in the previous choice decreased hyperparameter setting of decision noise on the current trial: when a trial was made with low confidence, the choice on the next trial tended to be more explorative (i.e. high decision noise). Outcome variability influenced another hyperparameter, the learning rate for positive prediction errors (thus affecting value learning). Both strategies are rational approaches that maximize earnings at different temporal loci: the modulation by confidence causes more frequent exploration early after a change point, the modulation by outcome variability is advantageous late after a change point. Finally, we show that (reported) confidence in value-based choices reflects the action value of the chosen option (irrespective of the unchosen value). In sum, decision confidence and outcome variability reflect distinct signals that optimally guide the setting of hyperparameters in decision policy and value learning, respectively.

">Unraveling Integration-Segregation Imbalances in Schizophrenia Through Topological High-Order Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: The occurrence of brain disorders correlates with detectable dysfunctions in the specialization of brain connectomics. While extensive research has explored this relationship, there remains a lack of studies specifically examining the statistical correlation between psychotic brain networks using high-order networks, considering the limitations of low-order networks. Moreover, these dysfunctions are believed to be linked to information imbalances in brain functions. However, our understanding of how these imbalances give rise to specific psychotic symptoms remains limited. Methods: This study aims to address this gap by investigating variations at the topological high-order level of the system with regard to specialization in both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Employing graph-theoretic brain network analysis, we systematically examine resting-state functional MRI data to delineate system-level distinctions in the connectivity patterns of brain networks. Results: The findings indicate that topological high-order functional connectomics highlight differences in the connectome between healthy controls and schizophrenia, demonstrating increased cingulo-opercular task control and salience interactions, while the interaction between subcortical and default mode networks, dorsal attention and sensory/somatomotor mouth decreases in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the segregation of brain systems in healthy controls compared to individuals with schizophrenia, which means the balance between segregation and integration of brain networks is disrupted in schizophrenia, suggesting that restoring this balance may aid in the treatment of the disorder. Additionally, the increased segregation and decreased integration of brain systems in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls may serve as a novel indicator for early schizophrenia diagnosis. Conclusions: We discovered that topological high-order functional connectivity highlights brain network interactions compared to low-order functional connectivity. Furthermore, we observed alterations in specific brain regions associated with schizophrenia, as well as changes in brain network information integration and segregation in individuals with schizophrenia.

">Differential effects of conventional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) of the cerebellum on offset analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Background : Endogenous analgesic systems in the brain modulate pain perception. Offset analgesia (OA) describes the large decrease in perceived pain in response to a minor decrease in applied painful thermal stimulus. Here non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) of the cerebellum is used to probe OA. Methods : An OA protocol individualized to heat pain threshold (HPT) was applied via TSA-II (Medoc, Israel). Heat was ramped to HPT, with a transient temperature increase of HPT+1{degrees}C. NIBS interventions were applied prior to OA in 46 participants within a sham controlled repeated measures design. Cathodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-definition (4X1) transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) were applied in separate experimental sessions to examine whether diffuse (tDCS) or focal (HD-tDCS) stimulation differentially modulates OA. Results : OA induced hypoanalgesia was robust, with 90% of responses showing a substantial drop in perceived pain ({delta}VAS) following the 1{degrees}C fall in temperature, with an average VAS decrease of 38 in response to the 1{degrees}C fall in temperature. Cathodal cerebellar HD-tDCS enhances the analgesic impact of OA on four OA parameters (OA latency, VAS minimum, VAS mean and VAS 2nd max) relative to pre-stimulation. Conventional tDCS modulates two OA metrics relative to pre-stimulation (OA duration, VAS 2nd max) with an increase in OA duration following sham tDCS. Conclusion : There is a differential influence of conventional and high-definition cerebellar NIBS on OA. This is suggestive of cerebellar modulation of OA and highlights the importance of electrode montage in delineating the influence of the cerebellum in pain processing.

	<p>Background: Moral evaluation is identified as the first stage in the theory of moral judgment, and academics believe that it may align with the social intuitionist model. This study aims to prove that the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional dominance hypothesis applies to moral evaluation by presenting a computational decision-making model that mathematically formalizes this emotional dominance decision-making process. We also compared different types of valence evaluation tasks to test the emotional priority hypothesis. Methods: We used a convenience sampling method to randomly recruit 30 enrolled college students. The drift-diffusion model was employed to analyze reaction times for words with various emotional and moral valences Additionally, we designed different valence evaluation tasks based on the response relevance hypothesis and evaluated the processing order through reaction time comparisons. Results: The analysis revealed that the emotional mechanism of immoral evaluation differs from moral evaluation. An increase in emotional valence accelerates the speed of evidence accumulation (v) for moral evaluation (M = 1.21, 0.2% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 99.8%) but lowers decision caution (a) in immoral evaluation (M = &amp;amp;minus;0.64, 96.1% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 3.9%). In contrast, moral valence does not have a significant influence on evaluation processes (v, M = &amp;amp;minus;0.28, 72.1% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 27.9%; a, M = &amp;amp;minus;0.32, 79.3% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 20.7%). Furthermore, We found no significant difference in reaction times between moral and immoral words in the emotional evaluation task (F(1,29) = 0.55, p = 0.464, partial &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.02), but a significant difference existed in the moral evaluation task (F(1,29) = 17.99, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, partial &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.38), indicating that the tendency of relatively fast immoral evaluation in emotional evaluation tasks may be caused by emotional priority. Conclusions: Our findings support the intuitive model&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional dominance hypothesis and introduce a new emotional mechanism into moral evaluation. This study clarifies the distinct emotional processes in moral and immoral evaluations, fills a gap in the research on moral evaluation, and offers insights into human decision-making in moral contexts.</p>

                <p>Despite decades of preclinical investigation, there remains limited understanding of the etiology and biological underpinnings of anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to potential threat is characteristic of anxiety-like behavior in humans and rodents, but traditional rodent behavioral tasks aimed to assess threat responsiveness lack translational value, especially with regard to emotionally valenced stimuli. Therefore, development of novel preclinical approaches to serve as analogues to patient assessments is needed. In humans, the fearful face task is widely used to test responsiveness to socially communicated threat signals. In rats, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are analogous social cues associated with positive or negative affective states that can elicit behavioral changes in the receiver. It is therefore likely that when rats hear aversive alarm call USVs (22&nbsp;kHz), they evoke translatable changes in brain activity comparable with the fearful face task. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female rats to assess changes in BOLD activity induced by exposure to aversive 22&nbsp;kHz alarm calls emitted in response to threatening stimuli, prosocial (55&nbsp;kHz) USVs emitted in response to appetitive stimuli, or a computer-generated 22&nbsp;kHz tone. Results show patterns of regional activation that are specific to each USV stimulus. Notably, limbic regions clinically relevant to psychiatric disorders (e.g., amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) are preferentially activated by either aversive 22&nbsp;kHz or appetitive 55&nbsp;kHz USVs. These results support the use of USV playback as a promising translational tool to investigate affective processing under conditions of distal threat in preclinical rat models.</p>

                <p>Human and mouse dorsal root ganglia (hDRG and mDRG) neurons are important tools in understanding the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie nociception and drive pain behaviors. One of the simplest differences in firing phenotypes is that neurons are single-firing (exhibit only one action potential) or multi-firing (exhibit 2 or more action potentials). To determine if single- and multi-firing hDRG neurons exhibit differences in intrinsic properties, firing phenotypes, and AP waveform properties, and if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing, we measured 22 electrophysiological properties by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of 94 hDRG neurons from six male and four female donors. We then analyzed the data using several machine learning models to determine if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing. We used 1,000 iterations of Monte Carlo cross-validation to split the data into different train and test sets and tested the logistic regression, <I>k</I>-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector classifier, and XGBoost machine learning models. All models tested had a &gt;80% accuracy on average, with support vector classifier, and XGBoost performing the best. We found that several properties correlated with multi-firing hDRG neurons and together could be used to predict multi-firing neurons in hDRG including a long decay time, a low rheobase, and long first spike latency. We also found that the hDRG models were able to predict multi-firing with 90% accuracy in mDRG neurons. Understanding these properties could be beneficial in the elucidation of targets on peripheral sensory neurons related to pain.</p>

                This case report presents a case of infected corneal laceration with traumatic endophthalmitis in a pediatric patient. A boy in his middle childhood sustained an ocular injury with scissors, resulting in a full-thickness corneal laceration and infection. Despite the delay in seeking treatment, the patient underwent successful surgical interventions, including corneal scraping, pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy, and secondary intraocular lens implantation (IOL). The infection was managed with targeted antibiotics, and Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed as the causative organism. Remarkably, these efforts led to a satisfactory improvement in the patient’s vision to 20/50. This case underscores the importance of early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach in the management of pediatric ocular trauma to optimize outcomes.

                Background This study investigated the determinants of community preventive behavior in complying with the Indonesian regulations to prevent COVID-19 local transmission. Methods A cross-sectional study used to collect the data via an online cross using a form created from a google questionnaire forms. A total of 1,802 respondents were gathered at a single point in time. The authors used the Health Belief Model (HBM) approach to measure and create a model for the prevention of local transmission of COVID-19. Results This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (16%) and severity (43%). There were only 3% respondents with perceived barriers and 19% with strong self-efficacy. The findings showed that self-efficacy and perceived barriers had statistically significant relationships with preventive behavior (p-value <0.05). The goodness of fit index showed that the proposed model was not fit for the data (RMSE<0.080, GFI>0.950, AGFI>0.950, SRMR<0.100), which means that it was not fit to describe the empirical phenomenon under study. Conclusions This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (84%) and severity (67%), but more than half had high perceived benefits (54%). Only a few respondents had significant barriers to implementing COVID-19 transmission prevention behaviours (3%). Still, most respondents had low perceived self-efficacy (81%), and only 60% had good behaviours related to COVID-19 prevention. In the context of COVID-19 preventive behaviour, we recommended to improve perceived susceptibility and severity by providing the correct information (which contain information about how people susceptible to the virus and the impact of infected by the virus) with the local cultural context.

                Abstract* Background A positive exercise stress test (EST) is common among pilots, and it may indicate a greater risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to determine the incidence of recurrently positive EST and their predictors among civilian pilots in Indonesia. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study among civilian pilots who had the first positive EST test between January 2019 and June 2020 at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta. The data were retrieved from medical records. Subjects were included if there were data on subsequent ESTs at 6 and 12 months. Risk factors included total flight hours (TFH) in the last 6 months, license type, aircraft cabin pressurization system, flying limitation such as multicrew, cardiac intervention, age, smoking habit, family history of coronary artery disease, body mass index, blood pressure levels, lipid profile, and fasting blood glucose. Results Eighty-seven pilots were included; 54 of them (62.1%) had recurrent positive ESTs. All subjects were men, and the median age was 51 (range 40-64) years. Independent predictors of recurrent positive ESTs were age 60-65 years (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.12–23.16, p= 0.035), a TFH of > 275 hours (ORadj 5.1, 95% CI: 1.28–20.65, p= 0.021), and dyslipidemia (ORadj: 4.2 95% CI: 1.468–12.275, p=0.015). Having these three risk factors increased the probability of a recurrent positive EST up to 100%. Conclusion The incidence of recurrently positive ESTs among civilian pilots in Indonesia was high. Airlines may want to implement a more aggressive health policy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases among their pilots.

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral quadriceps tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO. Data extraction and blind selection were performed, and a consensus was reached among experts in case of conflicts. Results We identified 220 studies, 31 meeting the inclusion criteria post-screening. The Functional Independence Measure was the most used assessment (96.8%), followed by grip strength (32.3%) and the 10-m walk test (9.7%). Other assessments included the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set, Short Physical Performance Battery, and Timed Up and Go Test. Although fall-related incidents are frequent, significantly affecting patient outcomes in rehabilitation units, balance assessments were underutilized. Conclusions Although the FIM is an extensively used assessment in rehabilitation wards, balance assessments critical for fall prevention are significantly underused. Therefore, these assessment tools should be evaluated in future research and clinical practice.

                Background The cestode Hymenolepis diminuta is a cosmopolitan parasite, which in the adult stage is usually found in the small intestine of rats and accidentally in humans. Case report We describe the finding of eggs of this parasite in an asymptomatic 3-year-old child. The child had extremely high IgE values of 1,376 IU/ml. After receiving treatment with Albendazole suspension 400mg/20mL, on the 10th day post-treatment, he showed no H. diminuta eggs in his fecal matter Conclusions Detailed morphological review of Hymenolepis nana-like eggs is recommended to distinguish them from H. diminuta eggs.

We can visually discriminate and recognize a wide range of materials. Meanwhile, we use language to describe what we see and communicate relevant information about the materials. Here, we investigate the relationship between visual judgment and language expression to understand how visual features relate to semantic representations in human cognition. We use deep generative models to generate images of realistic materials. Interpolating between the generative models enables us to systematically create material appearances in both well-defined and ambiguous categories. Using these stimuli, we compared the representations of materials from two behavioral tasks: visual material similarity judgments and free-form verbal descriptions. Our findings reveal a moderate but significant correlation between vision and language on a categorical level. However, analyzing the representations with an unsupervised alignment method, we discover structural differences that arise at the image-to-image level, especially among ambiguous materials morphed between known categories. Moreover, visual judgments exhibit more individual differences compared to verbal descriptions. Our results show that while verbal descriptions capture material qualities on the coarse level, they may not fully convey the visual nuances of material appearances. Analyzing the image representation of materials obtained from various pre-trained deep neural networks, we find that similarity structures in human visual judgments align more closely with those of the vision-language models than purely vision-based models. Our work illustrates the need to consider the vision-language relationship in building a comprehensive model for material perception. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the alignment and misalignment between representations from different modalities, leveraging information from human behaviors and computational models.

                <p>by Fuyin Yang, Hao Zhu, Xinyi Cao, Hui Li, Xinyu Fang, Lingfang Yu, Siqi Li, Zenan Wu, Chunbo Li, Chen Zhang, Xing Tian</p>

Distinguishing reality from hallucinations requires efficient monitoring of agency. It has been hypothesized that a copy of motor signals, termed <i>efference copy (EC)</i> or <i>corollary discharge (CD)</i>, suppresses sensory responses to yield a sense of agency; impairment of the inhibitory function leads to hallucinations. However, how can the sole absence of inhibition yield positive symptoms of hallucinations? We hypothesize that selective impairments in functionally distinct signals of <i>CD</i> and <i>EC</i> during motor-to-sensory transformation cause the positive symptoms of hallucinations. In an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment with a delayed articulation paradigm in schizophrenic patients with (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucinations (non-AVHs), we found that preparing to speak without knowing the contents (general preparation) did not suppress auditory responses in both patient groups, suggesting the absent of inhibitory function of <i>CD</i>. Whereas, preparing to speak a syllable (specific preparation) enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable in non-AVHs, whereas AVHs showed enhancement in responses to unprepared syllables, opposite to the observations in the normal population, suggesting that the enhancement function of <i>EC</i> is not precise in AVHs. A computational model with a virtual lesion of an inhibitory inter-neuron and disproportional sensitization of auditory cortices fitted the empirical data and further quantified the distinct impairments in motor-to-sensory transformation in AVHs. These results suggest that “broken” <i>CD</i> plus “noisy” <i>EC</i> causes erroneous monitoring of the imprecise generation of internal auditory representation and yields auditory hallucinations. Specific impairments in functional granularity of motor-to-sensory transformation mediate positivity symptoms of agency abnormality in mental disorders.

                <p>by Suresha G. Prabhu, Vineeta N. Pillai, Lizna Mohamed Ali, Valérie Vivet-Boudou, Akhil Chameettachal, Serena Bernacchi, Farah Mustafa, Roland Marquet, Tahir A. Rizvi</p>

The packaging of genomic RNA (gRNA) into retroviral particles relies on the specific recognition by the Gag precursor of packaging signals (<i>Psi</i>), which maintain a complex secondary structure through long-range interactions (LRIs). However, it remains unclear whether the binding of Gag to <i>Psi</i> alone is enough to promote RNA packaging and what role LRIs play in this process. Using mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), we investigated the effects of mutations in 4 proposed LRIs on gRNA structure and function. Our findings revealed the presence of an unsuspected extended LRI, and hSHAPE revealed that maintaining a wild-type–like <i>Psi</i> structure is crucial for efficient packaging. Surprisingly, filter-binding assays demonstrated that most mutants, regardless of their packaging capability, exhibited significant binding to Pr77<sup>Gag</sup>, suggesting that Gag binding to <i>Psi</i> is insufficient for efficient packaging. Footprinting experiments indicated that efficient RNA packaging is promoted when Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> binds to 2 specific sites within <i>Psi</i>, whereas binding elsewhere in <i>Psi</i> does not lead to efficient packaging. Taken together, our results suggest that the 3D structure of the <i>Ps</i>i/Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> complex regulates the assembly of viral particles around gRNA, enabling effective discrimination against other viral and cellular RNAs that may also bind Gag efficiently.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                Background Despite the success of titanium (Ti) implants in dental rehabilitation, emerging evidence implicates the release of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) from the implant surface as a potential contributor to the initiation of the pathogenic process leading to peri-implantitis and ultimately failure of the implants. However, a comprehensive investigation to elucidate the dose-dependent effects of TiO2NPs on cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses is lacking. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of TiO2NPs on the cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine expression in Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGFs). Methods HGFs were isolated from gingival tissue samples obtained from periodontally and systemically healthy subjects. Ti standard solution for ICP was diluted to create concentrations of (0.001 ppm, 0.01 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 1 ppm, 10 ppm, and 100 ppm) for cell culture media containing titanium. HGFs were then cultured in these varying concentrations for specific time periods (days 1, 3, 5, and 7) to assess cell viability. A cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the levels and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β) using qRT-PCR and ELISA techniques. Results Our findings demonstrate a concentration and duration-dependent decrease in HGF viability upon exposure to titanium nanoparticles. Notably, a 50% reduction in cell viability was observed at the highest concentration (100 ppm). qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and IL-6, in HGFs exposed to titanium. Interestingly, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, and TGF-β) remained comparable or even equivalent compared to controls across different titanium concentrations. Conclusions The study revealed a concentration and duration-dependent influence on HGF viability and cytokine profile, suggesting potential cytotoxicity and modulation of the inflammatory response mediated by TiO2NPs. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and their implications for dental implant biocompatibility.

                Background Dental caries is a common chronic oral disease, posing a serious public health issue. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning shows potential in addressing this problem. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore emerging topics, collaborations, key authors, and research trends in Southeast Asia related to the application of machine learning in dental caries management. Methods A comprehensive selection using the Scopus database to obtain relevant research, covering publications from inception to July 2024 was done. We employed the Bibliometric approaches, including co-authorship networks, yearly publishing trends, institutional and national partnerships, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and citation analysis, for the collected data. To explore the visualization and network analysis, we employed the tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix in R package. Results The final bibliometric analysis included 246 papers. We found that Malaysia became the top contributor with 59 publications, followed by Indonesia (37) and Thailand (29). Malaysia had the highest Multiple Country Publications (MCP) ratio at 0.407. Top institutions including the Universiti Sains Malaysia led with 39 articles, followed by Chiang Mai University (36) and the National University of Singapore (30) became the leader. Co-authorship analysis using VOSviewer revealed six distinct clusters. A total of 1220 scholars contributed to these publications. The top 10 keywords, including ‘human’ and ‘dental caries,’ indicated research hotspots. Conclusion We found growing evidence of machine learning applications to address dental caries in Southeast Asia. The bibliometric analysis highlights key authors, collaborative networks, and emerging topics, revealing research trends since 2014. This study underscores the importance of bibliometric analysis in tackling this public health issue.

                Here, Schmid et al. develop a series of NTRK fusion-driven GEMMs of pediatric-type glioma. Treatment with TRK kinase inhibitors significantly prolongs survival, but tumors eventually recur due to treatment-resistant persister cells. These tumors upregulate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, and MEK inhibition by itself leads to a significant growth inhibition.

                Poschel et al. observed that loss of host PD-L1 function leads to increased inflammation-driven colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, loss of PD-L1 expands the PD-1+Nrp1loTGFβ+ Treg to recruit IL6+ neutrophils to inhibit CTL activation. PD-L1 therefore functions as a suppressor of inflammation-driven colorectal tumor via restraining PD-1+Nrp1loTGFβ+ Treg cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91598">Peptidoglycan-tethered and free forms of the Braun lipoprotein are in dynamic equilibrium in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Peptidoglycan (PG) is a giant macromolecule that completely surrounds bacterial cells and prevents lysis in hypo-osmotic environments. This net-like macromolecule is made of glycan strands linked to each other by two types of transpeptidases that form either 4→3 (PBPs) or 3→3 (LDTs) cross-links. Previously, we devised a heavy isotope-based PG full labeling method coupled to mass spectrometry to determine the mode of insertion of new subunits into the expanding PG network (Atze et al., 2022). We showed that PG polymerization operates according to different modes for the formation of the septum and of the lateral cell walls, as well as for bacterial growth in the presence or absence of β-lactams in engineered strains that can exclusively rely on LDTs for PG cross-linking when drugs are present. Here, we apply our method to the resolution of the kinetics of the reactions leading to the covalent tethering of the Braun lipoprotein (Lpp) to PG and the subsequent hydrolysis of that same covalent link. We find that Lpp and disaccharide-peptide subunits are independently incorporated into the expanding lateral cell walls. Newly synthesized septum PG appears to contain small amounts of tethered Lpp. LDTs did mediate intense shuffling of Lpp between PG stems leading to a dynamic equilibrium between the PG-tethered and free forms of Lpp.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96943">Pectin methylesterase activity is required for RALF1 peptide signalling output</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular ligands largely remains to be explored. Rapid alkalinisation factors (RALFs) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we address a crucial connection between the de-methylesterification machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with pectin methyl esterases (PMEs) abolishes RALF1-induced root growth repression. Our data suggest that positively charged RALF1 peptides bind negatively charged, de-methylesterified pectin with high avidity. We illustrate that the RALF1 association with de-methylesterified pectin is required for its FERONIA-dependent perception, contributing to the control of the extracellular matrix and the regulation of plasma membrane dynamics. Notably, this mode of action is independent of the FER-dependent extracellular matrix sensing mechanism provided by FER interaction with the leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins. We propose that the methylation status of pectin acts as a contextualizing signalling scaffold for RALF peptides, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to peptide hormone-mediated responses.

                Identification of unique essential bacterial genes is important for not only the understanding of their cell biology but also the development of new antimicrobials. Here, we report a previously unrecognized core component of the <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> divisome. Our results reveal that the protein, termed Aeg1 interacts with multiple cell division proteins, including FtsN, which is required for components of the divisome to localize to the midcell. We demonstrate that the FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> and FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> mutants effectively bypassed the need of Aeg1 by <i>A. baumannii</i>, as did the activation variants FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>. Our results suggest that Aeg1 is a cell division protein that arrives at the division site to initiate cell division by recruiting FtsN, which activates FtsQLB and FtsA to induce the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. The discovery of the new essential cell division protein has provided a new target for the development of antibacterial agents.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93666">Novel risk loci for COVID-19 hospitalization among admixed American populations</a></h4>

              
                The genetic basis of severe COVID-19 has been thoroughly studied, and many genetic risk factors shared between populations have been identified. However, reduced sample sizes from non-European groups have limited the discovery of population-specific common risk loci. In this second study nested in the SCOURGE consortium, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Americans, comprising a total of 4702 hospitalized cases recruited by SCOURGE and seven other participating studies in the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. We identified four genome-wide significant associations, two of which constitute novel loci and were first discovered in Latin American populations (<i>BAZ2B</i> and <i>DDIAS</i>). A trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed another novel cross-population risk locus in <i>CREBBP</i>. Finally, we assessed the performance of a cross-ancestry polygenic risk score in the SCOURGE admixed American cohort. This study constitutes the largest GWAS for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Latin Americans conducted to date. This allowed to reveal novel risk loci and emphasize the need of considering the diversity of populations in genomic research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95185">Evaluation of Gremlin-1 as a therapeutic target in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis</a></h4>

              
                Gremlin-1 has been implicated in liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) via inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling and has thereby been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Using rat in vivo and human in vitro and ex vivo model systems of MASH fibrosis, we show that neutralisation of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis. Still, Gremlin-1 was upregulated in human and rat MASH fibrosis, but expression was restricted to a small subpopulation of COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. Lentiviral overexpression of Gremlin-1 in LX-2 cells and primary hepatic stellate cells led to changes in BMP-related gene expression, which did not translate to increased fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we show that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin with high affinity, which prevents Gremlin-1 from entering systemic circulation, prohibiting Gremlin-1-mediated organ crosstalk. Overall, our findings suggest a redundant role for Gremlin-1 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, which is unamenable to therapeutic targeting.

                γ-Secretase plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system. Our recent development of genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors has enabled the spatiotemporal recording of γ-secretase activity on a cell-by-cell basis in live neurons <i>in culture</i>. Nevertheless, how γ-secretase activity is regulated <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Here, we employ the near-infrared (NIR) C99 720–670 biosensor and NIR confocal microscopy to quantitatively record γ-secretase activity in individual neurons in living mouse brains. Intriguingly, we uncovered that γ-secretase activity may influence the activity of γ-secretase in neighboring neurons, suggesting a potential ‘cell non-autonomous’ regulation of γ-secretase in mouse brains. Given that γ-secretase plays critical roles in important biological events and various diseases, our new assay <i>in vivo</i> would become a new platform that enables dissecting the essential roles of γ-secretase in normal health and diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93975">An in vitro approach reveals molecular mechanisms underlying endocrine disruptor-induced epimutagenesis</a></h4>

              
                Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenol S (BPS) are xenobiotic compounds that can disrupt endocrine signaling due to steric similarities to endogenous hormones. EDCs have been shown to induce disruptions in normal epigenetic programming (epimutations) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that predispose disease states. Most interestingly, the prevalence of epimutations following exposure to many EDCs persists over multiple generations. Many studies have described direct and prolonged effects of EDC exposure in animal models, but many questions remain about molecular mechanisms by which EDC-induced epimutations are introduced or subsequently propagated, whether there are cell type-specific susceptibilities to the same EDC, and whether this correlates with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors. We exposed cultured pluripotent (iPS), somatic (Sertoli and granulosa), and primordial germ cell-like (PGCLC) cells to BPS and found that differential incidences of BPS-induced epimutations and DEGs correlated with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors inducing epimutations near relevant hormone response elements in somatic and pluripotent, but not germ cell types. Most interestingly, we found that when iPS cells were exposed to BPS and then induced to differentiate into PGCLCs, the prevalence of epimutations and DEGs was largely retained, however, &gt;90% of the specific epimutations and DEGs were replaced by novel epimutations and DEGs. These results suggest a unique mechanism by which an EDC-induced epimutated state may be propagated transgenerationally.

">Cell-type specific projection patterns promote balanced activity in cortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Brain structure provides the stage on which activity unfolds. Models linking connectivity to dynamics have relied on probabilistic estimates of connectivity derived from paired electrophysiological recordings or single-neuron morphologies obtained by light microscopy (LM) studies. Only recently have electron microscopy (EM) data sets been processed and made available for volumes of cortex on the cubic millimeter scale, thereby exposing the actual connectivity of neurons. Here, we construct a population-based, layer-resolved connectivity map from EM data, taking into account the spatial scale of local cortical connectivity. We compare the obtained connectivity with a map based on an established LM data set. Simulating spiking neural networks constrained by the derived microcircuit architectures shows that both models allow for biologically plausible ongoing activity when synaptic currents caused by neurons outside the network model are adjusted for every population independently. However, differentially varying the external current onto excitatory and inhibitory populations uncovers that only the EM-based model robustly shows plausible dynamics. Our work confirms the long-standing hypothesis that a preference of excitatory neurons for inhibitory targets, not present in the LM-based model, promotes balanced activity in the cortical microcircuit.

">Reliable sensory processing of superficial cortical interneurons is modulated by behavioral state</a></h4>

              
                The GABAergic interneurons within cortical layer 1 (L1) integrate sensory and top-down inputs to modulate network activity and induce the plasticity underlying learning. However, little is known about how sensory inputs drive L1 interneuron activity. We used two-photon calcium imaging to measure the sound-evoked responses of two L1 interneuron populations expressing VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) or NDNF (neuron-derived neurotrophic factor) in mouse auditory cortex. We find that L1 interneurons respond to both simple and complex sounds with high trial-to-trial variability. However, these interneurons respond reliably to just a narrow range of stimuli, reflecting selectivity to spectrotemporal sound features. This response reliability is modulated by behavioral state and predicted by the activity of neighboring interneurons. Our data reveal that L1 interneurons exhibit sensory tuning and identify the modulation of response reliability as a potential mechanism by which L1 relays state-dependent cues to shape sensory representations.

">Interpersonal Synchronization in Mother-Child Dyads: Neural and Motor Coupling as a Mechanism for Motor Learning and Development in Preschoolers</a></h4>

              
                Interpersonal movement synchrony (IMS) and brain-to-brain coupling play a crucial role in social behavior across species. In humans, IMS is often studied in structured tasks that require specific body movements, while spontaneous, unstructured movements have received less attention. In this study, we investigated both structured and spontaneous motor coordination in mother-child dyads. We recorded upper-body kinematics and dual-EEG from mothers and their preschool children during motor tasks and spontaneous face-to-face interactions. Our findings show that mother-child dyads synchronize their movements and neural activity, particularly in gamma band oscillations. This motor and neural synchrony evolves across task repetitions, with a strong correlation between motor and neural measures. Further, we observed that only motor synchronization was significantly related to the child's motor development stage, as assessed by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. These results suggest that gamma band brain-to-brain coupling reflects joint motor coordination and mutual adaptation shaped by structured tasks and spontaneous interpersonal interactions.

">Semantic Dimensions Support the Cortical Representation of Object Memorability</a></h4>

              
                Recent work in vision sciences contends that objects carry an intrinsic property, memorability, that describes the likelihood that an object can be successfully encoded and later retrieved from memory. It has been shown that object memorability is supported by semantic information, but the neural correlates involved are largely unexplored. The present study explores these premises and asks whether neural correlates of object memorability can be accounted for by semantic dimensions. To investigate these questions, we combine three datasets: (1) feature norms for a database of ~1000 natural object images, (2) normative conceptual and perceptual memory data for those objects, and (3) neuroimaging data from an fMRI study collected using a subset (n=360) of those objects. We found that object-wise memorability elicits consistent brain activation across participants in key mnemonic regions (e.g., hippocampus and rhinal cortex), and that a substantial portion of the variance in this brain activity is mediated by the semantic factors describing these images. Regions with the strongest mediation effects are associated with sensory, motor, and visual processes, suggesting that the relationship between memorability and semantics may align with a sensory-functional account of the representation of concepts in the brain.

">Guided Visual Search is associated with a feature-based priority map in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual search models have long emphasised that task-relevant items must be prioritised for optimal performance. While it is known that search efficiency also benefits from active distractor inhibition, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are debated. Here, we used MEG in combination with Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) to probe how neuronal excitability in early visual cortex is modulated during feature-guided visual search. Participants were instructed to indicate the presence or absence of a letter "T" presented amongst 16 and 32 "L"s. In the guided search condition, participants were informed about the colour of the "T" and could infer the colour of the irrelevant distractors. In the unguided search condition, the target colour was unknown. We found that guided search was associated with enhanced RIFT responses to the target colour, and decreased responses to the distractor colour compared to unguided search. These results conceptually replicated using both a conventional coherence approach, as well as with a General Linear Model approach based on a single-trial measure of the RIFT response. The present findings expand on previous reports based on electrophysiology and fMRI in humans and non-human primates by revealing that feature-guidance in visual search affects neuronal excitability as early as primary visual cortex.

">Examining Relationships between Functional and Structural Brain Network Architecture, Age, and Attention Skills in Early Childhood</a></h4>

              
                Early childhood is a critical period showing experience-dependent changes in brain structure and function. The complex link between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain is of particular interest, however, its relationship with both age and attention in early childhood is not well understood. In this study, children between the ages of 4 and 7, and at a one-year follow-up visit, underwent neuroimaging (diffusion-weighted and passive-viewing functional magnetic resonance imaging) and assessments for selective, sustained, and executive attention. We examined regional graph theory metrics and SC-FC coupling of the structural and functional networks. Partial least squares (PLS) was used to investigate longitudinal brain measure changes and cross-sectional associations with age and attention. We observed longitudinal changes in functional graph theory metrics and age-related decreases in SC modularity. Region-wise graph theory analyses revealed variable brain-behaviour relationships across the brain, highlighting regions where structural topology is linked to age and attentional performance. Furthermore, we identified SC as a dominant predictor of age when compared to FC and SC-FC coupling. The findings emphasise how early childhood is a dynamic period where cognitive functioning is intricately and predominantly linked to structural network features.

">Limiting hearing loss in transgenic mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Transgenic mice provide unprecedented access to manipulate and visualize neural circuits, however, those on a C57BL/6 background develop progressive hearing loss, significantly confounding systems-level and behavioral analysis. While outbreeding can limit hearing loss, it introduces strain variability and complicates the generation of complex genotypes. Here, we propose an approach to preserve hearing by crossing transgenic mice with congenic B6.CAST-Cdh23Ahl+ mice, which maintain low-threshold hearing into adulthood. Widefield and two-photon imaging of the auditory cortex revealed that 2.5-month-old C57BL/6 mice exhibit elevated thresholds to high frequency tones and widespread cortical reorganization, with most neurons responding best to lower frequencies. In contrast, Ahl+ C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust neural responses across a range of frequencies and sound levels (4-64 kHz, 30-90 dB SPL) and retained low thresholds into adulthood. Our approach offers a cost-effective solution for generating complex genotypes and facilitates more interpretable systems neuroscience research by eliminating confounding effects from hearing loss.

">Out of the single-neuron straitjacket: neurons within assemblies change selectivity and their reconfiguration underlies dynamic coding</a></h4>

              
                We investigated cell assemblies in the frontal cortex of macaques during two discrimination tasks. Focusing on the period of goal-action transformation, we extracted spikes fired during assembly activation from the full neural activity and showed that the contribution of a neuron to assembly coding, when it coordinates with other assembly neurons, differs from its coding in isolation. Neurons with their flexible participation to multiple assemblies contributed to the encoding of new information not encoded by the neurons alone. Even non-discriminative neurons acquired selectivity as part of the collective activity of the assemblies. Thus, neurons in their assemblies process distinct information for various purposes as a chess simul master, playing on multiple chessboards. The reconfiguration of the participation of the neurons into different assemblies in the goal-action transformation process translated into a dynamic form of coding, whereas minimal reconfiguration was associated with the static goal coding of the memory period.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigated the behavior of postural adjustments throughout the entire action: from the preparatory phase (anticipatory postural adjustment, APA), the focal movement phase (online postural adjustments, OPA), to the compensatory phase (compensatory postural adjustment, CPA) while raising the arms in a standing position, both with eyes opened and closed. The goal was to analyze the effects of reduced sensorial information and different heights on postural muscle activity during these three phases. Methods: Eight young women performed rapid shoulder flexion while standing on the ground and on a 1-m elevated platform. The EMG activity of the trunk and lower limb muscles was recorded during all three phases. Results: Although average muscle activity was similar on the ground and the elevated platform, the pattern of postural muscle activation varied across the motor action. During OPA, all postural muscle activity was the highest, while it was the lowest during APA. On the elevated platform postural muscles have increased their activation during APA. In the most stable condition (standing on the ground with eyes opened), muscle activity showed a negative correlation between APA and OPA, but there was no correlation between OPA and CPA. Conclusions: Our results suggest postural control adapts to sensory, motor, and cognitive conditions. Therefore, the increased demand for postural control due to the height of the support base demands greater flexibility in postural synergies and alters muscle activity.</p>

                <p>Executive control of movement enables inhibiting impulsive responses critical for successful navigation of the environment. Circuits mediating stop commands involve prefrontal and basal ganglia structures with fMRI evidence demonstrating increased activity during response inhibition in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)&mdash;often ascribed to maintaining task attentional demands. Using direct intraoperative cortical recordings in male and female human subjects, we investigated oscillatory dynamics along the rostral-caudal axis of dlPFC during a modified Go/No-go task, probing components of both proactive and reactive motor control. We assessed whether cognitive control is topographically organized along this axis and observed that low-frequency power increased prominently in mid-rostral dlPFC when inhibiting and delaying responses. These findings provide evidence for a key role for mid-rostral dlPFC low-frequency oscillations in sculpting motor control.</p>

                <p>The surprising omission or reduction of vital resources (food, fluid, social partners) can induce an aversive emotion known as frustrative nonreward (FNR), which can influence subsequent behavior and physiology. FNR is an integral mediator of irritability/aggression, motivation (substance use disorders, depression), anxiety/fear/threat, learning/conditioning, and social behavior. Despite substantial progress in the study of FNR during the twentieth century, research lagged in the later part of the century and into the early twenty-first century until the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative included FNR and loss as components of the negative valence domain. This led to a renaissance of new research and paradigms relevant to basic and clinical science alike. The COVID-19 pandemic's extensive individual and social restrictions were correlated with increased drug and alcohol use, social conflict, irritability, and suicide, all potential consequences of FNR. This article highlights animal models related to these psychiatric disorders and symptoms and presents recent advances in identifying the brain regions and neurotransmitters implicated.</p>

                <p>Emotionally salient experiences are encoded and remembered more strongly, an effect that can be amplified by hormones like cortisol. Such memories can in turn profoundly influence later behavior. However, little is known about the link between amplified salience encoding and subsequent behavior. This pathway may be particularly important for risky alcohol drinking, which has been linked to sensitized salience responses, memory, and cortisol. To test this possibility, we integrated pharmacology using a double-blind cross-over design with fMRI, cognitive, and motivation assays across a range of healthy male and female social drinkers. As anticipated, cortisol enhanced memory for salient alcohol-related events; critically, this bias was in turn associated with later alcohol motivation. Increased alcohol motivation was particularly pronounced in more susceptible risky drinkers, for whom cortisol enhanced brain salience responses to alcohol. These sensitized salience responses predicted both memory biases and alcohol motivation. Together, these findings reveal maladaptive consequences of enhanced salience encoding.</p>

                <p>The brain is a highly adaptable organ that is molded by experience throughout life. Although the field of neuroscience has historically focused on intrinsic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity, there is growing evidence that multiple glial populations regulate the timing and extent of neuronal plasticity, particularly over the course of development. This review highlights recent discoveries on the role of glial cells in the establishment of cortical circuits and the regulation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity during critical periods of neurodevelopment. These studies provide strong evidence that neuronal circuit maturation and plasticity are non-cell autonomous processes that require both glial&ndash;neuronal and glial&ndash;glial cross talk to proceed. We conclude by discussing open questions that will continue to guide research in this nascent field.</p>

                <p>Primates, as social beings, have evolved complex brain mechanisms to navigate intricate social environments. This review explores the neural bases of body perception in both human and nonhuman primates, emphasizing the processing of social signals conveyed by body postures, movements, and interactions. Early studies identified selective neural responses to body stimuli in macaques, particularly within and ventral to the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These regions, known as body patches, represent visual features that are present in bodies but do not appear to be semantic body detectors. They provide information about posture and viewpoint of the body. Recent research using dynamic stimuli has expanded the understanding of the body-selective network, highlighting its complexity and the interplay between static and dynamic processing. In humans, body-selective areas such as the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA) have been implicated in the perception of bodies and their interactions. Moreover, studies on social interactions reveal that regions in the human STS are also tuned to the perception of dyadic interactions, suggesting a specialized social lateral pathway. Computational work developed models of body recognition and social interaction, providing insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Despite advances, significant gaps remain in understanding the neural mechanisms of body perception and social interaction. Overall, this review underscores the importance of integrating findings across species to comprehensively understand the neural foundations of body perception and the interaction between computational modeling and neural recording.</p>

                <p>Palmitoylation, a lipid-based posttranslational protein modification, plays a crucial role in regulating various aspects of neuronal function through altering protein membrane-targeting, stabilities, and protein&ndash;protein interaction profiles. Disruption of palmitoylation has recently garnered attention as disease mechanism in neurodegeneration. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and associated neuronal dysfunction, including but not limited to amyloid precursor protein, &beta;-secretase (BACE1), postsynaptic density protein 95, Fyn, synaptotagmin-11, mutant huntingtin, and mutant superoxide dismutase 1, undergo palmitoylation, and recent evidence suggests that altered palmitoylation contributes to the pathological characteristics of these proteins and associated disruption of cellular processes. In addition, dysfunction of enzymes that catalyze palmitoylation and depalmitoylation has been connected to the development of neurological disorders. This review highlights some of the latest advances in our understanding of palmitoylation regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and explores potential therapeutic implications.</p>

                <p>The traditional view of glial cells as mere supportive tissue has shifted, due to advances in technology and theoretical conceptualization, to include a diversity of other functions, such as regulation of complex behaviors. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), have been shown to modulate synaptic functions through gliotransmitter-mediated neurotransmitter reuptake, influencing neuronal signaling and behavioral functions. Contemporary studies further highlight astrocytes&rsquo; involvement in complex cognitive functions. For instance, inhibiting astrocytes in the hippocampus can lead to memory deficits, suggesting their integral role in memory processes. Moreover, astrocytic calcium activity and astrocyte&ndash;neuron metabolic coupling have been linked to changes in synaptic strength and learning. Microglia, another type of glial cell, also extend beyond their supportive roles, contributing to learning and memory processes, with microglial reductions impacting these functions in a developmentally dependent manner. Oligodendrocytes, traditionally thought to have limited roles postdevelopment, are now recognized for their activity-dependent modulation of myelination and plasticity, thus influencing behavioral responses. Recent advancements in technology and computational modeling have expanded our understanding of glial functions, particularly how astrocytes influence neuronal circuits and behaviors. This review underscores the importance of glial cells in CNS functions and the need for further research to unravel the complexities of neuron&ndash;glia interactions, the impact of these interactions on brain functions, and potential implications for neurological diseases.</p>

                <p>The motor cortex is essential for controlling the flexible movements underlying complex behaviors. Behavioral flexibility involves the ability to integrate and refine new movements, thereby expanding an animal's repertoire. This review discusses recent strides in motor learning mechanisms across spatial and temporal scales, describing how neural networks are remodeled at the level of synapses, cell types, and circuits and across time as animals' learn new skills. It highlights how changes at each scale contribute to the evolving structure and function of neural circuits that accompanies the expansion and refinement of motor skills. We review new findings highlighted by advanced imaging techniques that have opened new vistas in optical physiology and neuroanatomy, revealing the complexity and adaptability of motor cortical circuits, crucial for learning and control. At the structural level, we explore the dynamic regulation of dendritic spines mediating corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs to the motor cortex. We delve into the role of perisynaptic astrocyte processes in maintaining synaptic stability during learning. We also examine the functional diversity among pyramidal neuron subtypes, their dendritic computations and unique contributions to single cell and network function. Further, we highlight how cortical activation is characterized by increased consistency and reduced strength as new movements are learned and how external inputs contribute to these changes. Finally, we consider the motor cortex's necessity as movements unfold over long time scales. These insights will continue to drive new research directions, enhancing our understanding of motor cortical circuit transformations that underpin behavioral changes expressed throughout an animal's life.</p>

                <p>When exposed to rhythmic stimulation, the human brain displays rhythmic activity across sensory modalities and regions. Given the ubiquity of this phenomenon, how sensory rhythms are transformed into neural rhythms remains surprisingly inconclusive. An influential model posits that endogenous oscillations entrain to external rhythms, thereby encoding environmental dynamics and shaping perception. However, research on neural entrainment faces multiple challenges, from ambiguous definitions to methodological difficulties when endogenous oscillations need to be identified and disentangled from other stimulus-related mechanisms that can lead to similar phase-locked responses. Yet, recent years have seen novel approaches to overcome these challenges, including computational modeling, insights from dynamical systems theory, sophisticated stimulus designs, and study of neuropsychological impairments. This review outlines key challenges in neural entrainment research, delineates state-of-the-art approaches, and integrates findings from human and animal neurophysiology to provide a broad perspective on the usefulness, validity, and constraints of oscillatory models in brain&ndash;environment interaction.</p>

                <p>Hormonal contraceptives (HCs) are one of the most highly prescribed classes of drugs in the world used for both contraceptive and noncontraceptive purposes. Despite their prevalent use, the impact of HCs on the brain remains inadequately explored. This review synthesizes recent findings on the neuroscience of HCs, with a focus on human structural neuroimaging as well as translational, nonhuman animal studies investigating the cellular, molecular, and behavioral effects of HCs. Additionally, we consider data linking HCs to mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress response as a potential mediator. The review also addresses the unique sensitivity of the adolescent brain to HCs, noting significant changes in brain structure and function when HCs are used during this developmental period. Finally, we discuss potential effects of HCs in combination with smoking-derived nicotine on outcomes of ischemic brain damage. Methodological challenges, such as the variability in HC formulations and user-specific factors, are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for precise and individualized research approaches. Overall, this review underscores the necessity for continued interdisciplinary research to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of HCs, aiming to optimize their use and improve women's health.</p>

                <p>Understanding the brain requires studying its multiscale interactions from molecules to networks. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets detailing brain circuit composition, connectivity, and activity is transforming neuroscience. However, integrating and interpreting this data remains challenging. Concurrently, advances in supercomputing and sophisticated modeling tools now enable the development of highly detailed, large-scale biophysical circuit models. These mechanistic multiscale models offer a method to systematically integrate experimental data, facilitating investigations into brain structure, function, and disease. This review, based on a Society for Neuroscience 2024 MiniSymposium, aims to disseminate recent advances in large-scale mechanistic modeling to the broader community. It highlights (1) examples of current models for various brain regions developed through experimental data integration; (2) their predictive capabilities regarding cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying experimental recordings (e.g., membrane voltage, spikes, local-field potential, electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) and brain function; and (3) their use in simulating biomarkers for brain diseases like epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's, aiding in understanding their biophysical underpinnings and developing novel treatments. The review showcases state-of-the-art models covering hippocampus, somatosensory, visual, motor, auditory cortical, and thalamic circuits across species. These models predict neural activity at multiple scales and provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying sensation, motor behavior, brain signals, neural coding, disease, pharmacological interventions, and neural stimulation. Collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and clinicians is essential for the development and validation of these models, particularly as datasets grow. Hence, this review aims to foster interest in detailed brain circuit models, leading to cross-disciplinary collaborations that accelerate brain research.</p>

                <p>Somatosensory neuroprostheses restore, replace, or enhance tactile and proprioceptive feedback for people with sensory impairments due to neurological disorders or injury. Somatosensory neuroprostheses typically couple sensor inputs from a wearable device, prosthesis, robotic device, or virtual reality system with electrical stimulation applied to the somatosensory nervous system via noninvasive or implanted interfaces. While prior research has mainly focused on technology development and proof-of-concept studies, recent acceleration of clinical studies in this area demonstrates the translational potential of somatosensory neuroprosthetic systems. In this review, we provide an overview of neurostimulation approaches currently undergoing human testing and summarize recent clinical findings on the perceptual, functional, and psychological impact of somatosensory neuroprostheses. We also cover current work toward the development of advanced stimulation paradigms to produce more natural and informative sensory feedback. Finally, we provide our perspective on the remaining challenges that need to be addressed prior to translation of somatosensory neuroprostheses.</p>

Despite decades of research, the development and function of motor circuits remain poorly understood. Breakthroughs in the field recently provided new tools and tractable model systems that set the stage to discover the molecular mechanisms and circuit logic underlying motor control. Here, we describe recent advances from both vertebrate (mouse, frog) and invertebrate (nematode, fruit fly) systems on cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable motor circuits to develop and function and highlight conserved and divergent mechanisms necessary for motor circuit development.</p>

                <p>Neuromodulators act on multiple timescales to affect neuronal activity and behavior. They function as synaptic fine-tuners and master coordinators of neuronal activity across distant brain regions and body organs. While much research on neuromodulation has focused on roles in promoting features of wakefulness and transitions between sleep and wake states, the precise dynamics and functions of neuromodulatory signaling during sleep have received less attention. This review discusses research presented at our minisymposium at the 2024 Society for Neuroscience meeting, highlighting how norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine orchestrate brain oscillatory activity, control sleep architecture and microarchitecture, regulate responsiveness to sensory stimuli, and facilitate memory consolidation. The potential of each neuromodulator to influence neuronal activity is shaped by the state of the synaptic milieu, which in turn is influenced by the organismal or systemic state. Investigating the effects of neuromodulator release across different sleep substates and synaptic environments offers unique opportunities to deepen our understanding of neuromodulation and explore the distinct computational opportunities that arise during sleep. Moreover, since alterations in neuromodulatory signaling and sleep are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders and because existing pharmacological treatments affect neuromodulatory signaling, gaining a deeper understanding of the less-studied aspects of neuromodulators during sleep is of high importance.</p>

                <p>Most studies on the development of the visual system have focused on the mechanisms shaping early visual stages up to the level of primary visual cortex (V1). Much less is known about the development of the stages after V1 that handle the higher visual functions fundamental to everyday life. The standard model for the maturation of these areas is that it occurs sequentially, according to the positions of areas in the adult hierarchy. Yet, the existing literature reviewed here paints a different picture, one in which the adult configuration emerges through a sequence of unique network configurations that are not mere partial versions of the adult hierarchy. In addition to studying higher visual development per se to fill major gaps in knowledge, it will be crucial to adopt a network-level perspective in future investigations to unravel normal developmental mechanisms, identify vulnerabilities to developmental disorders, and eventually devise treatments for these disorders.</p>

In neuroscience, degeneracy can be seen in the constellation of biophysical properties that produce a neuron's characteristic intrinsic properties and/or the constellation of mechanisms that determine circuit outputs or behavior. Here, we present examples of degeneracy at multiple levels of organization, from single-cell behavior, small circuits, large circuits, and, in cognition, drawing conclusions from work ranging from bacteria to human cognition. Degeneracy allows the individual-to-individual variability within a population that creates potential for evolution.</p>

                <p>The development of the visual system is a complex and multistep process characterized by the precise wiring of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals with their corresponding neurons in the visual nuclei of the brain. Upon reaching primary image-forming nuclei (IFN), such as the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, RGC axons undergo extensive arborization that refines over the first few postnatal weeks. The molecular mechanisms driving this activity-dependent remodeling process, which is influenced by waves of spontaneous activity in the developing retina, are still not well understood. In this study, by manipulating the activity of RGCs in mice from either sex and analyzing their transcriptomic profiles before eye-opening, we identified the Type I membrane protein synaptotagmin 13 (Syt13) as involved in spontaneous activity-dependent remodeling. Using these mice, we also explored the impact of spontaneous retinal activity on the development of other RGC recipient targets such as nonimage-forming (NIF) nuclei and demonstrated that proper frequency and duration of retinal waves occurring prior to visual experience are essential for shaping the connectivity of the NIF circuit. Together, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms governing activity-dependent axon refinement during the assembly of the visual circuit.</p>

                <p>The human brain exhibits both oscillatory and aperiodic, or 1/<I>f</I>, activity. Although a large body of research has focused on the relationship between brain rhythms and sensory processes, aperiodic activity has often been overlooked as functionally irrelevant. Prompted by recent findings linking aperiodic activity to the balance between neural excitation and inhibition, we investigated its effects on the temporal resolution of perception. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from participants (both sexes) during the resting state and a task in which they detected the presence of two flashes separated by variable interstimulus intervals. Two-flash discrimination accuracy typically follows a sigmoid function whose steepness reflects perceptual variability or inconsistent integration/segregation of the stimuli. We found that individual differences in the steepness of the psychometric function correlated with EEG aperiodic exponents over posterior scalp sites. In other words, participants with flatter EEG spectra (i.e., greater neural excitation) exhibited increased sensory noise, resulting in shallower psychometric curves. Our finding suggests that aperiodic EEG is linked to sensory integration processes usually attributed to the rhythmic inhibition of neural oscillations. Overall, this correspondence between aperiodic neural excitation and behavioral measures of sensory noise provides a more comprehensive explanation of the relationship between brain activity and sensory integration and represents an important extension to theories of how the brain samples sensory input over time.</p>

                <p>by Ruipeng Wei, Masahiro Hitomi, Tammy Sadler, Lamis Yehia, Daniela Calvetti, Jacob Scott, Charis Eng</p>

Persons with germline variants in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog, <i>PTEN</i>, are molecularly diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). PHTS confers high risks of specific malignancies, and up to 23% of the patients are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or developmental delay (DD). The accurate prediction of these two seemingly disparate phenotypes (cancer <i>vs</i>. ASD/DD) for PHTS at the individual level remains elusive despite the available statistical prevalence of specific phenotypes of the syndrome at the population level. The pleiotropy of the syndrome may, in part, be due to the alterations of the key multi-functions of PTEN. Maintenance of genome integrity is one of the key biological functions of PTEN, but no integrative studies have been conducted to quantify the DNA damage response (DDR) in individuals with PHTS and to relate to phenotypes and genotypes. In this study, we used 43 PHTS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to investigate the associations between DDR and <i>PTEN</i> genotypes and/or clinical phenotypes ASD/DD <i>vs</i>. cancer. The dynamics of DDR of γ-irradiated LCLs were analyzed using the exponential decay mathematical model to fit temporal changes in γH2AX levels which report the degree of DNA damage. We found that <i>PTEN</i> nonsense variants are associated with less efficient DNA damage repair ability resulting in higher DNA damage levels at 24 hours after irradiation compared to <i>PTEN</i> missense variants. Regarding PHTS phenotypes, LCLs from PHTS individuals with ASD/DD showed faster DNA damage repairing rate than those from patients without ASD/DD or cancer. We also applied the reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) mathematical model, a tumor cell growth model with a DNA damage term, to accurately describe the DDR process in the LCLs. For each LCL, we can derive parameters of the PDE. Then we averaged the numerical results by PHTS phenotypes. By performing simple subtraction of two subgroup average results, we found that PHTS-ASD/DD is associated with higher live cell density at lower DNA damage level but lower cell density level at higher DNA damage level compared to LCLs from individuals with PHTS-cancer and PHTS-neither.

                <p>by Jan Lause, Philipp Berens, Dmitry Kobak</p>

A recent paper claimed that <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell datasets are “specious” and fail to capture true biological structure. The authors argued that such embeddings are as arbitrary and as misleading as forcing the data into an elephant shape. Here we show that this conclusion was based on inadequate and limited metrics of embedding quality. More appropriate metrics quantifying neighborhood and class preservation reveal the elephant in the room: while <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell data do not preserve high-dimensional distances, they can nevertheless provide biologically relevant information.

                Background Conventional antifungal therapies, including topical applications, are effective against oral candidiasis but have limitations such as resistance development and cytotoxicity especially for immunocompromised patients. Phytotherapy presents a promising alternative, offering potential solutions to these challenges. However, despite numerous clinical trials, there is a lack of standardized protocols for phytotherapeutic applications. This systematic review protocol seeks to evaluate the potential of phytotherapy as an alternative treatment for oral candidiasis and compare its efficacy with standard antifungal therapies. Protocol This protocol aims to assess the effectiveness of phytotherapy compared to standard antifungal treatments for oral candidiasis. Initially, controlled descriptors in MeSH terms (e.g., “Candidiasis, Oral,” “Phytotherapy”) and keywords were selected from MEDLINE and combined using Boolean operators (‘AND’, ‘OR’) to create a comprehensive search strategy. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two independent reviewers to select studies that meet the inclusion criteria. The quality and risk of bias of the selected studies will be assessed afterward. Data will be gathered using standardized tools and subsequently synthesized for analysis. Discrepancies between reviewers will be settled through discussion, or, if required, by involving a third reviewer. Discussion Results obtained from this systematic review will describe various natural compounds like essential oils, herbal extracts, and bioactive plant ingredients that exhibit antifungal properties used against oral candidiasis and will evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to standard antifungal treatments.

                Background The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in electrocardiographic (ECG) devices has become a pivotal area of research, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. These technologies are essential for enhancing cardiac diagnosis and monitoring. Methods This study assesses current trends, key contributors, and collaborative networks in the field of AI-enhanced ECG devices. We utilized a comprehensive analysis, using the Biblioshiny library from Bibliometrix for data exploration of data extracted from the Scopus database and VOSViewer for creating and visualizing maps. These tools were played an important role in conducting an in-depth analysis of the relationships and developments within the field. Results The analysis shows a significant increase in publications related to AI-enhanced ECG devices, with a marked surge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the growing interest and technological advancements, the study exposes a notable disparity in the geographical distribution of research contributions, highlighting substantial under-representation of African researchers. This gap is attributed to infrastructural, financial constraints, and limited collaborative networks within the continent. Conclusion The rapid evolution and increasing importance of AI in ECG devices underscore the need for more inclusive research practices. There is a critical need to integrate and promote contributions from under-represented regions, particularly Africa, to ensure a globally diverse perspective in tackling health challenges. This study calls for enhanced participation and support for African researchers to bridge the existing research gap and foster global health equity.

                Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of death in men worldwide. The treatment of PCa depends on the clinical stage of the disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and histology. Lycopene is a bright red carotenoid found in tomatoes, which enhances apoptosis in prostate cells, but its effectiveness has not been studied in East African countries. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of lycopene from tomato extracts in reducing PSA levels, disease progression, and apoptosis in the prostate glands of men with PCa in Tanzania. Methods This study will be a randomized phase III clinical trial of men diagnosed with PCa in Tanzania. In total, 400 men will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention (n=200) and control (n=200) and followed for 12 months. The intervention arm will receive tomato paste for daily use in addition to the standard treatment, whereas the control arm will only follow the standard of care. The primary endpoints will be a reduction in PSA levels, improved clinical status, and apoptosis of the prostate gland. Data analysis was performed based on the intention-to-treat principle. Descriptive statistics were used to compare average lycopene and PSA levels in the intervention group using T-test and Chi-squared tests. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to further assess the effect of lycopene on PCa progression, urinary symptoms, and PSA reduction. All statistical tests were two-sided at an alpha level of <0.05. Discussion The study used a food supplement as a drug/intervention with minimal or no adverse reactions. However, there is a fear that the control group may not adhere to the protocol after learning the benefits of tomato paste. The study findings will promote the consumption of tomato paste in males diagnosed with PCa to improve the clinical status and reduce disease progression. Trial registration The study has been registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry with registration No PACTR202405488763956.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features adhesions caused by estrogen-dependent periodic bleeding. It is characterised by a widely spread fibrotic interstitium that comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibres, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis found outside the uterus. Thus, fibrosis is recognized as a critical component because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or non-cyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root cause, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, makes it challenging to diagnose early and to implement therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Research on understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still ongoing to find biomarkers and develop non-hormonal therapeutic approaches. Current clinical research indicates a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is thought to be tightly linked to pain, a major factor for the decline in the patient’s quality of life but little is known about the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways that lead to endometriosis-related fibrosis. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease to assess treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article’s goal is to examine recent developments in the field and pinpoint knowledge gaps that exist with a focus on the development of novel fibrotic mouse models for the early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and how this knowledge aids in the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments which opens fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.
