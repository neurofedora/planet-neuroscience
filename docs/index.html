                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Spain’s first Nobel laureate neuroscientist recognized as the founding father of modern neuroscience, is to be preserved in a new museum in Madrid: the National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN), one of the most important scientific research institutes in the country sciences in the scope of natural sciences of the Spanish National Research Council. For a boy who dreamed of being an artist but started his career apprenticed to first a barber and then a cobbler, Santiago Ramón y Cajal made a distinguished mark in science. One of Cajal’s most important contributions to our understanding of the brain was his discovery of the direction of the information flow within neurons and in neural circuits, which he called the “dynamic polarization law,” without a doubt the founding principle of neurosciences. The exposition planned by the MNCN is a perfect occasion to show the academy and, it is hoped, the general public at large the beautiful organization of the nervous system as first acknowledged by modern science. With the highly motivated organizers of this well-planned initiative, neuroscientists at the Cajal Institute are confident that this sample of the Cajal legacy will also be taken as an esthetic experience for those who approach it for the first time. It might be that science and art often go together.

                arXiv:2501.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Biological networks, such as the brain, are known to exhibit group structure at a variety of scales -- local, meso, and global scale. Modularity, while useful in describing mesoscale brain organization, is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure. This approach, while valuable, overlooks important localized variations in community structure at the node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity ($nQ$) captures both meso and local scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that $nQ$ illuminates granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored $nQ$ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. Observed changes in $nQ$ in fMRI and DTI networks aligned with known trajectories of AD and were linked to common biomarkers of the disease, including amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Additionally, $nQ$ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters showing indications that $nQ$ may be a useful diagnostic tool for characterizing disease stages. Our findings demonstrate the utility of $nQ$ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into temporal and disease related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, $nQ$ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.

                arXiv:2501.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares three evolutionary algorithms for the problem of fog service placement: weighted sum genetic algorithm (WSGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). A model for the problem domain (fog architecture and fog applications) and for the optimization (objective functions and solutions) is presented. Our main concerns are related to optimize the network latency, the service spread and the use of the resources. The algorithms are evaluated with a random Barabasi-Albert network topology with 100 devices and with two experiment sizes of 100 and 200 application services. The results showed that NSGA-II obtained the highest optimizations of the objectives and the highest diversity of the solution space. On the contrary, MOEA/D was better to reduce the execution times. The WSGA algorithm did not show any benefit with regard to the other two algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09976">Dendritic Localized Learning: Toward Biologically Plausible Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation is the foundational algorithm for training neural networks and a key driver of deep learning's success. However, its biological plausibility has been challenged due to three primary limitations: weight symmetry, reliance on global error signals, and the dual-phase nature of training, as highlighted by the existing literature. Although various alternative learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, most either fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously or yield suboptimal results. Inspired by the dynamics and plasticity of pyramidal neurons, we propose Dendritic Localized Learning (DLL), a novel learning algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that DLL satisfies all three criteria of biological plausibility while achieving state-of-the-art performance among algorithms that meet these requirements. Furthermore, DLL exhibits strong generalization across a range of architectures, including MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs. These results, benchmarked against existing biologically plausible learning algorithms, offer valuable empirical insights for future research. We hope this study can inspire the development of new biologically plausible algorithms for training multilayer networks and advancing progress in both neuroscience and machine learning.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of reducing the power consumption of the OLSR routing protocol in vehicular networks. Nowadays, energy-aware and green communication protocols are important research topics, specially when deploying wireless mobile networks. This article introduces a fast automatic methodology to search for energy-efficient OLSR configurations by using a parallel evolutionary algorithm. The experimental analysis demonstrates that significant improvements over the standard configuration can be attained in terms of power consumption, with no noteworthy loss in the QoS.

                arXiv:2501.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicles to exchange warning messages with each other. These specific kinds of networks help reduce hazardous traffic situations and improve safety, which are two of the main objectives in developing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For this, the performance of VANETs should guarantee the delivery of messages in a required time. An obstacle to this is that the data traffic generated may cause network congestion. Data congestion control is used to enhance network capabilities, increasing the reliability of the VANET by decreasing packet losses and communication delays. In this study, we propose a swarm intelligence based distributed congestion control strategy to maintain the channel usage level under the threshold of network malfunction, while keeping the quality-of-service of the VANET high. An exhaustive experimentation shows that the proposed strategy improves the throughput of the network, the channel usage, and the stability of the communications in comparison with other competing congestion control strategies.

Abstract: This article describes the application of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for locating roadside infrastructure for vehicular communication networks over realistic urban areas. A multiobjective formulation of the problem is introduced, considering quality-of-service and cost objectives. The experimental analysis is performed over a real map of M\'alaga, using real traffic information and antennas, and scenarios that model different combinations of traffic patterns and applications (text/audio/video) in the communications. The proposed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm computes accurate trade-off solutions, significantly improving over state-of-the-art algorithms previously applied to the problem.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10243">Random-Key Algorithms for Optimizing Integrated Operating Room Scheduling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient surgery room scheduling is essential for hospital efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel concept of Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), rigorously tested on literature and new, real-world inspired instances. Our combinatorial optimization problem incorporates multi-room scheduling, equipment scheduling, and complex availability constraints for rooms, patients, and surgeons, facilitating rescheduling and enhancing operational flexibility. The RKO approach represents solutions as points in a continuous space, which are then mapped in the problem solution space via a deterministic function known as a decoder. The core idea is to operate metaheuristics and heuristics in the random-key space, unaware of the original solution space. We design the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with $Q$-Learning, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search for use within an RKO framework, employing a single decoder function. The proposed metaheuristics are complemented by lower-bound formulations, providing optimal gaps for evaluating the effectiveness of the heuristic results. Our results demonstrate significant lower and upper bounds improvements for the literature instances, notably proving one optimal result. Furthermore, the best-proposed metaheuristic efficiently generates schedules for the newly introduced instances, even in highly constrained scenarios. This research offers valuable insights and practical solutions for improving surgery scheduling processes, offering tangible benefits to hospitals by optimising resource allocation, reducing patient wait times, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10173">Optimal Restart Strategies for Parameter-dependent Optimization Algorithms</a></h4>

Abstract: This paper examines restart strategies for algorithms whose successful termination depends on an unknown parameter $\lambda$. After each restart, $\lambda$ is increased, until the algorithm terminates successfully. It is assumed that there is a unique, unknown, optimal value for $\lambda$. For the algorithm to run successfully, this value must be reached or surpassed. The key question is whether there exists an optimal strategy for selecting $\lambda$ after each restart taking into account that the computational costs (runtime) increases with $\lambda$. In this work, potential restart strategies are classified into parameter-dependent strategy types. A loss function is introduced to quantify the wasted computational cost relative to the optimal strategy. A crucial requirement for any efficient restart strategy is that its loss, relative to the optimal $\lambda$, remains bounded. To this end, upper and lower bounds of the loss are derived. Using these bounds it will be shown that not all strategy types are bounded. However, for a particular strategy type, where $\lambda$ is increased multiplicatively by a constant factor $\lambda$, the relative loss function is bounded. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that within this strategy type, there exists an optimal value for $\lambda$ that minimizes the maximum relative loss. In the asymptotic limit, this optimal choice of $\lambda$ does not depend on the unknown optimal $\lambda$.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel bionic intelligent optimisation algorithm, Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO) algorithm, which is inspired by the neural structure of octopus, especially its hierarchical and decentralised interaction properties. By simulating the sensory, decision-making, and executive abilities of octopuses, the OIO algorithm adopts a multi-level hierarchical strategy, including tentacles, suckers, individuals and groups, to achieve an effective combination of global and local search. This hierarchical design not only enhances the flexibility and efficiency of the algorithm, but also significantly improves its search efficiency and adaptability. In performance evaluations, including comparisons with existing mainstream intelligent optimisation algorithms, OIO shows faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially when dealing with multimodal functions and high-dimensional optimisation problems. This advantage is even more pronounced as the required minimum accuracy is higher, with the OIO algorithm showing an average speedup of 2.27 times that of conventional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and 9.63 times that of differential evolution (DE) on multimodal functions. In particular, when dealing with high-dimensional optimisation problems, OIO achieves an average speed of 10.39 times that of DE, demonstrating its superior computational efficiency. In addition, the OIO algorithm also shows a reduction of about 5\% in CPU usage efficiency compared to PSO, which is reflected in the efficiency of CPU resource usage also shows its efficiency. These features make the OIO algorithm show great potential in complex optimisation problems, and it is especially suitable for application scenarios that require fast, efficient and robust optimisation methods, such as robot path planning, supply chain management optimisation, and energy system management.

">Targeted Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment Rescues Developmental Alterations in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neurological disease caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, characterized by early onset and degeneration of lower motor neurons. Understanding early neurodevelopmental defects in SMA is crucial for optimizing therapeutic interventions. Using spinal cord and cerebral organoids generated from multiple SMA type I donors, we revealed widespread disease mechanisms beyond motor neuron degeneration. Single-cell transcriptomics uncovered pervasive alterations across neural populations, from progenitors to neurons, demonstrating SMN-dependent dysregulation of neuronal differentiation programs. Multi-electrode array analysis identified consistent hyperexcitability in both spinal and brain organoids, establishing altered electrical properties as a central nervous system-wide feature of pathogenesis. Early administration of an optimized antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that restored SMN levels rescued morphological and functional deficits in spinal cord organoids across different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, this early intervention precisely corrected aberrant splicing in newly identified SMN1 targets enriched at critical nodes of neuronal differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that early developmental defects are core features of SMA pathogenesis that can be prevented by timely therapeutic intervention, providing new insights for optimizing treatment strategies.

">7-ketocholesterol contributes to microglia-driven increases in astrocyte reactive oxygen species in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease. Within this context, cholesterol undergoes oxidation, producing the pro-inflammatory product 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In this study, we observe elevated levels of 7-KC in the brains of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. To further understand the contribution of 7-KC on the oxidative environment, we developed a method to express a genetically encoded fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor in astrocytes, the primary source of cholesterol in the brain. With this sensor, we discovered that 7-KC increases H2O2 levels in astrocytes in vivo, but not when directly applied to astrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, when 7-KC was applied to a microglia cell line alone or mixed astrocyte and microglia cultures, it resulted in microglia activation and increased oxidative stress in astrocytes. Depletion of microglia from 3xTg mice resulted in reduced 7-KC in the brains of these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 7-KC, acting through microglia, contributes to increased astrocyte oxidative stress in AD. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between cholesterol oxidation, microglia activation, and astrocyte oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD.

">NAc-DBS selectively enhances memory updating without effect on retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a widely used therapeutic option when pharmacological treatments prove ineffective or refractory for psychiatric patients. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) represents a frequently targeted site in DBS interventions due to its demonstrated safety profile and therapeutic efficacy in obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression, and anorexia nervosa. However, limited mechanistic understanding hampers its broader clinical applicability. This study sought to delineate the distinct behavioural dimensions modulated by NAc-DBS, its impact on distinct facets of memory, and to elucidate the underlying brain-network mechanism of action. We developed a novel spatial navigation task for rats and employed a high-dimensional behavioural analysis complemented by fMRI to dissect the cognitive, behavioural and neurobiological effects of NAc-DBS. Active NAc-DBS produced a selective enhancement of long-term memory encoding without affecting memory recall or working memory. We found no effect of NAc-DBS on motor, appetitive or stress-related behaviours. Sustained neuronal activation in the NAc, septum, entorhinal and insular cortex demonstrated no desensitization to chronic NAc-DBS, which triggered a functional reorganization among dopaminergic-related structures. These findings suggest that NAc-DBS induces a functional reorganization in the mesocorticolimbic system, potentially mimicking a dopaminergic novelty signal to enhance memory updating. This provides a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic use of NAc-DBS, particularly in improving cognitive flexibility in psychiatric disorders.

">Reciprocal interaction between cortical SST and PV interneurons in regulating top-down retinothalamic refinement</a></h4>

              
                Refinement of thalamic circuits is crucial for the proper maturation of sensory circuits. In the visual system, this process is regulated by corticothalamic feedback during the experience-dependent phase of development. Yet the cortical circuits modulating this feedback remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate opposing roles for cortical somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in shaping retinogeniculate connectivity during the thalamic sensitive period (P20-30). Early in the refinement process, SST interneurons promote the strengthening and pruning of retinal inputs in the thalamus, as evidenced by disrupted synaptic refinement following their ablation. In contrast, PV interneurons, which mature later, act as a brake on this refinement, with their ablation leading to enhanced pruning of retinogeniculate connections. Notably, manipulating the relative balance between these inhibitory circuits can regulate sensory deprivation-induced retinogeniculate remodeling. Taken together, our findings show that cortical SST and PV interneuron circuits drive reciprocal antagonism that gate experience-dependent feedforward thalamic refinement.

">Decreased KCC2 expression in the human spinal dorsal horn associated with chronic pain and long-term opioid use</a></h4>

              
                Loss of GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory efficacy in the spinal dorsal horn is associated with neuropathic pain and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in rodent models. Downregulation of the KCC2 chloride extrusion transporter is a key mechanism underlying this decreased inhibitory efficacy, but to-date there is no evidence supporting or opposing this hypothesis in humans. Here we demonstrate that KCC2 expression is decreased in superficial dorsal horn neurons of organ donors who died with a documented history of pain, or of long-term opioid use. We show profoundly decreased KCC2 dorsal horn membrane expression in a primary cohort associated with either chronic pain or opioid use, and in a replication cohort of mixed chronic pain and opioid use history. These results show that decreased dorsal horn inhibitory efficacy likely promotes chronic pain in humans and support the development of therapeutics augmenting KCC2 function as a treatment for chronic pain and opioid use disorders.

">Persistent interferon signaling that causes sensory neuron plasticity and pain in arthritis</a></h4>

              
                While the inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis have been described, mechanisms driving pain are poorly defined. Here, we used a multitude of approaches to uncover the neural basis, mediators, intracellular signaling pathway and the mechanism of inflammatory pain. In cartilage autoantibody-induced arthritis mice, an early immune-activation and a cytokine storm were mainly driven by vascular cells and monocyte/macrophages in the dorsal root ganglion. However, persistently elevated interferons and receptor-activation of the MNK1/2-eIF4E signaling pathway at all disease phases caused sensory-motor dysfunction and pain by inducing hyperexcitability and sensitization of Gfra3+ sensory neurons. Like mice, human sensory neurons expressed interferon receptors and interferons were elevated only in individuals with painful rheumatoid arthritis. Signaling pathway inhibition in vivo reversed pain and restored limb function. The finding that joint pain before and during arthritis is caused by a defined cytokine and signaling pathway holds promise for targeted therapies for pain relief in arthritis.

">Integrative Gene Co-expression Network Analysis Reveals Protein-Coding and lncRNA Genes Associated with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving widespread molecular disruptions, many of which remain poorly understood. While AD pathology progresses through distinct brain regions, it is unclear whether these regions are similarly affected. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in cellular processes, but their roles in AD remain largely unexplored. A comprehensive analysis of the complex molecular interactions underlying AD, particularly the roles of lncRNAs in their interactions with protein-coding genes and the comparison of networks across brain regions, could offer valuable insights into the disease's progression and underlying mechanisms. Method: To address this, we applied consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis using a meta-analytic approach to 396 postmortem brain RNA-seq samples to explore AD pathophysiology mechanisms. Results: Our study revealed significant network rewiring in AD, with pronounced alterations in the temporal cortex compared to the frontal cortex. While the temporal cortex showed adaptive changes in gene interactions, the frontal cortex exhibited a loss of healthy correlations, potentially reflecting different levels of disease progression. We identified key players in the temporal cortex AD network, including 46 protein-coding genes and 27 lncRNAs. Using the established functions of protein-coding genes as anchors, we provided functional annotations for over 100 lncRNAs across two brain regions, identifying potential lncRNAs involved in AD pathology and highlighting their roles in both healthy and diseased states. Conclusion: We provided novel insights into the molecular interactions underlying AD and introduced new candidate protein-coding and lncRNA genes for further experimental validation and therapeutic exploration.

">Takens' theorem to assess EEG traces: regional variations in brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Takens' theorem (TT) proves that the behaviour of a dynamical system can be effectively reconstructed within a multidimensional phase space. This offers a comprehensive framework for examining temporal dependencies, dimensional complexity and predictability of time series data. We applied TT to investigate the physiological regional differences in EEG brain dynamics of healthy subjects, focusing on three key channels: FP1 (frontal region), C3 (sensorimotor region), and O1 (occipital region). We provided a detailed reconstruction of phase spaces for each EEG channel using time-delay embedding. The reconstructed trajectories were quantified through measures of trajectory spread and average distance, offering insights into the temporal structure of brain activity that traditional linear methods struggle to capture. Variability and complexity were found to differ across the three regions, revealing notable regional variations. FP1 trajectories exhibited broader spreads, reflecting the dynamic complexity of frontal brain activity associated with higher cognitive functions. C3, involved in sensorimotor integration, displayed moderate variability, reflecting its functional role in coordinating sensory inputs and motor outputs. O1, responsible for visual processing, showed constrained and stable trajectories, consistent with repetitive and structured visual dynamics. These findings align with the functional specialization of different cortical areas, suggesting that the frontal, sensorimotor and occipital regions operate with autonomous temporal structures and nonlinear properties. This distinction may have significant implications for advancing our understanding of normal brain function and enhancing the development of brain-computer interfaces. In sum, we demonstrated the utility of TT in revealing regional variations in EEG traces, underscoring the value of nonlinear dynamics.

">Elaborating the connections of a closed-loop forebrain circuit in the rat: Circumscribed evidence for novel topography within a cortico-striato-pallidal triple descending projection, with thalamic feedback, to the anterior lateral hypothalamic area</a></h4>

              
                Motivated behaviors are regulated by distributed forebrain networks. Traditional approaches have often focused on individual brain regions and connections that do not capture the topographic organization of forebrain connectivity. We performed co-injections of anterograde and retrograde tract tracers in rats to provide novel high-spatial resolution evidence of topographic connections that elaborate a previously identified closed-loop forebrain circuit implicated in affective and motivational processes. The nodes of this circuit include select regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (defined here more specifically as the cingulate region, CNG), a dorsomedial portion of the nucleus accumbens (ACBdm), a portion of the medial substantia innominata (SIm), and the anterior lateral hypothalamic area (LHAa). The circuit also reportedly receives a feedback loop from the anterior region of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVTa). In this draft report, we provide detailed circumscribed evidence supporting these regions as interconnected nodes, and provide several novel findings concerning the topographic organization of their projections. First, we identified the ACBdm based on its unique connectivity. Anterograde labeling from anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVTa) and retrograde labeling from medial substantia innominata (SIm) and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) were restricted to the dorsomedial ACB (ACBdm). Strikingly, this labeling formed a longitudinal column extending along virtually the entire anteroposterior axis of ACBdm. Subsequent analysis revealed a convergence of ACBdm axon terminals and retrogradely labeled neurons from LHA within the anterior SIm. Furthermore, we identified cortical CNG regions related to this circuit. These regions contained retrograde labeling from both ACBdm and LHA, and anterograde labeling from PVTa. These cortical subdomains included regions previously implicated in the circuit but for which detailed organization has been unknown: (1) a region between the posterior prelimbic and infralimbic areas; (2) posterior part of basolateral and basomedial amygdalar nuclei, and (3) anterior pole of ventral subiculum. Our circumscribed findings, which await additional samples and analysis, support the existence of a topographically organized closed-loop circuit and identify two additional novel features: (1) direct evidence for an elaborate core rostrocaudal topography for a cortico-striato-pallidal motif comprising a triple descending projection to the LHA via direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways, and (2) a thalamic feedback system with specific projections to each cortical and striatal node of the circuit. We discuss the implications of this newly elaborated circuit for understanding the neural basis of motivational processes.

">Transcriptional and synaptic regulation of NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated hippocampal plasticity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Synapse-to-nucleus signaling regulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying memory by linking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (GluN) to gene transcription mediated by the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), but the underlying gene programs mediating potentiation at excitatory synapses are unknown. Here, we analyzed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets of mouse and human CREB and the synaptonuclear factor CREB-regulated transcription coactivator1 (CRTC1) to identify relevant target genes and biological pathways coupling neuronal activity to synaptic function/plasticity. Our analyses indicate that CRTC1 specifically couples neuronal activity with synaptic plasticity by binding to conserved promoters of CREB target genes comprising inducible transcription factors (including c-fos, Crem, Npas4 and Nr4a1-3), and neuronal excitability and plasticity genes, including Ntrk2, Homer1, Dlg4 (PSD-95) and the NMDA receptor subunit Grin1 (GluN1). CRTC1/CREB target genes were highly enriched in gene ontology (GO) nuclear terms, including several members of the CREB family, and transcriptional modulators and repressors. Interestingly, GO enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed that genes mediating synapse-to-nucleus signaling (including most known synaptonuclear factors and direct interacting modulators) are collectively regulated by CREB/CRTC1, and that protein kinase C (PKC) is a key interactor of the CRTC1/14-3-3 complex at synapses. In agreement with these in silico analyses, we show that CRTC1 regulates synaptic activity-dependent phosphorylation and synaptic recruitment of GluN1 mediated by PKC in hippocampal neurons, and that PKC activation reverses NMDA receptor-mediated currents and long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits caused by CRTC1 silencing in the hippocampus. Consistent with genomics and functional data, morphological and behavioral analyses show crucial roles of CRTC1 on dendritic spine structure, plasticity, and hippocampal-dependent associative memory. Our results support a model in which neuronal activity and synaptic inputs are integrated in the nucleus through conserved CREB/CRTC1-regulated transcriptional programs sustaining global synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathways impacting on synaptic plasticity and memory.

">Shared and individual tuning curves for social vision</a></h4>

              
                A stimulus with light is clearly visual; a stimulus with sound is clearly auditory. But what makes a stimulus "social", and how do judgments of socialness differ across people? Here, we characterize both group-level and individual thresholds for perceiving the presence and nature of a social interaction. We take advantage of the fact that humans are primed to see social interactions-e.g., chasing, playing, fighting-even in very un-lifelike stimuli such as animations of geometric shapes. Unlike prior work using these stimuli, we exploit their most advantageous property, which is that their visual features are fully parameterizable. We use this property to construct psychophysics-inspired "social tuning curves" for individual subjects. Social tuning curves are stable within individuals, unique across individuals, and show some relationship to socio-affective traits. Results support the view that social information processing begins early in the perceptual hierarchy. Further, our approach lays the foundation for a generative account of social perception in single subjects.

">A Causal and Dissociable Role for the Right Inferior Prefrontal Cortex in Empathy for Physical and Social Pain</a></h4>

              
                The right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) are key nodes in the social brain, implicated in empathy for physical and social pain. However, their causal and dissociable contributions remain unclear. In this study, 52 young adults underwent focal transcranial direct current stimulation (f-tDCS) targeting the rIFG or dmPFC in a sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. Participants rated the intensity of pain in images depicting social or physical pain during stimulation. Anodal stimulation to the rIFG increased ratings of physical pain and decreased ratings of social pain, suggesting dissociable roles in processing empathy for these two pain types. In contrast, dmPFC stimulation did not modulate ratings, potentially reflecting its role in higher-order social cognitive processes rather than affective empathy. The effects of rIFG stimulation on social pain were significantly stronger in the initial trials, suggesting potential habituation within the rIFG or stimulation-specific effects. These results provide causal, dissociable evidence for the rIFG's involvement in empathy, with its effects differing based on the type of pain. This supports the proposal that distinct neural processes underlie empathy for social versus physical pain.

	<p>Background/Objectives: In a tonal language like Chinese, phonologically contrasting tones signify word meanings at the syllable level. Although the development of lexical tone perception ability has been examined in many behavioral studies, its developmental trajectory from childhood to adulthood at the neural level remains unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the issue by measuring the mismatch negativity (MMN) response to a Chinese lexical tonal contrast in three groups. Methods: The MMN response to a flat-falling tonal contrast (Tone1 versus Tone4) were recorded from children (25 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;8), adolescents (26 participants aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;14), and young adults (20 participants aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;24). Nonsense speech stimuli were also used by superimposing Tone1 and Tone4 on an English syllable. Results: All three groups demonstrated typical early MMN responses in both the meaningful and nonsense syllable conditions. However, the MMN amplitudes varied significantly across groups, with the child group showing smaller responses compared to the adolescent and adult groups, while the latter two groups had similar MMN amplitudes. Conclusions: Neural sensitivity to tonal contrasts is not fully mature in children and reaches a more adult-like level during adolescence, with no significant difference in sensitivity to meaningful versus nonsense syllables. These results provide new insights into the neural development of lexical tone perception in a tonal language, highlighting its maturation during adolescence in this process.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies, for example, on taste-visual dissonance, have shown that the influence of the visual cortex on taste sensation is enormous. The presented work aims to investigate, using fNIRS, whether a taste stimulus, in this case, the taste of bitter, also causes stimulation of the visual cortex in the fNIRS study. Methods: fNIRS was used to examine 51 participants (204 examinations, 9996 records), collecting signals from the left hemisphere. Differences between the maximum and minimum changes in oxyHb concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb) for the areas of the brain cortex considered responsible for recording visual and gustatory signals were analyzed. Protocols I, II, III, and IV&amp;amp;mdash;activation with distillate water, coffee with lower concentration, reference (no stimulation), and coffee with higher concentration, respectively, were used. Results: We recorded high signals for teste activation on channels covering the gustatory cortex, which confirms the correctness of the choice of research method. As expected, a significant statistical difference was observed between protocols I, II, and IV and reference III (without stimulation). What seems important is the fact that we also received high signals for the channels 45&amp;amp;ndash;49, which cover the visual cortex. The statistical analysis shows no differences between protocols I, II, and IV (different taste activation&amp;amp;mdash;water, coffee A, and coffee B) for specific channels for analyzing regions of interest. As a result of the analysis of the correlation between the subjective bitterness assessment solutions and the signal &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb height, it was observed that a statistically significant correlation, although weak, occurs only for 14 and gustatory channels, only for coffee with a higher concentration. Additionally, the only statistically significant difference between women and men was observed in Protocol I (water), where the &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb signal was twice as high in women compared to men. Conclusions: In conclusion, we can clearly state that the senses of sight and taste work closely together. Moreover, this cooperation is not one-sided: while visual activation influences taste perception, interestingly, a taste stimulus can also generate a hemodynamic response, activating the visual cortex.</p>

	<p>Background: Perfectionism in adolescents can have both adaptive and maladaptive forms, with implications for mental health and school performance. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation in adolescents and to evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducational interventions. Methods: Two studies were conducted: (1) A cross-sectional study (n = 261) examined the correlations among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation. (2) An experimental study (n = 115) evaluated the effects of psychoeducation on perfectionism and healthy habits compared with a control group. The measures included questionnaires on perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional regulation. Results: Study 1 found that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.52, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.48, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), stress (r = 0.45, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and difficulties in emotional regulation (r = 0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Adaptive perfectionism was negatively correlated with deficits in emotional understanding (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Study 2 showed that psychoeducational interventions reduced maladaptive perfectionism (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;5.7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.62) and depression levels (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;3.2, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.38) but increased stress in the experimental groups. No significant changes were observed in adaptive perfectionism or the anxiety level. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex relationships among perfectionism, mental health, and emotional regulation in adolescents. Targeted interventions can reduce maladaptive perfectionism and its associated negative effects. Further research is needed on the long-term outcomes and refinement of interventional strategies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural dynamics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) with aging and their associations with clinical disability and brain structural damage in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One-hundred and forty-one pediatric-onset MS patients (67 pediatric and 74 adults with pediatric-onset) and 233 healthy controls (HC) underwent neurological and 3.0 T MRI assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from the SVZ and the thalamus (as control region).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, SVZ FA was higher until age 40 then declined, whereas MD was lower until age 35 before rising (false discovery rate <i>p</i> value [pFDR] ≤ 0.008). Thalamic FA was higher until age 30 and then declined, whereas MD was higher until age 50 (pFDR ≤ 0.007). Pediatric MS patients showed significantly higher SVZ FA than pediatric HC (pFDR &lt; 0.001), while adult patients showed no differences compared to adult HC (pFDR ≤ 0.724). Adult patients had lower thalamic FA and higher MD (pFDR &lt; 0.001). Adults had lower SVZ FA and MD, but higher thalamic MD compared to pediatric patients (pFDR &lt; 0.001). In pediatric MS, higher SVZ FA and MD were associated with higher white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV) and choroid plexus volume and lower brain and thalamic volumes (pFDR ≤ 0.047). In adult patients, higher SVZ MD associated with higher WM LV, lower brain volumes, and lower z-SDMT (pFDR≤0.019). Thalamic microstructural abnormalities were associated with more severe disability and brain damage in both groups (pFDR ≤ 0.018).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the SVZ occur early in pediatric MS and are associated with brain structural damage but not with clinical impairment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>This study assesses whether longitudinal quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration after large middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and determines how early changes are detectable.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, single-center observational cohort study included patients with large MCA stroke admitted to Boston Medical Center's intensive care unit (2019–2024). Associations between time-to-neurologic deterioration and quantitative pupillometry, including Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates adjusted for age, sex, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Models using dilation velocity were compared with partial likelihood ratio tests. Pupillometric changes over 2-h intervals in the 12 h preceding deterioration were analyzed with linear mixed-effects modeling and Tukey's test. Matched referents (age, sex, stroke side, follow-up duration) were used for comparison. Optimal thresholds were identified using the Youden Index.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 71 patients (mean age 66.5 years; 59.2% women), 32 (45.1%) experienced deterioration. A 1-unit decrease in NPi was associated with a higher hazard of deterioration (hazard ratio 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.61). Dilation velocity improved model performance compared to NPi alone. NPi was significantly lower at 0–2 h (3.81 vs. 4.38, p = 0.001) and 2–4 h (3.71 vs. 4.38, p &lt; 0.001) before deterioration compared to 10–12 h prior. Optimal thresholds were 4.01 for NPi, 0.49 mm/s for dilation velocity, and −0.15 change in NPi over 12 h.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration in MCA stroke, with declines detectable up to 12 h prior. Dilation velocity shows promise as a novel biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Neuropeptides belonging to the cholecystokinin/sulfakinin (CCK/SK) family mediate satiety signals across phylogeny. In this study, a potential anatomical substrate for such satiety signals was described in the snail <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i>. We propose that CCK/SK signals directly modulate gustatory sensory neurons that project from the lips to the brain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Snails belonging to the genus <i>Biomphalaria</i> serve as obligatory intermediate hosts for the trematode <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>, the causative agent for the most widespread form of schistosomiasis. The simpler nervous systems of gastropod molluscs, such as <i>Biomphalaria</i>, provide advantageous models for investigating neural responses to infection at the cellular and network levels. The present study examined neuropeptides related to cholecystokinin (CCK), a major multifunctional regulator of central nervous system (CNS) function in mammals. A neural transcriptome generated from the CNS of <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> included a transcript encoding two CCK-related peptides, designated <i>Balex</i>-CCK1 (pEGEWSYDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GLGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>) and <i>Balex</i>-CCK2 (NYGDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GIGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>). Peptide expression was examined in <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> at the mRNA level using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) protocol and at the protein level using an antibody against <i>Balex</i>-CCK1. Expression was detected in 60–70 neurons distributed throughout the CNS, as well as in profuse fiber systems connecting the ganglia and projecting to the periphery. CCK-like immunoreactive (CCK<sub>li</sub>) fibers were also observed on organs associated with the cardiorespiratory (nephridium, mantle, gill) and male reproductive systems. A comparison of mRNA and peptide localization suggested that CCK expression could be regulated at the level of translation. A potential role of these peptides in mediating responses to infection by larval schistosomes is discussed.</p>

">Biased replay of aversive and uncertain outcomes underlies irrational decision making</a></h4>

              
                Humans often make irrational decisions when facing uncertain or aversive future events despite careful deliberation. How we make choices, including irrational ones, has been the object of extensive study both behaviourally and neurally and is the focus of influential behavioural economic theories. Yet, little is known about how these (irrational) decisions are carved out in the brain. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we show that the construction and outcome evaluation of irrational decisions involves rapid, sequential state reactivation, or "replay.". During deliberation, we show that forward replay is biased towards choice options with more negative and uncertain outcomes, with this bias further amplified immediately preceding irrational choice. Likewise, post-decision evaluation relates to replay in a choice-dependent manner. Following irrational choices, relief-like signals were evident as stronger backward replay of worse counterfactual options, while after rational decisions, regret-like signals appeared as stronger backward replay of better counterfactual options. Together, these findings suggest that neural replay shapes both the formation and reflection of irrational decisions, and poise replay as a candidate mechanism underlying pervasive decision biases in humans.

">Lipid-protecting disulfide bridges are the missing molecular link between ApoE4 and sporadic Alzheimers disease in humans</a></h4>

              
                As the principal lipid transporter in the human brain, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is tasked with the transport and protection of highly vulnerable lipids required to support and remodel neuronal membranes, in a process that is dependent on ApoE receptors. Human APOE allele variants that encode proteins differing only in the number of cysteine (Cys)-to-arginine (Arg) exchanges (ApoE2 [2 Cys], ApoE3 [1 Cys], ApoE4 [0 Cys]) comprise the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD); however, the specific molecular feature(s) and resultant mechanisms that underlie these isoform-dependent effects are unknown. One signature feature of Cys is the capacity to form disulfide (Cys-Cys) bridges, which are required to form disulfide bridge-linked dimers and multimers. Here we propose the overarching hypothesis that the super-ability (for ApoE2), intermediate ability (for ApoE3) or inability (for ApoE4) to form lipid-protecting intermolecular disulfide bridges, is the central molecular determinant accounting for the disparate effects of APOE alleles on AD risk and amyloid-{beta} and Tau pathologies in humans. We posit that presence and abundance of Cys in human ApoE3 and ApoE2 respectively, conceal and protect vulnerable lipids transported by ApoE from peroxidation by enabling formation of ApoE homo-dimers/multimers and heteromeric ApoE complexes such as ApoE-ApoJ and ApoE-ApoD. We thus propose that the inability to form intermolecular disulfide bridges makes ApoE4-containing lipoproteins uniquely vulnerable to peroxidation and its downstream consequences. Consistent with our model, we found that brain-enriched polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids induce disulfide-dependent dimerization and multimerization of ApoE3 and ApoE2 (but not ApoE4). By contrast, incubation with the artificial peroxidation-resistant lipid DMPC or cholesterol alone had minimal effects on dimerization. These novel concepts and findings are integrated into our unifying model implicating peroxidation of ApoE-containing lipoproteins, with consequent ApoE receptor-ligand disruption, as the initiating molecular events that ultimately lead to AD in humans.

                Lecanemab, an Alzheimer's disease US Food and Drug Administration approved monoclonal antibody was previously reported to have a high affinity against intermediately sized amyloid-{beta} aggregates. Subsequently, it was observed by immunogold labelling that lecanemab can also bind to human type-I amyloid-{beta} fibrils. Therefore, to determine whether lecanemab binds to amyloid-{beta} fibril structures other than type-I, we performed immunogold labelling on extracted amyloid-{beta} fibril preparations from six different Alzheimer's disease mouse models whose structures were previously solved by cryo-EM. Our results show that lecanemab exhibits high binding affinity to amyloid-{beta} fibril structures that have a flexible N-terminus in common, as it is the case for type-I, type-II and murine type-III amyloid-{beta} fibril polymorphs which resemble or are identical to human structures observed in sporadic and familial cases of Alzheimer's disease, including a case with the Arctic (E22G) mutation. In contrast, only weak, if any, lecanemab binding was observed for amyloid-{beta} fibril folds with a fixed and ordered N-terminus.

">Rescue of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory performance by Fingolimod (FTY720) in APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by correction in metabolism of sphingolipids, polyamines, and phospholipid saturation composition</a></h4>

              
                Previously, our metabolomic, transcriptomic, and genomic studies characterized the ceramide/sphingomyelin pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, and we demonstrated that FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phospahate receptor modulator approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, recovers synaptic plasticity and memory in APP/PS1 mice. To further investigate how FTY720 rescues the pathology, we performed metabolomic analysis in brain, plasma, and liver of trained APP/PS1 and wild-type mice. APP/PS1 mice showed area-specific brain disturbances in polyamines, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Most changes were completely or partially normalized in FTY720-treated subjects, indicating rebalancing the "sphingolipid rheostat", reactivating phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase pathway, and normalizing polyamine levels that support mitochondrial activity. Synaptic plasticity and memory were rescued, with spermidine synthesis in temporal cortex best corresponding to hippocampal CA3-CA1 plasticity normalization. FTY720 effects, also reflected in other pathways, are consistent with promotion of mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and anti-inflammatory environment, while reducing pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signals.

">Microglial SIRT2 deficiency aggravates cognitive decline and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global SIRT2 inhibition has shown promise in reducing amyloid-beta pathology and cognitive deficits in different mouse models of AD, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition has been associated with adverse effects, such as increased inflammation. This suggests that targeted inhibition of specific cellular populations within the brain may represent a more precise and effective approach for the treatment of AD. To explore this hypothesis, we generated a conditional microglial SIRT2 knockout mouse model in the context of AD. Our results reveal that microglial SIRT2 reduction does not confer protective effects in the APP/PS1 model; rather, it aggravates cognitive decline, accelerates amyloid plaque deposition, and increases levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at early stages of AD pathology. Transcriptomic analysis further indicates that SIRT2-deficient microglia exhibit altered expression of genes associated with aging and synaptic dysfunction. This phenotype was accompanied by increased phagocytosis of synaptic elements and impaired long-term potentiation. These findings suggest that while SIRT2 inhibition in some contexts may be beneficial, targeted inhibition within microglia could accelerate AD progression, underscoring the need for cell-specific approaches when considering SIRT2 as a therapeutic target.

">Impact of meningioma and glioma on whole-brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Brain tumors, particularly meningiomas and gliomas, can profoundly affect neural function, yet their impact on brain dynamics remains incompletely understood. This study investigates alterations in normal brain function among meningioma and glioma patients by assessing dynamical complexity through the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. We analyzed resting-state fMRI data from 34 participants to quantify brain dynamics using intrinsic ignition and metastability metrics. Our results revealed distinct patterns of disruption: glioma patients showed significant reductions in both metrics compared to controls, indicating widespread network disturbances. In contrast, meningioma patients exhibited significant changes predominantly in regions with substantial tumor involvement. Resting-state network analysis demonstrated strong metastability and metastability/ignition correlations between regions in controls, which were slightly weakened in meningioma patients and severely disrupted in glioma patients. These findings highlight the differential impacts of gliomas and meningiomas on brain function, offering insights into their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, these results show that brain dynamics metrics can be effective biomarkers for identifying disruptions in brain information transmission caused by tumors.

">Efficacy of functional connectome fingerprinting using tangent-space brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectomes (FCs) are estimations of brain region interaction derived from brain activity, often obtained from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging recordings. Quantifying the distance between FCs is important for understanding the relation between behaviour, disorders, disease, and changes in connectivity. Recently, tangent space projections, which account for the curvature of the mathematical space of FCs, have been proposed for calculating FC distances. We compare the efficacy of this approach relative to the traditional method in the context of subject identification using the Midnight Scan Club dataset, in order to study resting-state and task-based subject discriminability. The tangent space method is found to universally out-perform the traditional method. We also focus on the subject identification efficacy of subnetworks. Certain subnetworks are found to outperform others, a dichotomy which largely follows the `control' and `processing' categorization of resting state networks, and relates subnetwork flexibility with subject discriminability. Identification efficacy is also modulated by tasks, though certain subnetworks appear task independent. The uniquely long recordings of the dataset also allow for explorations of resource requirements for effective subject identification. The tangent space method is found to universally require less data, making it well suited when only short recordings are available.

">Post-movement beta rebound reflects strategic re-aiming during motor adaptation, but not re-aiming accuracy</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation results from several interacting learning mechanisms, including learning via cognitive strategies and implicit adaptation. While strategy-based and implicit learning can be dissociated at a behavioural level, their underlying systems-level physiology is poorly understood. A neural signal that undergoes pronounced changes during motor adaptation is the post-movement beta-rebound (PMBR). However, it is unclear how these changes relate to the specific learning mechanisms that contribute to motor adaptation. We measured electroencephalography (EEG) while healthy participants (N=27) performed reaching movements towards a target. In most trials, a cursor showed the veridical position of the unseen hand, however, for some reaches, the direction of the cursor was rotated relative to the position of the hand. Participants were informed that, once a rotation occurred, it could persist for a single trial (1x condition), or for two consecutive trial (2x condition). In the 2x condition, participants could therefore redirect the rotated cursor through the target in the second rotated trial by re-aiming, while they had to continue aiming at the target in the 1x condition. We observed a stronger decrease of PMBR following the first rotated reach in the 2x condition, compared to the 1x condition, despite similar kinematics. This corroborates our previous results that PMBR reflects strategic re-aiming (Korka et al., 2023). However, when we collapsed data from the two studies (total N=53), we found that the degree to which the PMBR decreases does not predict re-aiming accuracy. We discuss the role of PMBR in motor adaptation, including implications for clinical disorders.

">Cholinergic Modulation of Chandelier Cells via Heteromeric Nicotinic Receptors in Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a distinct subtype of GABAergic interneurons that form vertical arrays of presynaptic boutons targeting the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal neurons (PNs). They are particularly abundant in prefrontal cortex, where cholinergic inputs modulate cognitive functions and shape ChC axonal development. However, the effects of the cholinergic system on ChC activity in the adult brain remain largely unexplored. Here, using a genetic intersectional strategy (VipR2-Pvalb-Ai65) in adult mice, we selectively labeled ChCs in the secondary motor cortex (M2). Immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology confirmed morphological and functional properties distinguishing them from basket cells. We found that these ChCs exhibit an inward current in response to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. Pharmacological blockade and fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that this effect is primarily mediated by heteromeric nAChRs containing {beta}2 subunits, with a smaller contribution from 3 subunits. Optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic axons evoked inward currents in ChCs, confirming a functional cholinergic drive. Furthermore, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging revealed a strong correlation between ChC activity and behavioral markers of arousal, including locomotion and pupil dilation. Importantly, the application of nicotinic receptor antagonists significantly diminished ChC activity during movement. Together, these results indicate that ChCs are modulated by cholinergic input via heteromeric nAChRs, emphasizing their importance in facilitating state-dependent cortical dynamics.

">Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 protects neurons from Sarm1-mediated neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The Sarm1 NAD+ hydrolase drives neurodegeneration in many contexts, but how Sarm1 activity is regulated remains poorly defined. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we found loss of VHL suppressed Sarm1-mediated cellular degeneration. VHL normally promotes O2-dependent constitutive ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), but during hypoxia, HIF-1 is stabilized and regulates gene expression. We observed neuroprotection after depletion of VHL or other factors required for HIF-1 degradation, and expression of a non-ubiquitinated HIF-1 variant led to even stronger blockade of axon degeneration in mammals and Drosophila. Neuroprotection required HIF-1 DNA binding, prolonged expression, and resulted in broad gene expression changes. Unexpectedly, stabilized HIF-1 prevented the precipitous NAD+ loss driven by Sarm1 activation in neurons, despite NAD+ hydrolase activity being intrinsic to the Sarm1 TIR domain. Our work argues hypoxia inhibits Sarm1 activity through HIF-1 driven transcriptional changes, rendering neurons less sensitive to Sarm1-mediated neurodegeneration when in a hypoxic state.

">Fentanyl blockade of K+ channels contribute to Wooden Chest Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid widely used perioperatively and illicitly as a drug of abuse. It is well established that fentanyl acts as a -opioid receptor agonist, signaling through Gi/o intracellular pathways to inhibit electrical excitability, resulting in analgesia and respiratory depression. However, fentanyl uniquely also triggers muscle rigidity, including respiratory muscles, hindering the ability to execute central respiratory commands or to receive external resuscitation. This potentially lethal condition is termed Wooden Chest Syndrome (WCS), the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Here we show that fentanyl directly blocks a subset of EAG-class potassium channels. Our results also demonstrate that these channels are widely expressed in cervical spinal motoneurons, including those innervating the diaphragm. A significant fraction of these motoneurons is excited by fentanyl, concomitant with blockade of voltage-dependent non-inactivating K+ currents. In vivo electromyography revealed a persistent tonic component of diaphragmatic muscle activity elicited by fentanyl, but not morphine. Taken together our results identify a novel off-target mechanism for fentanyl action, independent of -opioid receptor activation, with a paradoxical excitatory effect that may underlie WCS. We anticipate these findings may inform the design of safer analgesics and generalize to other neuronal circuits implicated in fentanyl-related maladaptive behaviors.

                Nerve transfer surgery is a state-of-the-art surgical approach to restore hand and arm function in individuals living with tetraplegia, significantly impacting daily life. While nearly a third of all individuals with chronic SCI may benefit from this intervention, variability in outcomes can limit the functional impact. A bedside-to-bench approach was taken to address the variable response of tetraplegic individuals to nerve transfer surgery. We used a hierarchical multiple factor analysis to evaluate the effects of conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) on outcomes in a mouse model of nerve transfer to treat chronic cervical spinal cord injury. We found that CES of donor nerves one week prior to nerve transfer surgery enhanced anatomical and functional measures of innervation of targeted muscles. Furthermore, CES increased the rate of recovery of naturalistic behavior. While the model has some limitations due to the small size of the rodent, our results support the use of CES as an effective approach to improve outcomes in clinical nerve repair settings.

                Mechanisms that trigger A{beta} production in sporadic Alzheimer's disease are still obscure. We recently reported the expression of a human circular RNA (circA{beta}-a) encoded A{beta} peptide precursor variant (A{beta}175). Presently, we demonstrated that AAV9 virus-expressed circA{beta}-a gave rise to extensive extracellular A{beta} plaque depositions and microglial activation in mouse brain; this recapitulates critical pathogenic hallmarks within a sporadic AD mouse model. Specifically developed antibodies detected robust endogenous A{beta}175 expression in HEK293 cells and hNSC-derived human neurons, underscoring the potential of A{beta}175 as a salient A{beta} precursor. Furthermore, we detected high levels of A{beta}175 oligomers in young-adult human brains. In intermediate and old-age human brain samples, accumulation of soluble A{beta}175 pentamers was reduced and A{beta}175 oligomers were components of most insoluble A{beta} plaques in older human brain. We propose a causal relationship between human circA{beta}-a RNA expression, dysregulation of A{beta}175 oligomer processing/aggregation and A{beta} plaque accumulation in sporadic AD.

                Rationale: WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a gene associated implicated in both neurologic and inflammatory diseases and is susceptible to environmental stressors. We hypothesize partial loss of Wwox function will result in increased sepsis severity and neuroinflammation. Methods: Wwox WT/P47T mice, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, and Wwox WT/WT mice were treated with intraperitoneal PBS vs LPS (10mg/kg) and euthanized 12 hours post-injection. Open Field Testing (OFT) and Murine Sepsis Severity Scores (MSS) were utilized to measure sickness behavior and sepsis severity, respectively. Brain tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and PCR to measure neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Results: Wwox WT/P47T LPS mice demonstrated a more significant response to sepsis with an increase in sickness behavior, sepsis severity, gliosis, and apoptosis compared to Wwow WT/WT LPS littermates. Conclusions: Partial loss of Wwox function increases risk for severe sepsis and neuroinflammation. Given the susceptibility of WWOX to environmental stressors, this may be a target for future therapeutic interventions.

">Simultaneous EEG-PET-MRI identifies temporally coupled, spatially structured hemodynamic and metabolic dynamics across wakefulness and NREM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep entails significant changes in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism. Yet, the way these processes evolve throughout wakefulness and sleep and their spatiotemporal dependence remain largely unknown. Here, by integrating a novel functional PET technique with simultaneous EEG-fMRI, we reveal a tightly coupled temporal progression of global hemodynamics and metabolism during the descent into NREM sleep, with large hemodynamic fluctuations emerging as global glucose metabolism declines, both of which track EEG arousal dynamics. Furthermore, we identify two distinct network patterns that emerge during NREM sleep: an oscillating, high-metabolism sensorimotor network remains active and dynamic, whereas hemodynamic and metabolic activity in the default-mode network is suppressed. These results elucidate how sleep diminishes awareness while preserving sensory responses, and uncover a complex, alternating balance of neuronal, hemodynamic, and metabolic dynamics in the sleeping brain. This work also demonstrates the potential of EEG-PET-MRI to explore neuro-hemo-metabolic dynamics underlying cognition and arousal in humans.

">Functional organization of the neonatal thalamus across development depicted by functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a central component of the brain that is involved in a variety of functions, from sensory processing to high-order cognition. Its structure and function in the first weeks of extrauterine life, including its connections to different cortical and subcortical areas, have not yet been widely explored. Here, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 730 newborns from the developing Human Connectome Project to study the functional organization of the thalamus from 37 to 44 post-conceptual weeks. We introduce KNIT: K-means for Nuclei in Infant Thalamus. The framework employs a highly granular vector space of 40 features, each corresponding to functional connectivity to a brain region, using k-means clustering and uncertainty quantification through bootstrapping to delineate thalamic units. Although the different clusters showed common patterns of increased connectivity to the superior temporal gyrus, the parietal, and the frontal cortex, implying an expected decrease in specialization at that age, they also show some specificity. That is, a pulvinar unit was identified, similar to the adult thalamus. Ventrolateral motor and medial salience units were also highlighted. The latter appeared around 41 weeks of age, while the former showed at least from 37 weeks, but had a decrease in volume through age, replaced mostly by a dominant dorsal thalamic unit. We also observed an increase in clustering robustness and in hemispheric bilateral symmetry with age, suggesting more specialized functional units. We also found a burst in global thalamic connectivity around 41 weeks. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of this method in terms of granularity compared to the more conventional winner-takes-all approach.

">Postnatal reduction of eIF4E overexpression in D1-SPNs ameliorates KCNQ dysfunction, hyperexcitability and ASD-like behaviours.</a></h4>

              
                An imbalance between the direct and indirect pathways of the striatum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD, which corresponds with an increase in repetitive behaviours and hyperactivity. The ASD risk gene EIF4E promotes translation, and its overexpression in mice increases repetitive behaviours and hyperactivity. We used the eIF4E-transgenic mouse model of ASD to study cell-type specific disruptions in the direct and indirect pathways using fibre photometry, electrophysiology, conditional gene silencing, and behavioural analysis. We found that direct pathway SPNs activity increased during exploratory behaviour and identified D1-SPN hyperexcitability and reduced KCNQ channel function in striatal slices. Reduction of eIF4E specifically in the D1-SPNs of adult mice normalised KCNQ function, D1-SPN hyperexcitability and ameliorated repetitive and hyperactive behaviours. Our results highlight the critical role of eIF4E in ASD-associated motor behaviours, elucidate cell-specific mechanisms driving hyperactivity and provide new insight into potential therapeutic targets for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, this study underscores the translational potential of modulating protein synthesis pathways to address core motor symptoms in ASD.

">Differential regulation of brain-specific molecular pathways is the reason for curcumin adult life-phase specific DAergic neuroprotection: Insights from ALSS Drosophila model of Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                Curcumin (CU), a bioactive compound of turmeric, has been put forward as a golden molecule due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer ability, as proven by research conducted over the decade and more. Our laboratory, developed an adult life stage specific (ALSS) Drosophila model of sporadic Parkinson disease (PD), and for first time demonstrated that dopaminergic (DAergic) neuroprotective efficacy of curcumin is limited to health phase viz. adult-young life stage and is absent during transition phase viz. adult senior life stages when PD set in. This observation suggests the limitation of curcumin as a therapeutic agent for late-onset disorders like PD. Further, our laboratory also demonstrated that despite curcumin ability to sequester oxidative stress during both the adult life stages, neuroprotection and brain dopamine replenishment is granted only in health stages but not in a vulnerable transition stage, which prompted to put forward the hypothesis that the molecular target(s) of CU, may be absent or inadequate in the transition stage of aging brain. With this insight, the current study was implemented to analyse the life stage-specific differential regulation of multiple molecular players of neuro-integral pathways in brain of ALSS Drosophila model of PD with curcumin intervention. It is discovered that curcumin-mediated health phase-specific neuroprotection underlies the correction of an altered expression of 1. dFOXO, GADD45, Puc of Bsk-dFOXO stress response pathway, 2. Mfn2 of Mitochondrial dynamics 3. CncC, GCLC, Prx 2540 -1,2, Jafrac1, Prx3 of Phase II antioxidant defense system pathway. Further, it is discovered that significant aging-associated naturally altered expression of certain molecular targets exists, that may contribute to the limitation of curcumin DAergic neuroprotective efficacy during the adult-transition stage. This knowledge will help in developing altered therapeutic strategies for PD as molecular targets of curcumin are conserved among fly, mice and human.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sexual minority older adults (SMOAs) report greater subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than heterosexual older adults (HOAs). This study aimed to compare the impact of multiple psycho-social risk factors on objective and subjective cognitive decline in HOAs and SMOAs. Methods: Two samples of self-identified HOAs and SMOAs were selected from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Reliable change indices for episodic and semantic memory were created to assess cognitive decline. SCD was self-reported for memory and general cognition. Depressive symptoms, loneliness, marital status and socio-economic status were investigated as risk factors. Results: No between-group differences were found in cognitive decline. Higher depression was associated with greater SCD risk and worse semantic memory decline. The latter effect was stronger in SMOAs. The findings were largely replicated in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Poor mental health may represent the strongest driver of cognitive decline in SMOAs and to a greater extent than in HOAs.</p>

	<p>Background: Tramadol (TRA) is an opioid that is used to manage moderate to severe pain. Long-term use of TRA can lead to the development of opioid use disorder. Objectives: This study investigates the role of forced exercise in reducing TRA-seeking behavior. Methods: Adult male rats (240&amp;amp;ndash;260 g) were divided into five groups; the control group received vehicle injections, the TRA group received TRA (75 mg/kg, i.p) every other day for 8 days, and three TRA&amp;amp;ndash;exercise groups were forced to run on a treadmill (60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 2, 4, or 6 weeks prior to conditioning with TRA. A tramadol-conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure assessed TRA reinforcement, after which all rats were euthanized, tissue extracted, and mRNA expression for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1&amp;amp;beta;) determined in hippocampus (Hipp), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Results: TRA-seeking behavior was seen in the TRA group and the 6 weeks forced exercise group. By contrast, forced exercise for 2 or 4 weeks attenuated TRA-seeking behavior. This attenuation was associated with a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA expression in the Hipp and NAc, but not the PFC. Additionally, the TRA-induced elevations in Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression were reversed by all durations of exercise in Hipp. However, only 2 and 4 weeks, but not 6 weeks, of exercise reduced elevations in PFC and NAc Il-1&amp;amp;beta; expression. Conclusion: Forced exercise for 2 and 4 weeks attenuates TRA-seeking behavior partially through the regulation of Bdnf and Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression.</p>

                <p>The subjective visual vertical (VV), the visually estimated direction of gravity, is essential for assessing vestibular function and visuospatial cognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying altered VV perception in stroke participants with unilateral spatial neglect (USN), specifically by examining their eye movement patterns during VV judgment tasks. Participants with USN demonstrated limited eye movement scanning along a rotating bar, often fixating on prominent ends, such as the top or bottom. This suggests a reflexive response to visually salient areas, potentially interfering with accurate VV perception. In contrast, participants without USN showed broader scanning around the center of the bar. Notably, participants with USN without frontal lobe lesions occasionally exhibited extended scanning that included the bar&rsquo;s center, which was associated with accurate VV judgments. These findings suggest that (1) a tendency to fixate on peripheral, prominent areas and (2) frontal lobe involvement in disengaging and redirecting spatial attention may influence VV perception in USN. Based on these results, targeted rehabilitation strategies that encourage individuals with USN to extend their visual scanning beyond prominent endpoints and include central areas could improve VV accuracy. This study highlights the specific eye movement behaviors contributing to VV misperception, emphasizing the importance of training that broadens scanning to improve VV perception effectively.</p>

                <p>A comprehensive analysis of everyday sound perception can be achieved using electroencephalography (EEG) with the concurrent acquisition of information about the environment. While extensive research has been dedicated to speech perception, the complexities of auditory perception within everyday environments, specifically the types of information and the key features to extract, remain less explored. Our study aims to systematically investigate the relevance of different feature categories: discrete sound-identity markers, general cognitive state information, and acoustic representations, including discrete sound onset, the envelope, and mel-spectrogram. Using continuous data analysis, we contrast different features in terms of their predictive power for unseen data and thus their distinct contributions to explaining neural data. For this, we analyze data from a complex audio-visual motor task using a naturalistic soundscape. The results demonstrated that the feature sets that explain the most neural variability were a combination of highly detailed acoustic features with a comprehensive description of specific sound onsets. Furthermore, it showed that established features can be applied to complex soundscapes. Crucially, the outcome hinged on excluding periods devoid of sound onsets in the analysis in the case of the discrete features. Our study highlights the importance to comprehensively describe the soundscape, using acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, to fully understand the dynamics of sound perception in complex situations. This approach can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to investigate sound perception in natural settings.</p>

                <p>Alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure are commonly found in migraine patients. Here, we employ a longitudinal study of episodic migraine without aura using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate whether such WM microstructure alterations vary through the different phases of the pain cycle. Fourteen patients with episodic migraine without aura related with menstruation were scanned through four phases of their (spontaneous) migraine cycle (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal). Fifteen healthy controls were studied in the corresponding phases of the menstrual cycle. Multishell dMRI data were acquired and preprocessed to obtain maps of diffusion parameters reflecting WM microstructure. After a whole-brain analysis comparing patients with controls, a region-of-interest analysis was performed to determine whether the patients&rsquo; microstructural changes varied across the migraine cycle in specific WM tracts. Compared with controls, patients showed reduced axial diffusivity (AD) in several WM tracts across the whole brain in the interictal phase and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in commissural fibers in the ictal phase. Interestingly, AD returned to baseline levels during peri-ictal phases in specific projection and association fibers. In contrast, FA values decreased in the ictal phase away from normal values in a few commissural and projection tracts. Widespread WM fiber tracts suffer structural variations across the migraine cycle, suggesting microstructural changes potentially associated with limbic and salience functional networks and highlighting the importance of the cycle phase in imaging studies of migraine.</p>

                <p>Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy&ndash;aphasia syndrome (EAS) is a spectrum of childhood disorders that exhibit complex comorbidities that include epilepsy and the emergence of cognitive and language disorders. CNKSR2 is an X-linked gene in which mutations are linked to EAS. We previously demonstrated Cnksr2 knock-out (KO) mice model key phenotypes of EAS analogous to those present in clinical patients with mutations in the gene. Cnksr2 KO mice have increased seizures, impaired learning and memory, increased levels of anxiety, and loss of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The intricate interplay between these diverse phenotypes at the brain regional and cell-type level remains unknown. Here, we leverage conditional deletion of the X-linked Cnksr2 in a neuronal cell-type manner in male mice to demonstrate that anxiety and impaired USVs track with its loss from excitatory neurons. Finally, we further narrow the essential role of Cnksr2 loss in USV deficits to excitatory neurons of the ACC, a region in mice recently implicated in USV production associated with specific emotional states or social contexts, such as mating calls, distress calls, or social bonding signals. Together, our results reveal Cnksr2-based mechanisms that underlie USV impairments that suggest communication impairments can be dissociated from seizures or anxiety. Furthermore, we highlight the cortical circuitry important for initiating USVs.</p>

                Aim To determine the influencing factors of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) perceived by North-African children/adolescents with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and their parents. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in Tunisia. A total of 116 patients ( ie ; 43 children and 73 adolescents) and their parents were included. The Arabic validated version of the Pediatric Generic Core Quality-of-Life Inventory 4.0-Scale (PedsQL4.0) was used to evaluate the HRQoL of children/adolescents as perceived by patients and parents. The dependent data were the patients’ self-report and the parents’ proxy-report of the PedsQL4.0 total scores, and the independent data were the patients and parents characteristics. Results Patients’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The combination of these factors explained 34.84% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Parents’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by lipodystrophy, siblings; body mass index (BMI), hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C. The combination of these factors explained 56.92% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Conclusion T1DM patients self-reported HRQoL was influenced by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and HbA1C. The parents’ proxy-report HRQoL was influenced by lipodystrophy, siblings, BMI, hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C.

                Introduction Recent reports indicate the emergence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with K64- Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Here, we identify the capsular types and sequence type of invasive and commensal K. pneumoniae isolates from Vietnam. Methods We included 93 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients hospitalized at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi between 2007 and 2011; and 110 commensal isolates from throat swabs from healthy volunteers living in rural and urban Hanoi in 2012. We determined sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and capsule typing for seven K types by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Results The most common detected capsule types were K1 (39/203, 19.2%, mainly ST23) and K2 (31/203, 15.3%, multiple STs: ST65, ST86, ST380). We found significantly more K2 isolates among invasive in comparison to commensal isolates (22.6% vs 9%, p = 0.01) but no significant difference was observed between invasive and commensal K1 isolates (14.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.075). K64 with varying sequence types were predominantly seen among invasive K. pneumoniae (8 vs. 3) and were isolated from sepsis and meningitis patients. Among K64 isolates, one was carbapenem-resistant with ST799. Conclusion Our study confirms that capsule type K64 K. pneumoniae is associated with community-acquired invasive infections in Vietnam. Research is needed to unravel the mechanisms of virulence of capsule type K64 in both community and hospital settings.

                Background Rehabilitation services are necessary for many people with disabilities to improve their functioning and be included in society. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile in 2015. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from Chile’s 2015 Second National Disability Study (ENDISC II) included people with disabilities aged ≥18 years. The dependent variable was the use of rehabilitation services in the previous year, and the exposure variables were sociodemographic and confounders. Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors, and prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. All results were weighted according to the ENDISC II complex sampling. Results A total of 2610 people with disabilities were included, and 19.1% used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. Educational level (PR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.75), having a mental illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.44–2.18), and caregiver assistance (PR 1.57; 95% CI 1.25–1.97) were factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services. Conclusions In 2015, one-fifth of people with disabilities in Chile used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. People with disabilities with lower educational levels were less likely to access these services. By contrast, people with mental illness and caregiver assistance were more likely to use rehabilitation services.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                Background This study investigates chloride concentrations in tap water samples from Gimba city administration, using the argentometric method to assess water quality. Chloride levels are a key indicator of water treatment effectiveness, particularly the adequacy of chlorination, which is critical for preventing waterborne diseases. Methods Chloride concentrations in tap water samples from various locations in Gimba city administration, were determined using the argentometric titration method. Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) was employed as the titrant to precisely quantify chloride ions. The water samples were collected from different sites in Gimba, and chloride levels were measured to evaluate the adequacy of water treatment processes. Results The chloride concentrations across all samples ranged from 52.8 mg/L to 71.9 mg/L, well below the World Health Organization’s recommended limit for drinking water. Significant variation in chloride levels was observed, with Dembesh exhibiting the highest concentration and Medera the lowest. Conclusion The low chloride concentrations suggest insufficient chlorination at the sampling sites, which may compromise the effectiveness of water disinfection and contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the region. The study underscores the need for enhanced water treatment and disinfection practices in Gimba city to ensure safe drinking water and reduce health risks.

                Backgrounds Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Indonesia, ranking second globally in TB incidence in 2021. Diagnosing intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its symptoms, which mimic other diseases, limited laboratory tests, and the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive laboratory panel for ITB using various biomarkers. Methods A cross-sectional study from November 2020 to December 2022 was carried out at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital. Laboratory parameters from 143 subjects were identified by Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis. The scoring system was developed based on the identified independent diagnostic parameters scored by regression coefficient β value and standard errors, with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system were determined using the ROC curve. Results Among 143 subjects, 22 were diagnosed with ITB and 121 Non-ITB (prevalence of 15.38%). This study was dominated by females (65.03%), with a ratio of 1.86: 1. The median age in this study was 41 years. The scoring system to differentiate ITB and Non-ITB consisted of 6 diagnostic parameters (referred to as the HEALTH scoring system) as follows: stool HBD-2 (1 and 0 points), ESR (1 and 0 points), blood ADA activity (1 and 0 points), Lymphocyte (0 and 1 point), stool TB PCR (2 and 0 points), and NLR (1 and 0 points). Subjects with scores ≥ 4 could be diagnosed as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of the HEALTH scoring system were 68.18% and 95.04%, respectively. Conclusion This study developed and validated a laboratory panel called the HEALTH scoring system based on clinical biomarkers of stool HBD-2 level, ESR, blood ADA activity, lymphocytes, stool TB PCR, and NLR, which could be used to differentiate ITB from other gastrointestinal diseases.

                Background This study analyzed the nexus between rural household welfare and agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia using secondary data from the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s economy, contributing significantly to income, consumption, and employment. This research aims to analyze how adopting agricultural technologies such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation affects poverty and food insecurity among rural households. The research examined poverty and food insecurity levels in Ethiopia and investigates the impact of adopting agricultural technologies on rural household welfare. Methods We used both Descriptive and econometric methods, in which descriptive analysis has been used to assess poverty and food insecurity levels, and a seemingly unrelated bivariate and multivariate probit model applied to analyze the effect of agricultural technology adoption. Result From descriptive summary, it is noted that out of a total sample of the study, 47.61% (2322 out of 4877) are adopting agricultural technologies in many forms more than 70% of female-headed households are food secured and non-poor and 68% of male-headed households are food secured and nun poor. The findings from regression model indicate that access to irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizers significantly reduces the likelihood of poverty and food insecurity among rural households. Conclusion Based on these results, policy recommendations include promoting agricultural technologies, enhancing access to credit, investing in agricultural extension services, diversifying livelihoods, improving education, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Further research is encouraged to explore the reasons behind insignificant variables and to identify additional factors affecting rural household welfare in Ethiopia.

                Background This study was designed to investigate the mediation effects of social empowerment (SE) in the relationship between perceived social support (PSS) and life satisfaction (LS) in women self-help group members. Also, this research attempted to understand the moderating effect of decision making (DM) and external communication (EC) on the relationship between the constructs. Methods To achieve the above objective, the primary data were collected from the self-help group women members by using an existing scale. In this survey, 333 participants who are members of self-help group completed the questionnaire and considered for the study. The study is non-experimental and survey-based, with no interventions or manipulations involved. In line with ethical guidelines, we obtained informed consent directly from each respondent before their participation. Conclusion The path coefficient values, t-statistics and P-Values confirmed the positive relationship between PSS->LS; PSS->SE & SE->LS in women self-group members. PLS structural equation modelling estimated by the bootstrap method revealed that SE partially mediates the relationship between PSS & LS. With regard to the interaction effect, the slope analysis and f2 effect size confirmed the moderating effect of EC in the relationship between PSS -> LS & SE -> LS.

                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-100/v1?src=rss">Optimizing machine learning performance for medical imaging analyses in low-resource environments: The prospects of CNN-based Feature Extractors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Machine learning (ML) algorithms have generally enhanced the speed and accuracy of image-based diagnosis, and treatment strategy planning, compared to the traditional approach of interpreting medical images by experienced radiologists. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly useful in this regard. However, training CNNs come with significant time and computational cost necessitating the development of efficient solutions for deploying CNNs in low-resource environments. This study investigates the use of pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors in medical imaging analyses and highlights the key considerations to be taken into account when implementing these extractors. Methods Eight medical imaging datasets covering several diseases (e.g. breast cancer, brain tumor and malaria) were used. Five ML algorithms (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forests and light gradient boosting machine) were implemented with three pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50). These pre-trained models were deployed as feature extractors fed into the classifiers for image classification tasks. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using a ten-fold cross validation scheme with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, time and space complexities. Results From our experiments, we found a general improvement in ML models’ performance after feature extraction (FE). Of the three FE models tested,EfficientNet-B0 performed best in terms of predicitve performance i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, MCC, F1 score, and precision. However, VGG-16 had the best performance in terms of time and memory efficiency. Our results identify two conditions necessary for the optimal performance of the FE models; (i) balanced datasets - a set where classes or categories are represented in approximately equal proportions, (ii) big data sets - adequate number of objects for training and testing. Interestingly, the performance of the ML models did not correlate with the number of class labels i.e. the type of classification task whether binary or multi-class had no influence in the models’ performance. Of the five algorithms investigated, logistic regression benefitted the most from the adoption of the feature extractors. Conclusion Our results confirm that the use of CNNs as feature extractors offer an effective balance between high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for use in low-resource environments.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <p>by Jiang Mao, Constantin A Rothkopf, Alan A Stocker</p>

Sensory neurons continually adapt their response characteristics according to recent stimulus history. However, it is unclear how such a reactive process can benefit the organism. Here, we test the hypothesis that adaptation actually acts proactively in the sense that it optimally adjusts sensory encoding for future stimuli. We first quantified human subjects’ ability to discriminate visual orientation under different adaptation conditions. Using an information theoretic analysis, we found that adaptation leads to a reallocation of coding resources such that encoding accuracy peaks at the mean orientation of the adaptor while total coding capacity remains constant. We then asked whether this characteristic change in encoding accuracy is predicted by the temporal statistics of natural visual input. Analyzing the retinal input of freely behaving human subjects showed that the distribution of local visual orientations in the retinal input stream indeed peaks at the mean orientation of the preceding input history (i.e., the adaptor). We further tested our hypothesis by analyzing the internal sensory representations of a recurrent neural network trained to predict the next frame of natural scene videos (PredNet). Simulating our human adaptation experiment with PredNet, we found that the network exhibited the same change in encoding accuracy as observed in human subjects. Taken together, our results suggest that adaptation-induced changes in encoding accuracy prepare the visual system for future stimuli.

                <p>by Natalie R. Davidson, Fan Zhang, Casey S. Greene</p>

While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI’s performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.

                <p>Biallelic variants in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class G (<i>PIGG</i>) cause hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebellar features. We present 8 patients from 6 families with a childhood-onset motor neuropathy and neurophysiology demonstrating variable motor conduction block and temporal dispersion. All individuals had a childhood onset tremor, 5 of 8 had cerebellar involvement, and 6 of 8 had childhood febrile seizures. All individuals have biallelic <i>PIGG</i> variants, including the previously reported pathogenic variant Trp505*, plus 6 novel variants. Null enzyme activity is demonstrated via <i>PIGO</i>/<i>PIGG</i> double knockout system for Val339Gly and Gly19Glu, and residual activity for Trp505* due to read-through. Emm negative blood group status was confirmed in 1 family. <i>PIGG</i> should be considered in unsolved motor neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:388–396</p>

                <p>Mutations in colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) result in CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD). Our previous study demonstrated a proteolytic generation of a soluble CSF1R (sCSF1R) that could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker of CSF1R-RD. Herein, we observed that sCSF1R is released into peripheral serum as a highly glycosylated monomer in <i>Csf1r</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice that mimic the clinical symptoms of CSF1R-RD patients. Notably, we found that serum sCSF1R could distinguish CSF1R-RD cohorts from controls with high accuracy as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27105?af=R">A Prospective Multicenter Analysis of Mobile Stroke Unit Cost‐Effectiveness</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Given the high disease and cost burden of ischemic stroke, evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of new approaches to prevent and treat ischemic stroke is critical. Effective ischemic stroke management depends on timely administration of thrombolytics after stroke onset. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness associated with the use of mobile stroke units (MSUs) to expedite tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, as compared with standard management through emergency medical services (EMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study is a prospective, multicenter, alternating-week, cluster-controlled trial of MSU versus EMS. One-year and life-time cost-effectiveness analyses, using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) method, were performed from the perspective of CMS's Medicare. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using patient-reported EQ-5D-5L data were used as the effectiveness measure. Health care utilizations were converted to costs using average national Medicare reimbursements. ICERs excluding patients with pre-existing disability, and limited to stroke-related costs were also calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first-year ICER for all tPA-eligible patients using total cost differences between MSU and EMS groups was $238,873/QALY; for patients without pre-existing disability was $61,199/QALY. The lifetime ICERs for all tPA-eligible patients and for those without pre-existing disability were $94,710 and $31,259/QALY, respectively. All ICERs were lower when restricted to stroke-related costs and were highly dependent on the number of patients treated per year in an MSU.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MSUs' cost-effectiveness is borderline if we consider total first-year costs and outcomes in all tPA-eligible patients. MSUs are cost-effective to highly cost-effective when calculations are based on patients without pre-existing disability, patients' lifetime horizon, stroke-related costs, and more patients treated per year in an MSU.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:259–269</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:270–280</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:281–295</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:296–312</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27119?af=R">Cost‐Effectiveness of Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH−) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to baseline, EtOH+ but not EtOH− patients had a statistically significant improvement in LD symptoms following sodium oxybate versus placebo (EtOH+: 98.75% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6–26.9; <i>p</i> = 0.008; EtOH−: 98.75% CI = −6.2 to 18.7; <i>p</i> = 0.42). Statistically significant minimum drug efficacy in EtOH+ patients was found at ≥16% symptom improvement (OR = 2.09; 98.75% CI = 0.75–5.80; <i>p</i> = 0.036), with an average of 40.81% benefits (98.75% CI = 34.7–48.6). Drug efficacy waned by 300 minutes after intake without a rebound. No changes were found in cognitive function, suicidality, or vital signs. Common adverse events included mild dizziness, nausea, and daytime sleepiness.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sodium oxybate showed clinically meaningful improvement of symptoms in EtOH+ LD patients, with acceptable tolerability. Sodium oxybate offers the first pathophysiologically relevant oral treatment for laryngeal dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:329–343</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27123?af=R">Sex Modifies the Severity and Outcome of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The limited existing evidence on sex differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with spontaneous, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) comes from small, single-center studies. Here, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials and 1 multi-ethnic observational study of ICH to investigate the impact of sex on ICH severity and outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria in our study were a neuroimaging-confirmed ICH. We evaluated whether sex was associated with ICH severity (hematoma volume and expansion) and poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale &gt;3) 3 or 6 months after the ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 4,812 ICH patients were evaluated (mean age 62, 40% female). Males with ICH were younger, more likely to be smokers and have diabetes, and less likely to be on anticoagulants (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In multivariable analyses, male sex was associated with non-lobar location (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.39–1.92]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), larger hemorrhages (beta: 0.16 [0.08–0.23]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and a higher risk of hematoma expansion (OR: 1.43 [1.20–1.71]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite the larger hemorrhage volume and higher risk of expansion, male sex was associated with a 24% lower risk of poor outcomes (OR: 0.76 [0.64–0.90]; <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to females, males with ICH have larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion. Despite the larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion, males with ICH have lower risk of poor outcomes. Our results suggest that the biology and clinical trajectory are different in females and males with ICH, supporting sex-specific research in this condition.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27129?af=R">Distinct Constructs Underlie Patient‐Reported and Performance‐Rated Outcomes after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture patients' perspectives on the consequences of health and disease, are widely used in neurological care and research. However, it is unclear how PROMs relate to performance-rated impairments. Sociodemographic factors are known to affect PROMs. Direct damage to brain regions critical for self-awareness (i.e., parietal regions and the salience/ventral-attention network) may also impair self-report outcomes. This study examined the relationship between PROMs and performance-based measures in stroke survivors with arm motor impairments. We hypothesized that PROMs would be distinct from performance-based outcomes, influenced by sociodemographic factors, and linked to damage in brain circuits involved in self-perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed 54 stroke survivors using patient-reported and performance-rated measures at 4 timepoints. We used factor analysis to reveal the outcome battery's factorial structure. Linear regression examined the association between classes of measures and sociodemographics. Voxel-lesion-symptom-mapping, region-of-interest-based analysis, and voxel-lesion-network-mapping investigated the relationship between classes of outcomes and stroke-related injury.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Performance-based and patient-reported measures formed distinct factors, consistent across recovery phases. Higher education (β1 = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and income adequacy (β2 = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.05) were associated with patient-reported, but not performance-rated outcomes. Greater parietal lobe injury, irrespective of hemisphere, was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes; greater corticospinal tract injury related to worse performance-rated outcomes. Lesions with greater functional connectivity to the salience/ventral-attention network were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (<i>r</i> = −0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings reveal important differences between performance-rated and patient-reported outcomes, each with specific associated factors and anatomy post-stroke. Incorporating sociodemographic and neuroanatomic characteristics into neurorehabilitation strategies may inform and optimize patient outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:242–253</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The effects of seizure control on outcomes in persons with dementia (PWD) remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of seizure control on mortality, function, cognition, and mood among PWD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This longitudinal, multicenter study is based on 39 Alzheimer's disease centers (ADCs) in the United States from September 2005 to December 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into recurrent (seizures in the past year), remote (prior seizures but none in the past year), and no seizures (controls). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among seizure groups. We used Weibull survival analysis to assess the mortality risks by seizure status after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, degree of cognitive impairment, dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation, brain trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, and depression. Cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating), function (physical dependence and nursing home residence), day-to-day activities (Functional Assessment Scores), and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale) were compared among seizure groups after adjusting for dementia duration and age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 26,501 participants, 374 (1.4%) had recurrent seizures and 510 (1.9%) had remote seizures. In multivariable survival analysis, recurrent seizures were associated with a higher mortality risk than remote and no seizures (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; recurrent aHR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51 to 2.12; remote aHR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.38). Median time-to-death for recurrent, remote, and no seizures was 2.4, 4.0, and 4.7 years, respectively. People with recurrent seizures had worse cognition, day-to-day function, and physical dependence than those with remote seizures and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PWD with poorly controlled recurrent seizures have worse mortality, functional, and cognitive outcomes than PWD with remote and no seizures. These findings underscore the need for timely identification and management of ongoing seizures in PWD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:358–368</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) in post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients across the adult lifespan.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-99/v1?src=rss">Predicting determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithm: Evidence from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Survey 2019 dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Globally, around 40% of women report unintended pregnancies, with approximately 214 million women in developing countries wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using any contraception. Modern contraceptives (MCs) are effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, controlling rapid population growth, and reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. Low use of contraceptives is responsible for the high fertility and maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan African nations like Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of modern contraceptive use among Ethiopian women of reproductive age using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methodology The study utilized secondary data from the 2019 Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Ethiopia survey, analyzing 8,837 samples. Preprocessing steps included data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and splitting the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the algorithms. Six supervised ML algorithms were employed and assessed using confusion matrices, with information gain applied to identify critical attributes for predicting MC use. Results Only 24% of participants used modern contraceptives {95% CI (23.1%, 24.9%). Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (81.97%, 95% CI {79.06%, 82.7%}) and area under the ROC curve (76.63%), followed by logistic regression (80.52%) and support vector machines (80.41%). Key determinants of MC use included starting family planning at age 20 or older, being single, having partner approval, being the wife of the household head, age between 36–49 years, advice from healthcare providers, concerns about side effects, and having a household size of five or more. Conclusion and Recommendations The use of modern contraceptives among Ethiopian women remains low. Extreme gradient boosting proved most effective in predicting determinants of MC use. Improved counseling during ANC/PNC visits, promoting partner discussions on family planning, and addressing concerns about family size and contraceptive use are recommended strategies to enhance MC uptake.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27182?af=R">Clinical Relevance of ‘Cap’ and ‘Track’ Development after Recent Small Subcortical Infarct</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI), some patients develop perilesional or remote hyperintensities (‘caps/tracks’) to the index infarct on T2/FLAIR MRI. However, their clinical relevance remains unclear. We investigated the clinicoradiological correlates of ‘caps/tracks’, and their impact on long-term outcomes following RSSI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified participants with lacunar stroke and MRI-confirmed RSSI from 3 prospective studies. At baseline, we collected risk factors, RSSI characteristics, small vessel disease (SVD) features, and microstructural integrity on diffusion imaging. Over 1-year, we repeated MRI and recorded ‘caps/tracks’ blinded to other data. We evaluated predictors of ‘caps/tracks’, and their association with 1-year functional (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2), mobility (Timed Up-and-Go), cognitive outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score &lt;26), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/incident infarct) using multivariable regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 185 participants, 93 (50.3%) developed ‘caps/tracks’ first detected at median 198 days after stroke. ‘Caps/tracks’ were independently predicted by baseline factors: larger RSSI, RSSI located in white matter, higher SVD score, and higher mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.15 [1.07–1.25], 6.01 [2.80–13.57], 1.77 [1.31–2.44], 1.42 [1.01–2.03]). At 1 year, ‘cap/track’ formation was associated with worse functional outcome (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.28–8.22), slower gait speed (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01–0.25), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.05–4.02), but not with cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>‘Caps/tracks’ after RSSI are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and may reflect vulnerability to progressive SVD-related injury. Reducing ‘caps/tracks’ may offer early efficacy markers in trials aiming to improve outcome after lacunar stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95273">Unbiased identification of cell identity in dense mixed neural cultures</a></h4>

              
                Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology is revolutionizing cell biology. However, the variability between individual iPSC lines and the lack of efficient technology to comprehensively characterize iPSC-derived cell types hinder its adoption in routine preclinical screening settings. To facilitate the validation of iPSC-derived cell culture composition, we have implemented an imaging assay based on cell painting and convolutional neural networks to recognize cell types in dense and mixed cultures with high fidelity. We have benchmarked our approach using pure and mixed cultures of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines and attained a classification accuracy above 96%. Through iterative data erosion, we found that inputs containing the nuclear region of interest and its close environment, allow achieving equally high classification accuracy as inputs containing the whole cell for semi-confluent cultures and preserved prediction accuracy even in very dense cultures. We then applied this regionally restricted cell profiling approach to evaluate the differentiation status of iPSC-derived neural cultures, by determining the ratio of postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors. We found that the cell-based prediction significantly outperformed an approach in which the population-level time in culture was used as a classification criterion (96% <i>vs</i> 86%, respectively). In mixed iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, microglia could be unequivocally discriminated from neurons, regardless of their reactivity state, and a tiered strategy allowed for further distinguishing activated from non-activated cell states, albeit with lower accuracy. Thus, morphological single-cell profiling provides a means to quantify cell composition in complex mixed neural cultures and holds promise for use in the quality control of iPSC-derived cell culture models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102440">Evaluating the transcriptional regulators of arterial gene expression via a catalogue of characterized arterial enhancers</a></h4>

              
                The establishment and growth of the arterial endothelium requires the coordinated expression of numerous genes. However, regulation of this process is not yet fully understood. Here, we combined <i>in silico</i> analysis with transgenic mice and zebrafish models to characterize arterial-specific enhancers associated with eight key arterial identity genes (<i>Acvrl1</i>/<i>Alk1</i>,<i> Cxcr4, Cxcl12, Efnb2, Gja4/Cx37, Gja5/Cx40</i>,<i> Nrp1</i> and <i>Unc5b)</i>. Next, to elucidate the regulatory pathways upstream of arterial gene transcription, we investigated the transcription factors binding each arterial enhancer compared to a similar assessment of non-arterial endothelial enhancers. These results found that binding of SOXF and ETS factors was a common occurrence at both arterial and pan-endothelial enhancers, suggesting neither are sufficient to direct arterial specificity. Conversely, FOX motifs independent of ETS motifs were over-represented at arterial enhancers. Further, MEF2 and RBPJ binding was enriched but not ubiquitous at arterial enhancers, potentially linked to specific patterns of behaviour within the arterial endothelium. Lastly, there was no shared or arterial-specific signature for WNT-associated TCF/LEF, TGFβ/BMP-associated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3, shear stress-associated KLF4 or venous-enriched NR2F2. This cohort of well characterized and in vivo-verified enhancers can now provide a platform for future studies into the interaction of different transcriptional and signalling pathways with arterial gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102618">Realistic mossy fiber input patterns to unipolar brush cells evoke a continuum of temporal responses comprised of components mediated by different glutamate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that receive mossy fiber (MF) inputs and excite granule cells. The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here, we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95485">CausalXtract, a flexible pipeline to extract causal effects from live-cell time-lapse imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amounts of time-lapse images of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions. However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects. Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell–cell interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer-associated fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anticancer treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.

                The specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling or metabolic cues, remains unresolved. Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98409">Altering the redox status of Chlamydia trachomatis directly impacts its developmental cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <i>ahpC</i> would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. Therefore, we created <i>ahpC</i> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <i>ahpC</i> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.

	<p>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by early postural instability and gait dysfunction, with frequent falls. Rehabilitation is an important therapeutic approach for motor dysfunction in patients with PSP. However, no conclusions have yet been drawn regarding the beneficial effects of rehabilitation in PSP, including the optimal duration of rehabilitation and differences in treatment effects among PSP subtypes. Herein, we investigated the effects of short-term rehabilitation and separately analyzed the effects on patients with PSP-Richardson&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (RS) and PSP-progressive gait freezing (PGF). Methods: The participants underwent several therapeutic exercise programs individualized for each participant, performed over 2 weeks. Analysis was performed on 25 patients with PSP-RS and eight with PSP-PGF. Results: Short-term rehabilitation improved the Berg Balance Scale score in both the PSP-RS and PSP-PGF groups, step length on the symptom-dominant side in PSP-RS, the coefficient of variation of step length on the symptom-dominant side, and the stance phase of the Symmetry Index in PSP-PGF. Conclusions: Overall, this 2-week short-term rehabilitation intervention was shown to have beneficial effects on balance in patients with PSP-RS and PSP-PGF.</p>

	<p>Background/Aim: Currently, there are limited evidence-based protocols for improving upper extremity (UE) motor function after stroke. The Keys protocol, a distributed form of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), delivers CIMT components in fewer hours per day over an extended period, fitting outpatient rehabilitation schedules and third-party payor models. This pilot study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the Keys protocol in enhancing UE capacity and performance poststroke. Methods: Ten adults with chronic stroke (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) participated in an 8-week intervention. The protocol included 22 supervised training sessions (1.5 h each): 4 days/week for 4 weeks, 2 days/week for weeks 5&amp;amp;ndash;6, and 1 day/week for weeks 7&amp;amp;ndash;8. Participants wore a restraint mitt on the less-affected UE during waking hours and used an adapted transfer package. Outcome measures included the Motor Activity Log (MAL), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and Zung Depression Scale, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (4 weeks), and posttreatment. Results: Significant improvements were observed in SIS Strength, ADLs/IADLs, Mobility, and Hand Function domains, exceeding MCID thresholds. Memory and Communication domains improved significantly at the 3-month follow-up. WMFT performance times improved, with fewer incomplete tasks. MAL scores for Amount of Use and Quality of Movement increased across all time points. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment. Conclusions: The Keys protocol effectively improves UE use, motor function, mood, and quality of life, with the greatest gains observed mid-intervention. These findings support its feasibility and potential for outpatient stroke rehabilitation (ClinicalTrials.gov Registration: NCT05311384).</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Loneliness is a heterogeneous phenomenon, generally defined as an emotional experience based on the perceived distance between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual social relationships and those he or she would like to have. Adolescence is particularly vulnerable to loneliness because of the many changes in values, feelings, and emotions that characterize it. Among the aspects that may influence this feeling of discomfort, the literature identifies maladaptive personality and a dysfunctional response to traumatic events. Our study aims to identify the possible role that maladaptive personality traits and post-traumatic stress symptomatology in the form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Disturbance in Self-Organization (DSO) may play in the perception of loneliness in adolescents: Methods: We identified a mediation model constructed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test PTSD and DSO post-traumatic stress symptomatology as independent variables and maladaptive personality as a mediator in the relationship between these and perceptions of loneliness in a population of adolescents of both sexes, Italian high school students; Results: Our study identifies the significant role of PTSD and DSO symptomatology in influencing the state of loneliness, both directly and indirectly through maladaptive personality traits, which appear to exert a substantial influence on the perception of loneliness, potentially functioning as mediators in the relationship between the latter and PTSD/DSO symptomatology. Presumably, a maladaptive personality may complicate recovery from adverse and traumatic experiences by preventing the implementation of functional coping strategies and promoting dysfunctional responses. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of researchers and clinicians adequately considering different personality traits and the early identification of post-traumatic stress symptomatology. A focus on adolescents&amp;amp;rsquo; communication and interpersonal skills and their ability to respond effectively to stressful and traumatic events may prove useful in identifying more effective strategies for preventing and managing loneliness and related distress in adolescents.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study analyzed the effects of parachute jump stress on the executive functions and attention of cadets. Executive functions, which includes processes such as attentional control and cognitive flexibility, are crucial for soldiers, especially in situations requiring rapid decision-making. Parachute jumping, as an intense stressor, mobilizes cognitive resources, which can lead to short-term improvements in executive functions. Methods: A total of 64 cadets divided into control (N = 32) and experimental (N = 32) groups participated in the study. The experimental group performed a parachute jump and then took the Color Trails Test, assessed both before and after the jump. Results: The results showed significant improvements in executive functions, in particular, sustained and alternating attention, sequential information processing, and monitoring one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own behavior, suggesting a positive effect of stress on selected executive functions. Conclusions: The results indicate that intense, short-term stress can positively affect executive functions, although this effect may depend on the type of task and the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; experience of exposure to intense stressful stimuli. The study makes an important contribution to the design of future military training, considering the importance of mobilizing cognitive resources in response to short-term stress.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Charcot first described ALS in 1869, but the specific mechanisms that mediate the disease pathology are still not clear. Intense research efforts have provided insight into unique neuroanatomical regions, specific neuronal populations and genetic associations for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases; however, the experimental results also suggest a convergence of these events to common toxic pathways. We propose that common toxic pathways can be therapeutically targeted, and this intervention will be effective in slowing progression and improving patient quality of life. Here, we focus on understanding the role of IL6 trans-signaling in ALS disease processes. Methods: We leveraged unique mouse models of IL6 trans-signaling that we developed that recapitulate the production of active sIL6R in a genotypic and quantitative fashion observed in humans. Given that the SOD1 transgenic mouse is one of the most highly studied and characterized models of ALS, we bred SOD1G93A mice with IL6R trans-signaling mice to determine how enhanced trans-signaling influenced symptom onset and pathological processes, including neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, glial activation and motoneuron (MN) survival. Results: The results indicate that in animals with enhanced trans-signaling, symptom onset and pathological processes were accelerated, suggesting a role in disease modification. Administration of an IL6R functional blocking antibody failed to alter accelerated symptom onset and disease progression. Conclusions: Future work to investigate the site-specific influence of enhanced IL6 trans-signaling and the tissue-specific bioavailability of potential therapeutics will be necessary to identify targets for precise therapeutic interventions that may limit disease progression in the 60% of ALS patients who inherit the common Il6R Asp358Ala variant.</p>

	<p>The assessment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia has advanced since the 2006 NIMH-MATRICS Consensus Statement, leading to the development of second-generation rating scales like the Brief Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms. These scales address the limitations of first-generation tools, such as the inclusion of aspects that are not negative symptoms and the lack of assessment of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s internal experience. However, psychometric validation of these scales is still in progress, and they are not yet recommended by regulatory agencies, thus limiting their use in clinical trials and settings. Complementing these traditional methods, remote digital phenotyping offers a novel approach by leveraging smartphones and wearable technology to capture real-time, high-resolution clinical data. Despite the potential to overcome traditional assessment barriers, challenges remain in aligning these digital measures with clinical ratings and ensuring data security. Equally important is patient acceptance, as the success of remote digital phenotyping relies on the willingness of patients to use these technologies. This review provides a critical overview of both second-generation scales and remote digital phenotyping for assessing negative symptoms, highlighting future research needs.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal brain injury is a leading cause of developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy. However, further work is needed to understand early brain development in the presence of brain injury. In this case report, we examine the longitudinal neuromotor development of a term infant following a significant loss of right-hemispheric brain tissue due to a unilateral ischemic stroke. Our analysis focuses on the integrity and development of the corticospinal tract (CST) from the lesioned hemisphere. This case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate CST development after loss of the majority of the motor cortex. Methods: Evaluations were conducted when the infant was 4 (Visit-1), 18 (Visit 2), and 25 (Visit 3) months old. Assessments included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the lesion and quantify CST structural integrity, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to evaluate CST functional circuitry, and neuromotor assessments. Results: At Visit 1, bilateral CSTs were identified through diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) despite an estimated loss of 92.7% (7.3% retained) of age-typical motor cortex from the right hemisphere. Both hemispheres exhibited bilateral motor-evoked potential in response to stimulation with spTMS, which remained when reassessed at Visits 2 and 3. Longitudinal MRI showed distinct developmental trajectories of CST integrity in each hemisphere, with the lesioned hemisphere exhibiting initial increases in integrity between Visits 1 and 2 followed by a decrease in integrity between Visits 2 and 3. The non-lesioned hemisphere showed increased integrity from Visit 1 to Visit 2, which remained stable at Visit 3. Motor assessments at all visits indicated a high risk of cerebral palsy. Conclusions: This report highlights the utility of MRI and spTMS in studying neuromotor development. The findings reveal preserved functional bilateral CST circuitry despite majority loss of the right-hemispheric motor cortex as well as distinct developmental trajectories in CST integrity between hemispheres. These results underscore the potential for neural plasticity after perinatal brain injury. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT05013736.</p>

	<p>The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been developed and edited by the World Health Organisation and represents the global standard for recording health information and causes of death. The ICD-11 is the eleventh revision and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Perceptual disturbances refer to abnormalities in the way sensory information is interpreted by the brain, leading to distortions in the perception of reality. These can manifest as distorted perceptions or as phantom perceptions and can occur in all sensory modalities as visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory tactile, vestibular, proprioceptory or interoceptory disturbances. There are similar brain mechanisms involved in the generation of these analogous perceptual disturbances and disorders, and they are treated with similar approaches. Perceptual disturbances are highly prevalent, with large variations across the different sensory modalities. They can be associated with significant suffering and cause a high socioeconomic burden. Perceptual disturbances can be symptoms of another disease or disease entities on their own. In the context of pain, this is reflected by the distinction between secondary pain (pain as a symptom of another underlying condition) and primary pain (a disease in its own right, rather than being a symptom of another underlying condition) in the ICD-11. Such a clear distinction is not found in an entirely consistent way across the various sensory modalities. By using the example of auditory phantom perceptions, we propose a framework for the classification of sensory disorders in alignment with the classification of pain in the ICD-11. The descriptions of the sensory disturbances should include (1) a causal aspect (primary versus secondary), (2) a temporal aspect (acute vs. chronic and persistent vs. intermittent), (3) a cognitive, emotional and autonomic interpretation aspect (=suffering) and (4) a social aspect (=disability). If the latter two aspects are present, we propose that the sensory disturbance is called a sensory disorder.</p>

                <p>Short-term motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics has been shown to involve at least two concurrent learning processes: a slow process that responds weakly to error but retains information well and a fast process that responds strongly to error but has poor retention. This modeling framework can explain several properties of motion-dependent motor adaptation (e.g., 24&nbsp;h retention). An important assumption of this computational framework is that learning is only based on the experienced movement error, and the effect of noise (either internally generated or externally applied) is not considered. We examined the respective error sensitivity by quantifying adaptation in three subject groups distinguished by the noise added to the motion-dependent perturbation. We assessed the feedforward adaptive changes in motor output and examined the adaptation rate, retention, and decay of learning. Applying a two-state modeling framework showed that the applied noise during training mainly affected the fast learning process, with the slow process largely unaffected; participants in the higher noise groups demonstrated a reduced force profile following training, but the decay rate across groups was similar, suggesting that the slow process was unimpaired across conditions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that noise significantly decreases motor adaptation, but this reduction may be due to its influence over specific learning mechanisms. Importantly, this may have implications for how the motor system compensates for random fluctuations, especially when affected by brain disorders that result in movement tremor (e.g., essential tremor).</p>

                <p>Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, significantly impacts patient quality of life. Current classification methods focus primarily on clinical observations and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, often overlooking the underlying dynamics driving seizures. This study uses surface EEG data to identify seizure transitions using a dynamical systems&ndash;based framework&mdash;the taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes&mdash;previously examined only in invasive data. We applied principal component and independent component (IC) analysis to surface EEG recordings from 1,177 seizures in 158 patients with focal epilepsy, decomposing the signals into ICs. The ICs were visually labeled for clear seizure transitions and bifurcation morphologies (BifMs), which were then examined using Bayesian multilevel modeling in the context of clinical factors. Our analysis reveals that certain onset bifurcations (saddle node on invariant circle and supercritical Hopf) are more prevalent during wakefulness compared with their reduced rate during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly NREM3. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of modeling approaches and suggest additional avenues to continue this exploration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating this classification process using machine learning, achieving high performance in identifying seizure-related ICs and classifying interspike interval changes. Our findings suggest that the noise in surface EEG may obscure certain BifMs, and we suggest technical improvements that could enhance detection accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating long-term biological rhythms, such as circadian and multiday cycles, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of seizure dynamics and improve clinical decision-making.</p>

                Background Studies assessing sub-maximal aerobic capacity in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate sub-maximal aerobic capacity in CHB patients compared to apparently healthy participants (control-group). Methods A 6-min walk test was performed. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, along with heart-rate, oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, and dyspnea ( ie ; visual analogue scale) at rest (Rest) and at the end (End) of the test. Additionally, 6-min walk work (6MWW), “6MWD × body mass index (BMI), “6MWD × SpO2End”, and “estimated cardiorespiratory and muscular chain age” were calculated. Signs of physical intolerance were determined including abnormal 6MWD ( ie ; 6MWD < lower limit of normal), chronotropic insufficiency ( ie ; heart-rateEnd < 60% of maximal predicted heart-rate), high dyspnea ( ie ; dyspneaEnd > 5), and desaturation ( ie ; drop in SpO2 > 5 points). Results Compared to the control-group (n=28), the CHB-group (n=26) exhibited significantly lower 6MWD by 61 meters (13%), lower 6MWW by 5266 m.kg, lower “6MWD × BMI” by 1498 m.kg/m2, lower “6MWD × SpO2End” by 5650%, and lower heart-rateEnd by 26 bpm (12% predicted). The CHB-group included higher percentages of participants with chronotropic insufficiency (23.08% vs. 3.57% in the CG) and abnormal 6MWD (34.61% vs. 3.57% in the CG). CHB accelerated the aging of the “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” by 11 years. Conclusion Non-cirrhotic CHB may contribute to reduced submaximal aerobic capacity and acceleration of “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” aging. A regular physical activity program could be a valuable intervention to mitigate these effects.

                Background This study explores the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on consumer purchasing decisions in the fashion industry. It examines how corporate image and word-of-mouth (WOM) mediate the relationship between ESG practices and consumer trust, impacting purchase intent. Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed online to 393 participants aware of ESG practices, targeting Generation Z consumers. The survey assessed demographics, ESG awareness, brand image, WOM, and purchasing decisions using a Likert scale across five constructs: ESG Practices, Corporate Image, WOM, Trust, and Purchase Intention. Data were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in IBM AMOS, following a two-step process: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for validation and path analysis for hypothesis testing. Results The findings indicate that ESG practices significantly enhance corporate image and positive WOM, which, in turn, foster consumer trust. Corporate image has a substantial impact on consumer trust (p < .001), while WOM also contributes to trust (p < .001). Trust was found to be a strong predictor of purchase intention, demonstrating the mediating role of corporate image and WOM between ESG practices and purchasing behavior. Conclusions ESG practices are critical in shaping consumer perceptions and fostering loyalty in the fashion sector. By building a trustworthy corporate image and encouraging positive WOM, fashion brands can effectively influence consumer purchasing decisions. This study highlights the competitive advantage of implementing ESG practices, particularly in appealing to Generation Z consumers who value sustainability and ethical business practices.

<p>Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activity in striatal and temporal clusters. Baseline neural stress responses could not predict the anxiety trajectory during a particular stress phase.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anxiety and depression disorders show high prevalence rates, and stress is a significant risk factor for both. However, studies investigating the interplay between anxiety, depression, and stress regulation in the brain are scarce. The present manuscript included 124 law students from the LawSTRESS project. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychosocial stress was induced with the imaging stress paradigm Scan<i>STRESS</i>. Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activation in striatal and temporal clusters. A bifactor model of the HADS suggested a general factor characterized by tension, nervousness, and cheerlessness, which was associated with activation changes in a similar but more circumscribed cluster than anxiety. In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS was assessed at five sampling points (1 year, 3 months, 1 week prior exam, 1 week, and 1 month thereafter), and thus an exploratory trajectory analysis could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across the sampling points. Our results suggest that—in healthy young participants—neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety, supporting the assumption that these regions are related to individual differences in vulnerability to stress-related disorders. A correlation with depression scores could not be found, and possible explanations are discussed.</p>

The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.

                <p>by Lua Koenig, Biyu J. He</p>

Perceptual awareness results from an intricate interaction between external sensory input and the brain’s spontaneous activity. Pre-stimulus ongoing activity influencing conscious perception includes both brain oscillations in the alpha (7 to 14 Hz) and beta (14 to 30 Hz) frequency ranges and aperiodic activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range. However, whether brain oscillations and SCPs independently influence conscious perception or do so through shared mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question in 2 independent magnetoencephalography (MEG) data sets involving near-threshold visual perception tasks in humans using low-level (Gabor patches) and high-level (objects, faces, houses, animals) stimuli, respectively. We found that oscillatory power and large-scale SCP activity influence conscious perception through independent mechanisms that do not have shared variance. In addition, through mediation analysis, we show that pre-stimulus oscillatory power and SCP activity have different relations to pupil size—an index of arousal—in their influences on conscious perception. Together, these findings suggest that oscillatory power and SCPs independently contribute to perceptual awareness, with distinct relations to pupil-linked arousal.

                Background Chronic diseases are a significant health concern in Australia. Understanding community preferences for health screening services is vital for enhancing service delivery. We conducted a study to determine community preferences for health screening services for chronic diseases in Australia using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). This paper aims to present the development of the final DCE design using priors estimated from a survey. Methods A DCE was conducted in Australia. An online survey was administered to a general Australian population over 18. The final attribute list of five attributes with three levels each was designed. A D-efficient design with 30 pair-wise choice tasks was developed using a fractional factorial design. A pre-test was conducted to assess comprehension and understanding of the online DCE survey. The pilot survey aimed to compute priors (i.e. coefficients) associated with attributes. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the pilot DCE data. Results The survey included 30 choice tasks in three blocks, with 119 participants responding. The best DCE design was selected based on D-error, with a lower D-error indicating the most efficient design. The pilot survey results indicated a strong preference for highly accurate screening tests, with coefficients for 85% and 95% accuracy being positive. Coefficients estimated from the pilot survey were used as priors to design the DCE choice tasks for the main survey. The final DCE design showed a notable improvement in the attribute level overlap compared to the design used for the pilot survey. Conclusions A rigorous approach was taken to develop a DCE survey that could effectively determine the preferences of the community for health screening services. The resulting DCE design consisted of 30 choice tasks presented in pairs and was deemed efficient enough to gather comprehensive information in the final survey.

                Background This study investigates the impact of the 2008 constitutional change on Ecuadorians´ life satisfaction (developing country), based on the Sumak-Kawsay or “The good way of living” philosophy, with a particular focus on caring of people and mingas (community participation). Methods Through a repeated cross-sectional analysis of national survey data, this study compares the periods before (2007) and after (2014) the implementation of the 2008 constitution to examine how caring behaviors and mingas (community work) influence life satisfaction, using an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the role of this reform in shaping these effects. Results The findings reveal significant improvements in life satisfaction following the 2008’ reform, especially in the Eastern region, where community activities are prevalent, and poverty is most concentrated. These activities, including mingas, showed a positive association with an increase in life satisfaction, underscoring the role of public policies in improving public well-being. Conclusion This approach offers innovative empirical evidence on how social public policies that promote prosocial behaviors, such as solidarity and community participation, can create an environment encouraging to greater life satisfaction, particularly in less developed regions. It also underscores how social investment aimed at improving wealth distribution can positively influence collaborative behaviors.

<p>Whereas a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is important for diagnosing epilepsy, a single routine EEG is limited in its diagnostic value.

We aim to demonstrate how network properties in EEG recordings can be used to improve the speed and accuracy differentiating epilepsy from mimics, such as functional seizures – even in the absence of IEDs.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, we analyzed routine scalp EEGs from 218 patients with suspected epilepsy and normal initial EEGs. The patients’ diagnoses were later confirmed based on an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission. About 46% ultimately being diagnosed with epilepsy and 54% with non-epileptic conditions. A logistic regression model was trained using spectral and network-derived EEG features to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epilepsy. Of the 218 patients, 90% were used for training and 10% were held out for testing. Within the training set, 10-fold cross validation was performed. The resulting tool was named “EpiScalp.”</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EpiScalp achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940, an accuracy of 0.904, a sensitivity of 0.835, and a specificity of 0.963 in classifying patients as having epilepsy or not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EpiScalp provides an accurate diagnostic aid from a single initial EEG recording, even in more challenging epilepsy cases with normal initial EEGs. This may represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy diagnosis by deriving an objective measure of epilepsy likelihood from previously uninformative EEGs. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
