              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0285-23.2024?rss=1">Targeted Memory Reactivation during Nonrapid Eye Movement Sleep Enhances Neutral, But Not Negative, Components of Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotionally salient components of memory are preferentially remembered at the expense of accompanying neutral information. This emotional memory trade-off is enhanced over time, and possibly sleep, through a process of memory consolidation. Sleep is believed to benefit memory through a process of reactivation during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Here, targeted memory reactivation (TMR) was used to manipulate the reactivation of negative and neutral memories during NREM sleep. Thirty-one male and female participants encoded composite scenes containing either a negative or neutral object superimposed on an always neutral background. During NREM sleep, sounds associated with the scene object were replayed, and memory for object and background components was tested the following morning. We found that TMR during NREM sleep improved memory for neutral, but not negative scene objects. This effect was associated with sleep spindle activity, with a larger spindle response following TMR cues predicting TMR effectiveness for neutral items only. These findings therefore do not suggest a role of NREM memory reactivation in enhancing the emotional memory trade-off across a 12&nbsp;h period but do align with growing evidence of spindle-mediated memory reactivation in service of neutral declarative memory.</p>

                <p>The Enhanced-Deep-Super-Resolution (EDSR) model is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network suitable for improving image spatial resolution. It was previously trained with general-purpose pictures and then, in this work, tested on biomedical magnetic resonance (MR) images, comparing the network outcomes with traditional up-sampling techniques. We explored possible changes in the model response when different MR sequences were analyzed. T<SUB>1</SUB>w and T<SUB>2</SUB>w MR brain images of 70 human healthy subjects (F:M, 40:30) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) repository were down-sampled and then up-sampled using EDSR model and BiCubic (BC) interpolation. Several reference metrics were used to quantitatively assess the performance of up-sampling operations (RMSE, pSNR, SSIM, and HFEN). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconstructions were evaluated. Different brain tissues were analyzed individually. The EDSR model was superior to BC interpolation on the selected metrics, both for two- and three- dimensional reconstructions. The reference metrics showed higher quality of EDSR over BC reconstructions for all the analyzed images, with a significant difference of all the criteria in T<SUB>1</SUB>w images and of the perception-based SSIM and HFEN in T<SUB>2</SUB>w images. The analysis per tissue highlights differences in EDSR performance related to the gray-level values, showing a relative lack of outperformance in reconstructing hyperintense areas. The EDSR model, trained on general-purpose images, better reconstructs MR T<SUB>1</SUB>w and T<SUB>2</SUB>w images than BC, without any retraining or fine-tuning. These results highlight the excellent generalization ability of the network and lead to possible applications on other MR measurements.</p>

                Background A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods Seventeen girls’ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. Results Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. The levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmentally constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

                Background Co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an impact on high HBV replication and progression to liver cancer. These may lead to cross-resistance of drugs due to therapeutic pressure or liver toxicity. These require continuous monitoring of HBV variants for better diagnosis and treatment strategies. Methods Convenience sampling was used to collect fifty archival sera from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. The Sera were subjected to HBsAg screening using ELISA, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, phylogenetic and mutation analysis. A correlation test was performed to measure the association between polymerase and surface mutations. Results Of the 50 samples, 86% (N= 43/50) were HBsAg positive; 82% (N=41/50) PCR positive and 92% (N=38/41) sequenced. The HBV sequences showed similarity to genotype A (73% [N=19/26]) and (24% [N=7/26]) as genotypes B, C, D, E, F, and G. Prevalence of the mutations in the Surface region was (47% [N=18/38]); including diagnostic failure (K122R and T143S) and vaccines escape mutations (P127T, G145R, S207N, Y200T, E164D, Y206H and L209V). The mutations in the RT was at (36% [N=14/38]) with drug resistance mutations (DRM) at (50% [7/14]). Mutations showed resistance to lamivudine (LMV) at (35% [5/14]), telbivudine (LdT) at (29% [4/14]), (14% [2/14]) for entecavir (ETV) and (21% [3/14]) for adefovir (ADV). One sample had a combination of L180M, M204V, S202K, and M250I mutations. There was no statistical significance between S and RT mutations at P>0.005 and the statistical correlation between RT and SHB mutations was weak at 0.877. Conclusions Our findings highlight the prevalence of HBV genotype A in HIV-infected patients in South Africa. We provide evidence of mutations linked to immune evasion and drug resistance. Mutations have no statistical significance but can have clinical Implication on the diagnosis and treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals.

Questionnaires will be distributed on the spot to patients and phone interviews for distant patients will be conducted using an interview checklist. Discussion The study is expected to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge by delving into specific challenges and experiences of breast cancer survivors post-radiotherapy, particularly within the context of a rural healthcare setting. By concentrating on this group, the study will contribute to the body of existing knowledge by offering a deeper view of the variables influencing the quality of life in breast cancer survivors. The knowledge gathered from this research will be extremely helpful in understanding the complex effects of radiation therapy on the physical, psychological, and social aspects of survivors’ quality of life.

Neural responses in visual cortex adapt to prolonged and repeated stimuli. While adaptation occurs across the visual cortex, it is unclear how adaptation patterns and computational mechanisms differ across the visual hierarchy. Here we characterize two signatures of short-term neural adaptation in time-varying intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data collected while participants viewed naturalistic image categories varying in duration and repetition interval. Ventral- and lateral-occipitotemporal cortex exhibit slower and prolonged adaptation to single stimuli and slower recovery from adaptation to repeated stimuli compared to V1-V3. For category-selective electrodes, recovery from adaptation is slower for preferred than non-preferred stimuli. To model neural adaptation we augment our delayed divisive normalization (DN) model by scaling the input strength as a function of stimulus category, enabling the model to accurately predict neural responses across multiple image categories. The model fits suggest that differences in adaptation patterns arise from slower normalization dynamics in higher visual areas interacting with differences in input strength resulting from category selectivity. Our results reveal systematic differences in temporal adaptation of neural population responses between lower and higher visual brain areas and show that a single computational model of history-dependent normalization dynamics, fit with area-specific parameters, accounts for these differences.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012071">The evolution of environmentally mediated social interactions and posthumous spite under isolation by distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles Mullon, Jorge Peña, Laurent Lehmann</p>

Many social interactions happen indirectly via modifications of the environment, e.g. through the secretion of functional compounds or the depletion of renewable resources. Here, we derive the selection gradient on a quantitative trait affecting dynamical environmental variables that feed back on reproduction and survival in a finite patch-structured population subject to isolation by distance. Our analysis shows that the selection gradient depends on how a focal individual influences the fitness of all future individuals in the population through modifications of the environmental variables they experience, weighted by the neutral relatedness between recipients and the focal. The evolutionarily relevant trait-driven environmental modifications are formalized as the extended phenotypic effects of an individual, quantifying how a trait change in an individual in the present affects the environmental variables in all patches at all future times. When the trait affects reproduction and survival through a payoff function, the selection gradient can be expressed in terms of extended phenotypic effects weighted by scaled relatedness. We show how to compute extended phenotypic effects, relatedness, and scaled relatedness using Fourier analysis, which allow us to investigate a broad class of environmentally mediated social interactions in a tractable way. We use our approach to study the evolution of a trait controlling the costly production of some lasting commons (e.g. a common-pool resource or a toxic compound) that can diffuse in space and persist in time. We show that indiscriminate posthumous spite readily evolves in this scenario. More generally, whether selection favours environmentally mediated altruism or spite is determined by the spatial correlation between an individual’s lineage and the commons originating from its patch. The sign of this correlation depends on interactions between dispersal patterns and the commons’ renewal dynamics. More broadly, we suggest that selection can favour a wide range of social behaviours when these have carry-over effects in space and time.

                <p>by Yahaya A Yabo, Dieter Henrik Heiland</p>

Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.

                <p>by Yatian Chen, Jiayue Gu, Biao Yang, Lili Yang, Jie Pang, Qinghua Luo, Yirong Li, Danyang Li, Zixin Deng, Changjiang Dong, Haohao Dong, Zhengyu Zhang</p>

The peptidoglycan (PG) layer is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall and serves as an important target for antibiotics in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The hydrolysis of septal PG (sPG) is a crucial step of bacterial cell division, facilitated by FtsEX through an amidase activation system. In this study, we present the cryo-EM structures of <i>Escherichia coli</i> FtsEX and FtsEX-EnvC in the ATP-bound state at resolutions of 3.05 Å and 3.11 Å, respectively. Our PG degradation assays in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> reveal that the ATP-bound conformation of FtsEX activates sPG hydrolysis of EnvC-AmiB, whereas EnvC-AmiB alone exhibits autoinhibition. Structural analyses indicate that ATP binding induces conformational changes in FtsEX-EnvC, leading to significant differences from the apo state. Furthermore, PG degradation assays of AmiB mutants confirm that the regulation of AmiB by FtsEX-EnvC is achieved through the interaction between EnvC-AmiB. These findings not only provide structural insight into the mechanism of sPG hydrolysis and bacterial cell division, but also have implications for the development of novel therapeutics targeting drug-resistant bacteria.

                <p>by Arianna Zuanazzi, Pablo Ripollés, Wy Ming Lin, Laura Gwilliams, Jean-Rémi King, David Poeppel</p>

Combinatoric linguistic operations underpin human language processes, but how meaning is composed and refined in the mind of the reader is not well understood. We address this puzzle by exploiting the ubiquitous function of negation. We track the online effects of negation (“not”) and intensifiers (“really”) on the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., “good”) in parametrically designed behavioral and neurophysiological (MEG) experiments. The behavioral data show that participants first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Decoding analyses of neural activity further reveal significant above chance decoding accuracy for negated adjectives within 600 ms from adjective onset, suggesting that negation does not invert the representation of adjectives (i.e., “not bad” represented as “good”); furthermore, decoding accuracy for negated adjectives is found to be significantly lower than that for affirmative adjectives. Overall, these results suggest that negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives. This putative suppression mechanism of negation is supported by increased synchronization of beta-band neural activity in sensorimotor areas. The analysis of negation provides a steppingstone to understand how the human brain represents changes of meaning over time.

The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas12a has become a powerful genome-editing tool in biomedical research due to its ease of use and low off-targeting. However, the size of Cas12a severely limits clinical applications such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy. Here, we characterized a novel compact Cas12a ortholog, termed EbCas12a, from the metagenome-assembled genome of a currently unclassified <i>Erysipelotrichia</i>. It has the PAM sequence of 5′-TTTV-3′ (V = A, G, C) and the smallest size of approximately 3.47 kb among the Cas12a orthologs reported so far. In addition, enhanced EbCas12a (enEbCas12a) was also designed to have comparable editing efficiency with higher specificity to AsCas12a and LbCas12a in mammalian cells at multiple target sites. Based on the compact enEbCas12a, an all-in-one AAV delivery system with crRNA for Cas12a was developed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Overall, the novel smallest high-fidelity enEbCas12a, this first case of the all-in-one AAV delivery for Cas12a could greatly boost future gene therapy and scientific research.

                <p>by Marlen C. Rice, Andrew J. Janik, Nels C. Elde, James A. Gagnon, Keir M. Balla</p>

Zebrafish are popular research organisms selected for laboratory use due in part to widespread availability from the pet trade. Many contemporary colonies of laboratory zebrafish are maintained in aquaculture facilities that monitor and aim to curb infections that can negatively affect colony health and confound experiments. The impact of laboratory control on the microbial constituents associated with zebrafish in research environments compared to the pet trade are unclear. Diseases of unknown causes are common in both environments. We conducted a metatranscriptomic survey to broadly compare the zebrafish-associated microbes in pet trade and laboratory environments. We detected many microbes in animals from the pet trade that were not found in laboratory animals. Cohousing experiments revealed several transmissible microbes including a newly described non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus in the Birnaviridae family we name Rocky Mountain birnavirus (RMBV). Infections were detected in asymptomatic animals from the pet trade, but when transmitted to laboratory animals RMBV was associated with pronounced antiviral responses and hemorrhagic disease. These experiments highlight the pet trade as a distinct source of diverse microbes that associate with zebrafish and establish a paradigm for the discovery of newly described pathogenic viruses and other infectious microbes that can be developed for study in the laboratory.

                Background Copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) ion release, and surface topography change from the orthodontic wire are the initial processes of corrosion that may affect the mechanical properties of the archwire. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of CHX, NaF, and chitosan on the corrosion of CuNiTi wire nickel and copper ions released, surface roughness change, and archwire deflection. Methods Ninety samples of CuNiTi Tanzo™ archwires were divided into five groups according to their immersion solution: Artificial Saliva, CHX, NaF, CHX-NaF, and chitosan group. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (n=6) corresponding immersion time, i.e., two, four, and six weeks. The corrosion of the samples was analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and universal testing machine (UTM). Results The amount of nickel ion releases was increasing, but the copper ion releases were reduced by the time of observations. The highest nickel ion was released in the CHX-NaF group and the lowest in the chitosan group for six-week immersion. It also corresponded to the surface topography by SEM analysis which showed the most extended cracks and deep pits in the CHX-NaF group and a smoother surface in the chitosan group. Copper ion release showed the highest ion release in the NaF group and the lowest release in the chitosan group. The unloading force of CuNiTi archwire deflection remains the same at week two and week four for all mouthwashes. Conclusion The use of mouthwashes that contained CHX, NaF, and chitosan could further alter the passive layer and cause higher nickel and copper ion release and increased CuNiTi archwire surface structure porosity. But there is no distinction between mouthwashes to release the unloading force within two until four weeks.

                Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are well-recognised antidiabetic medications among clinicians due to its highly protective effects on cardiovascular and renal systems on diabetic patients. However, one of its uncommonly reported side effects is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) which is characterized by mild hyperglycemia, ketosis and acidosis. Chest pain as a clinical presentation of EuDKA has been rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of a 46-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia presented to the hospital with central chest pain that radiates to the back and is associated with mild shortness of breath and one bout of vomiting. She had been taking dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for four years. She was found to have a blood glucose level of 7 mmol\L, high anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonuria. Toxicology screening was unremarkable. She was diagnosed as a case of SGLT2-induced EuDKA and was treated with fluid, insulin and potassium chloride (KCL). Her hospital course went smoothly. Dapagloflzi was discontinued, and she was discharged home on oral metformin and subcutaneous insulin. This study highlights the rare occurance of chest pain as a presentation of EuDKA, an uncommon side effect of the widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. Chest pain in patients using SGLT2 Inhibitors should raise the clinician’s suspicion for possible EuDKA.

                Chronic respiratory diseases often necessitate lung transplantation due to irreversible damage. Organ engineering offers hope through stem cell-based organ generation. However, the crucial sterilization step in scaffold preparation poses challenges. This study conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the extracellular matrix (ECM) conditions of decellularised lungs subjected to different sterilisation processes. A search was performed for articles published in the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and SciELO databases according to the PRISMA guidelines. Overall, five articles that presented positive results regarding the effectiveness of the sterilisation process were selected, some of which identified functional damage in the ECM. Was possible concluded that regardless of the type of agent used, physical or chemical, all of them demonstrated that sterilisation somehow harms the ECM. An ideal protocol has not been found to be fully effective in the sterilisation of pulmonary scaffolds for use in tissue and/or organ engineering.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-553/v1?src=rss">The first complete mitochondrional genome of Anopheles gibbinsi using a skimming sequencing approach. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Anopheles are the only vectors of human malaria. Anopheles gibbinsi has been linked to malaria transmission in Kenya, with recent collections in Zambia reporting the mosquito species exhibiting zoophilic and exophilic behavioral patterns with occasional contact with humans. Given the paucity of genetic data, and challenges to identification and molecular taxonomy of the mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles genus; we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of An. gibbinsi using a genome skimming approach. An Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform was used for sequencing, the length of the mitochondrial genome was 15401 bp, with 78.5% AT content comprised of 37 genes. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood using concatenation of the 13 protein coding genes demonstrated that An. marshallii was the closest relative based on existing sequence data. This study demonstrates that the skimming approach is an inexpensive and efficient approach for mosquito species identification and concurrent taxonomic rectification, which may be a useful alternative for generating reference sequence data for evolutionary studies among the Culicidae.

     alt="Thalamic activity-dependent specification of sensory input neurons in the developing chick entopallium"/>
<p>In the developing chick pallium, input neurons located in the entopallium (top, green region) are born from lateral and ventral pallial (LP and VP) precursors (bottom left, blue). LP- and VP-derived neurons then receive thalamic axons around E10 and are specified into input neurons by receiving neuronal activity from thalamic axon within the entopallium E11 onward (bottom right, green cells)

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During development, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors play important roles in neuronal differentiation; however, the underlying mechanisms in nonmammalian species remain largely unknown. We here investigated the mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of sensory input neurons in the chick entopallium, which receives its primary visual input via the tectofugal pathway from the nucleus rotundus. The results obtained revealed that input neurons in the entopallium expressed Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 5 (KCNH5/EAG2) mRNA from embryonic day (E) 11. On the other hand, the onset of protein expression was E20, which was 1 day before hatching. We confirm that entopallium input neurons in chicks were generated during early neurogenesis in the lateral and ventral ventricular zones. Notably, neurons derived from the lateral (LP) and ventral pallium (VP) exhibited a spatially distinct distribution along the rostro–caudal axis. We further demonstrated that the expression of EAG2 was directly regulated by input activity from thalamic axons. Collectively, the present results reveal that thalamic input activity is essential for specifying input neurons among LP- and VP-derived early-generated neurons in the developing chick entopallium.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Pioneering investigations in the mid-19th century revealed that the perception of tactile cues presented to the surface of the skin improves with training, which is referred to as tactile learning. Surprisingly, tactile learning also occurs for body parts and skin locations that are not physically involved in the training. For example, after training of a finger, tactile learning transfers to adjacent untrained fingers. This suggests that the transfer of tactile learning follows a somatotopic pattern and involves brain regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), in which the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations are represented close to each other. However, other results showed that transfer occurs between body parts that are not represented close to each other in S1—for example, between the hand and the foot. These and similar findings have led to the suggestion of additional cortical mechanisms to explain the transfer of tactile learning. Here, different mechanisms are reviewed, and the extent to which they can explain the transfer of tactile learning is discussed. What all of these mechanisms have in common is that they assume a representational or functional relationship between the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations. However, none of these mechanisms alone can explain the complex pattern of transfer results, and it is likely that different mechanisms interact to enable transfer, perhaps in concert with higher somatosensory and decision-making areas.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 6; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Background Surgical site infection (SSI), albeit infrequent, drastically impacts the quality of care. This article endeavors to investigate the predictive factors of SSIs following surgical interventions that involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within a single institution in a resource-limited setting. Methods Over seven years from June 2015 to June 2022, patients who underwent GI surgery and developed SSI were retrospectively matched with an unaffected case-control cohort of patients. Standardized techniques for wound culture, laboratory evaluation of bacterial isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were employed. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the predictive factors associated with 30-day postoperative SSI occurrence. Results A total of 525 patients who underwent GI surgical procedures were included, among whom, 86 (16.4%) developed SSI and the majority of SSIs were superficial (74.4%). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacterium (54.4%), and a high percentage of multidrug-resistant organisms were observed (63.8%). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, illiteracy (Odds ratio [OR]:40.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.54-170.26), smoking (OR: 21.15; 95% CI: 4.63-96.67), diabetes (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: 2.27-11.35), leukocytosis (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24-5.53), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.35-10.16), contaminated and dirty wounds (OR: 6.51; 95% CI:1.62-26.09), longer operation duration (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), emergency operations (OR: 12.58; 95% CI: 2.91-54.30), and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.28-7.10) were the independent risk factors for SSI (all p < 0.05). Conclusions This study highlights significant predictors of SSI, including illiteracy, smoking, diabetes, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, contaminated and dirty wounds, longer operative time, emergency operations, and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Identifying these risk factors can help surgeons adopt appropriate measures to reduce postoperative SSI and improve the quality of surgical care, especially in a resource-limited setting with no obvious and strict policy for reducing SSI.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The plains vizcacha, <i>Lagostomus maximus</i>, is a precocial hystricomorph rodent with a gyrencephalic brain. This work aimed to perform a time-lapse analysis of the embryonic brain cortical development in the plains vizcacha to establish a species-specific temporal window for corticogenesis and the gyrencephaly onset. Additionally, a comparative examination with evolutionarily related rodents was conducted. Embryos from 40 embryonic days (ED) until the end of pregnancy (∼$\sim $154 ED) were evaluated. The neuroanatomical examination determined transverse sulci at 80 ED and rostral lateral and caudal intraparietal sulci around 95 ED. Histological examination of corticogenesis showed emergence of the subplate at 43 ED and expansion of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and its division into inner and outer SVZs around 54 ED. The neocortical layers formation followed an inside-to-outside spatiotemporal gradient beginning with the emergence of layers VI and V at 68 ED and establishing the final six neocortical layers around 100 ED. A progressive increment of gyrencephalization index (GI) from 1.005 ± 0.003 around 70 ED, which reflects a smooth cortex, up to 1.07 ± 0.009 at the end of gestation, reflecting a gyrencephalic neuroanatomy, was determined. Contrarily, the minimum cortical thickness (MCT) progressively decreased from 61 ED up to the end of gestation. These results show that the decrease in the cortical thickness, which enables the onset of neocortical invaginations, occurs together with the expansion and subdivision of the SVZ. The temporal comparison of corticogenesis in plains vizcacha with that in relative species reflects a prenatal long process compared with other rodents that may give an evolutionary advantage to <i>L. maximus</i> as a precocial species.</p>

                Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) controls cholesterol homeostasis. To assess the feasibility of a PCSK9-based heart attack vaccine, Zhang et al. create a PCSK9 mimic and demonstrate in mice and NHPs its ability to significantly reduce cholesterol. Unexpectedly, the vaccine-induced antibodies also altered the PCSK9 half-life, blunting vaccine impact.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94315">Neurexins control the strength and precise timing of glycinergic inhibition in the auditory brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Neurexins play diverse functions as presynaptic organizers in various glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. However, it remains unknown whether and how neurexins are involved in shaping functional properties of the glycinergic synapses, which mediate prominent inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord. To address these issues, we examined the role of neurexins in a model glycinergic synapse between the principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the principal neuron in the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem. Combining RNAscope with stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in the MNTB of neurexin1/2/3 conditional triple knockout mice, we showed that MNTB neurons highly express all isoforms of neurexins although their expression levels vary remarkably. Selective ablation of all neurexins in MNTB neurons not only reduced the amplitude but also altered the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission at LSO neurons. The synaptic dysfunctions primarily resulted from an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of release and a loosened coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles. Together, our current findings demonstrate that neurexins are essential in controlling the strength and temporal precision of the glycinergic synapse, which therefore corroborates the role of neurexins as key presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91711">The larva and adult of Helicoverpa armigera use differential gustatory receptors to sense sucrose</a></h4>

              
                Almost all herbivorous insects feed on plants and use sucrose as a feeding stimulant, but the molecular basis of their sucrose reception remains unclear. <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. In this study, we determined that the sucrose sensory neurons located in the contact chemosensilla on larval maxillary galea were 100–1000 times more sensitive to sucrose than those on adult antennae, tarsi, and proboscis. Using the <i>Xenopus</i> expression system, we discovered that Gr10 highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while Gr6 highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas9, we revealed that Gr10 was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while Gr6 was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt toward the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90316">Proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of the TRMT1 tRNA modification enzyme by SARS-CoV-2 main protease</a></h4>

              
                Nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81875">Fetal growth delay caused by loss of non-canonical imprinting is resolved late in pregnancy and culminates in offspring overgrowth</a></h4>

              
                Germline epigenetic programming, including genomic imprinting, substantially influences offspring development. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to growth and developmental changes in mouse offspring. In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the PRC2 protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially developmentally delayed, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial growth delay in mid-gestation embryos. This initial developmental delay was resolved as offspring underwent accelerated fetal development and growth in late gestation resulting in offspring that were similar stage and weight to controls at birth. The accelerated development and growth in offspring from <i>Eed</i>-null oocytes was associated with remodelling of the placenta, which involved an increase in fetal and maternal tissue size, conspicuous expansion of the glycogen-enriched cell population, and delayed parturition. Despite placental remodelling and accelerated offspring fetal growth and development, placental efficiency, and fetal blood glucose levels were low, and the fetal blood metabolome was unchanged. Moreover, while expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene and amino acid transporter <i>Slc38a4</i> was increased, fetal blood levels of individual amino acids were similar to controls, indicating that placental amino acid transport was not enhanced. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation and DNA methylation changes in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Together, while deletion of <i>Eed</i> in growing oocytes resulted in fetal growth and developmental delay and placental hyperplasia, our data indicate a remarkable capacity for offspring fetal growth to be normalised despite inefficient placental function and the loss of H3K27me3-dependent genomic imprinting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89353">H1 restricts euchromatin-associated methylation pathways from heterochromatic encroachment</a></h4>

              
                Silencing pathways prevent transposable element (TE) proliferation and help to maintain genome integrity through cell division. Silenced genomic regions can be classified as either euchromatic or heterochromatic, and are targeted by genetically separable epigenetic pathways. In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targets mostly euchromatic regions, while CMT DNA methyltransferases are mainly associated with heterochromatin. However, many epigenetic features - including DNA methylation patterning - are largely indistinguishable between these regions, so how the functional separation is maintained is unclear. The linker histone H1 is preferentially localized to heterochromatin and has been proposed to restrict RdDM from encroachment. To test this hypothesis, we followed RdDM genomic localization in an <i>h1</i> mutant by performing ChIP-seq on the largest subunit, NRPE1, of the central RdDM polymerase, Pol V. Loss of H1 resulted in NRPE1 enrichment predominantly in heterochromatic TEs. Increased NRPE1 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in <i>h1</i>, suggesting that H1 restricts NRPE1 occupancy by compacting chromatin. However, RdDM occupancy did not impact H1 localization, demonstrating that H1 hierarchically restricts RdDM positioning. H1 mutants experience major symmetric (CG and CHG) DNA methylation gains, and by generating an <i>h1/nrpe1</i> double mutant, we demonstrate these gains are largely independent of RdDM. However, loss of NRPE1 occupancy from a subset of euchromatic regions in <i>h1</i> corresponded to the loss of methylation in all sequence contexts, while at ectopically bound heterochromatic loci, NRPE1 deposition correlated with increased methylation specifically in the CHH context. Additionally, we found that H1 similarly restricts the occupancy of the methylation reader, SUVH1, and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3. Together, the results support a model whereby H1 helps maintain the exclusivity of heterochromatin by preventing encroachment from other competing pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91533">Theoretical principles explain the structure of the insect head direction circuit</a></h4>

              
                To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.

">Amygdala engages non-emotional multi-item working memory maintenance through amygdala-hippocampus interaction</a></h4>

              
                The process of holding information in working memory (WM) is an active one that requires neural activity within and between regions. The human amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HPC) are known to play crucial roles in emotional WM processing. Although human electrophysiological studies have made remarkable progress in revealing that HPC supports multi-item maintenance in a load-dependent manner, the characteristics of AMY and the circuit-level mechanisms underpinning AMY-HPC interactions remain largely unexplored. To address this gap in our knowledge, this study employed intracranial EEG recordings from AMY and HPC in nine epileptic patients to evaluate intra-regional neural representations and inter-regional communications during maintenance under different non-emotional WM loads. The results showed that high load enhances low-frequency power and intra-regional theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in AMY and HPC. On the network level, high load elicits an increase in the strength of the modulation of HPC theta phase entraining AMY gamma amplitude. Furthermore, high load elevates AMY-aHPC theta phase synchrony and directional connectivity strength, with the direction being from anterior HPC (aHPC) to AMY. Conversely, posterior HPC (pHPC)-AMY synchrony is not affected by load variations. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of AMY in non-emotional WM tasks and shed new light on the neurophysiological basis of AMY-HPC interactions during WM maintenance.

">Dopamine mediated plasticity preserves excitatory connections to direct pathway striatal projection neurons and motor function in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as bradykinesia and akinesia are debilitating, and treatment options remain inadequate. The loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in PD produces motor symptoms by shifting the balance of striatal output from the direct (go) to indirect (no-go) pathway in large part through changes in the excitatory connections and intrinsic excitabilities of the striatal projection neurons (SPNs). Here, we report using two different experimental models that a transient increase in striatal dopamine and enhanced D1 receptor activation, during 6-OHDA dopamine depletion, prevent the loss of mature spines and dendritic arbors on direct pathway projection neurons (dSPNs) and normal motor behavior for up to 5 months. The primary motor cortex and midline thalamic nuclei provide the major excitatory connections to SPNs. Using ChR2-assisted circuit mapping to measure inputs from motor cortex M1 to dorsolateral dSPNs, we observed a dramatic reduction in both experimental model mice and controls following dopamine depletion. Changes in the intrinsic excitabilities of SPNs were also similar to controls following dopamine depletion. Future work will examine thalamic connections to dSPNs. The findings reported here reveal previously unappreciated plasticity mechanisms within the basal ganglia that can be leveraged to treat the motor symptoms of PD

                Perceptual biases offer a glimpse into how the brain processes sensory stimuli. While psychophysics has uncovered systematic biases such as contraction and repulsion, a unifying neural network model for how such seemingly distinct biases emerge from learning is lacking. Here, we show that both contractive and repulsive biases emerge from continuous Hebbian plasticity in a single recurrent neural network. We test our model in three experimental paradigms: a working memory task, a reference memory task, and a novel "one-back task" that we design to test the robustness of the model. We find excellent agreement between model predictions and experimental data without fine-tuning the model to any particular paradigm. These results show that apparently contradictory perceptual biases can in fact emerge from a simple local learning rule in a single recurrent region of the brain.

                Assigning valence to stimuli for adaptive behavior is an essential function, involving the ventral tegmental area (VTA). VTA cell types are often defined through neurotransmitters (NT). However, valence function in VTA does not parse along NT-boundaries as, within each NT-class, certain neurons are excited by reward and others by stressors. Here we identify the co-activated mouse VTA neuronal ensembles for reward and stress, and determine their role in adaptive behaviors. We show that stimuli of opposite valence (opioid vs acute social stress) recruit two segregated intermingled small VTA neuronal ensembles. These two ensembles continue to be preferentially engaged by congruent valence stimuli. Stimulation of VTA stress- or reward ensembles is aversive/reinforcing, respectively. Strikingly, external valence stimuli fully require activity of these small discrete VTA ensembles for conferring approach/avoidance outcomes. Overall, our study identifies distinct small VTA ensembles for positive and negative valence coding and shows their indispensability for adaptive behavior.

">Comparing Methods for Deriving the Auditory Brainstem Response to Continuous Speech in Human Listeners</a></h4>

              
                Several tools have recently been developed to derive the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) from continuous natural speech, facilitating investigation into subcortical encoding of speech. These tools rely on deconvolution, which models the subcortical auditory pathway as a linear system, where a nonlinearly processed stimulus is taken as the input (i.e., regressor), the electroencephalogram (EEG) data as the output, and the ABR as the impulse response deconvolved from the recorded EEG and the regressor. In this study, we analyzed EEG recordings from subjects listening to both unaltered natural speech and synthesized "peaky speech." We compared the derived ABRs using three regressors: the half-wave rectified stimulus (HWR) from Maddox and Lee (2018), the glottal pulse train (GP) from Polonenko and Maddox (2021), and the auditory nerve modeled response (ANM) from Shan et al. (2024). Our evaluation focused on the fidelity, efficiency, and practicality of each method in different scenarios. The results indicate that the ANM regressor for both peaky and unaltered speech and the GP regressor for peaky speech provided the best performance, whereas the HWR regressor demonstrated relatively poorer performance. The findings in this study will guide future research in selecting the most appropriate paradigm for ABR derivation from continuous, naturalistic speech.

">Cortical determinants of loudness perception and auditory hypersensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (PVNs) stabilize cortical network activity, generate gamma rhythms, and regulate experience-dependent plasticity. Here, we observed that activation or inactivation of PVNs functioned like a volume knob in the mouse auditory cortex (ACtx), turning neural and behavioral classification of sound level up or down over a 20dB range. PVN loudness adjustments were ''sticky'', such that a single bout of 40Hz PVN stimulation sustainably suppressed ACtx sound responsiveness, potentiated feedforward inhibition, and behaviorally desensitized mice to loudness. Sensory sensitivity is a cardinal feature of autism, aging, and peripheral neuropathy, prompting us to ask whether PVN stimulation can persistently desensitize mice with ACtx hyperactivity, PVN hypofunction, and loudness hypersensitivity triggered by cochlear sensorineural damage. We found that a single 16-minute bout of 40Hz PVN stimulation session restored normal loudness perception for one week, showing that perceptual deficits triggered by irreversible peripheral injuries can be reversed through targeted cortical circuit interventions.

">Disrupted Hippocampal Theta-Gamma Coupling and Spike-Field Coherence Following Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often results in persistent learning and memory deficits, likely due to disrupted hippocampal circuitry underlying these processes. Precise temporal control of hippocampal neuronal activity is important for memory encoding and retrieval and is supported by oscillations that dynamically organize single unit firing. Using high-density laminar electrophysiology, we discovered a loss of oscillatory power across CA1 lamina, with a profound, layer-specific reduction in theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in injured rats. Interneurons from injured animals were less strongly entrained to theta and gamma oscillations, suggesting a mechanism for the loss of coupling, while pyramidal cells were entrained to a later phase of theta. During quiet immobility, we report decreased ripple amplitudes from injured animals during sharp-wave ripple events. These results reveal deficits in information encoding and retrieval schemes essential to cognition that likely underlie TBI-associated learning and memory impairments, and elucidate potential targets for future neuromodulation therapies.

">Loss of the MeCP2 gene in parvalbumin interneurons leads to an inhibitory deficit in the amygdala and affects its functional connectivity.</a></h4>

              
                Background: MECP2 gene is located in the X-chromosome and encodes a methyl-CpG-binding protein involved in transcription regulation. The loss-of-function mutation and the duplication of the MECP2 gene, causing the gain-of-function, lead to severe neurodevelopmental syndromes: Rett syndrome and MECP2 gene duplication syndrome. Clinical picture of both syndromes includes, among other symptoms, social deficits and heightened anxiety. The amygdala is involved in the regulation of social behavior as well as fear and anxiety. Here, we investigated the effect of the MeCP2 gene ablation in the parvalbumin interneurons on the microcircuit and functional connectivity of the amygdala in a genetic mouse model of Rett syndrome. Methods: Males with conditional knock-out of the MeCP2 gene in the parvalbumin interneurons were used as a genetic mouse model of Rett syndrome. Littermates with the intact gene were used as controls. Ex-vivo brain slice electrophysiology, combined with pharmacology and optogenetics, was used to characterize microcircuits within the lateral amygdala of a genetic mouse model. Synaptic currents and excitability of parvalbumin interneurons and principal neurons were analyzed by a whole-cell patch clamp. In-vivo functional ultrasound was used to visualize the connectivity within the amygdala-ventral hippocampus-prefrontal cortex triad. Results: Loss of MeCP2 in parvalbumin interneurons caused a significant reduction of the inhibitory drive to the principal neurons within the lateral amygdala microcircuitry. Decreased inhibitory synaptic connectivity was accompanied by an increase in the excitability of principal neurons in the lateral amygdala, which was associated with the deficit in the GABA drive and reduced potassium currents. The in vivo functional connectivity of the amygdala-ventral hippocampus and amygdala-prefrontal cortex was significantly reduced in conditional knock-outs compared to their littermates with the intact gene in the X chromosome. Conclusions: Our study characterized the consequences of the MeCP2 gene loss in the parvalbumin interneurons on the amygdala connectivity and microcircuit and provided evidence supporting the previous findings on the role of interneurons in the functional deficit observed in animal models with MeCP2 loss.

">Individual differences in the expression and control of anger are encoded in the same fronto-temporal GM-WM network</a></h4>

              
                Anger can be deconstructed into distinct components: a temporary emotional state (state anger), a stable personality trait (trait anger), a tendency to outwardly express it (anger-out), or to internally suppress it (anger-in), and the capability to manage it (anger control). These aspects exhibit individual differences that vary across a continuum. Notably, the capacity to express and control anger are of great importance to modulate our reactions in interpersonal situations. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that anger expression and control are negatively correlated and that both can be decoded by the same patterns of grey and white matter features of a fronto-temporal brain network. To this aim, a data fusion unsupervised machine learning technique, known as transposed Independent Vector Analysis (tIVA), was used to decompose the brain into covarying GM-WM networks and then backward regression was used to predict both anger expression and control from a sample of 212 healthy subjects. Confirming our hypothesis, results showed that anger control and anger expression are negatively correlated, the more individuals control anger, the less they externalize it. At the neural level, individual differences in anger expression and control can be predicted by the same GM-WM network. As expected, this network included fronto-temporal regions as well as the cingulate, the insula and the precuneus. The higher the concentration of GM-WM in this brain network, the higher level of externalization of anger, and the lower the anger control. These results expand previous findings regarding the neural bases of anger by showing that individual differences in anger control and expression can be predicted by morphometric features.

">Balanced bidirectional optogenetics reveals the causal impact of cortical temporal dynamics in sensory perception</a></h4>

              
                Whether the fast temporal dynamics of neural activity in brain circuits causally drive perception and cognition remains one of most longstanding unresolved questions in neuroscience1-6. While some theories posit a "timing code" in which dynamics on the millisecond timescale is central to brain function, others instead argue that mean firing rates over more extended periods (a "rate code") carry most of the relevant information. Existing tools, such as optogenetics, can be used to alter temporal structure of neural dynamics7, but they invariably change mean firing rates, leaving the interpretation of such experiments ambiguous. Here we developed and validated a new approach based on balanced, bidirectional optogenetics that can alter temporal structure of neural dynamics while mitigating effects on mean activity. Using this new approach, we found that selectively altering cortical temporal dynamics substantially reduced performance in a sensory perceptual task. These results demonstrate that endogenous temporal dynamics in the cortex are causally required for perception and behavior. More generally, this new bidirectional optogenetic approach should be broadly useful for disentangling the causal impact of different timescales of neural dynamics on behavior.

">Normative evidence weighting and accumulation in correlated environments</a></h4>

              
                The brain forms certain deliberative decisions following normative principles related to how sensory observations are weighed and accumulated over time. Previously we showed that these principles can account for how people adapt their decisions to the temporal dynamics of the observations (Glaze et al., 2015). Here we show that this adaptability extends to accounting for correlations in the observations, which can have a dramatic impact on the weight of evidence provided by those observations. We tested online human participants on a novel visual-discrimination task with pairwise-correlated observations. With minimal training, the participants adapted to uncued, trial-by-trial changes in the correlations and produced decisions based on an approximately normative weighting and accumulation of evidence. The results highlight the robustness of our brain's ability to process sensory observations with respect to not just their physical features but also the weight of evidence they provide for a given decision.

">Unveiling Stimulus Transduction Artifacts in Auditory Steady-State Response Experiments: Characterization, Risks, and Mitigation Strategies</a></h4>

              
                This scientific paper addresses the potential risk of spurious responses in neuroscientific auditory steady-state response (ASSR) experiments attributed to transduction artifacts. The focus is particularly on click train stimuli, given their spectral content in the frequency range of interest (e.g., 40 Hz). Building upon a pilot experiment demonstrating the existence of the artifact in a phantom head, this study focuses on the characterization of stimulus artifacts in extended measurements with phantoms and the evaluation of associated risks in experiments involving human subjects. The investigation is divided into two parts: the first part scrutinizes stimulus artifact properties crucial for mitigation, while the second part assesses risks in ASSR experiments with human subjects based on the characterized artifact. The discussion covers stimulus characterization, experimental setups with phantoms, and experiments with human subjects, exploring potential sources of the artifact, its spatial properties, and the influence of re-referencing. The results reveal the role of headphone cables as a source of stimulus artifacts, along with the surprising impact of headphone transducers. The study emphasizes the need for careful experimental design and data analysis to avoid misinterpretations of stimulus artifacts as genuine brain responses in ASSR experiments.

">Predicting task-related brain activity from resting-state brain dynamics with fMRI Transformer</a></h4>

              
                Accurate prediction of the brain's task reactivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a significant challenge in neuroscience. Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns of brain function. This study introduces SwiFUN (Swin fMRI UNet Transformer), a novel deep-learning framework designed to predict 3D task activation maps directly from resting-state fMRI scans. SwiFUN leverages advanced techniques such as shifted window-based self-attention, which helps to understand complex patterns by focusing on varying parts of the data sequentially, and a contrastive learning strategy to better capture individual differences among subjects. When applied to predicting emotion-related task activation in adults (UK Biobank, n=7,038) and children (ABCD, n=4,944), SwiFUN consistently achieved higher overall prediction accuracy than existing methods across all contrasts; it demonstrated an improvement of up to 27% for the FACES-PLACES contrast in ABCD data. The resulting task activation maps revealed individual differences across cortical and subcortical regions associated with sex, age, and depressive symptoms. This scalable, transformer-based approach potentially reduces the need for task-based fMRI in clinical settings, marking a promising direction for future neuroscience and clinical research that enhances our ability to understand and predict brain function.

	<p>Researchers have long recognized that friends tend to exhibit behaviors that are more similar to each other than to those of non-friends. In recent years, the concept of neural similarity or neural synchrony among friends has garnered significant attention. This body of research bifurcates into two primary areas of focus: the specificity of neural similarity among friends (vs. non-friends) and the situational factors that influence neural synchrony among friends. This review synthesizes the complex findings to date, highlighting consistencies and identifying gaps in the current understanding. It aims to provide a coherent overview of the nuanced interplay between social relationships and neural processes, offering valuable insights for future investigations in this field.</p>

	<p>Disease prediction is greatly challenged by the scarcity of datasets and privacy concerns associated with real medical data. An approach that stands out to circumvent this hurdle is the use of synthetic data generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs can increase data volume while generating synthetic datasets that have no direct link to personal information. This study pioneers the use of GANs to create synthetic datasets and datasets augmented using traditional augmentation techniques for our binary classification task. The primary aim of this research was to evaluate the performance of our novel Conditional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (C-DCNN) model in classifying brain tumors by leveraging these augmented and synthetic datasets. We utilized advanced GAN models, including Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), to produce synthetic data that retained essential characteristics of the original datasets while ensuring privacy protection. Our C-DCNN model was trained on both augmented and synthetic datasets, and its performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3. The evaluation metrics demonstrated that our C-DCNN model achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 99% on both synthetic and augmented images, outperforming the comparative models. The findings of this study highlight the potential of using GAN-generated synthetic data in enhancing the training of machine learning models for medical image classification, particularly in scenarios with limited data available. This approach not only improves model accuracy but also addresses privacy concerns, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical applications in disease prediction and diagnosis.</p>

	<p>In non-clinical populations, facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) may vary in their contribution to face identity perception. Changes to whole faces are easier to detect than changes to individual features, and eye changes are typically easier to detect than mouth changes, which in turn are easier to detect than nose changes. However, how this differs for people with face recognition difficulties (developmental prosopagnosia; DP) and for individuals with superior face recognition abilities (super-recognisers; SR) is not clear; although findings from previous studies have suggested differences, the nature of this difference is not understood. The aim of this study was to examine whether differences in the ability to detect feature changes in DPs and SRs were (a) quantitative, meaning that the pattern across feature changes remained the same but there was an overall upwards or downwards shift in performance, or (b) qualitative, meaning that the pattern across feature changes was different. Using a change detection task in which individual face features (eyes, nose, mouth) changed between sequentially presented faces, we found that while prosopagnosics showed a quantitative difference in performance with a downwards shift across all conditions, super-recognisers only showed qualitative differences: they were better able to detect when the face was the same and were marginally (but not non-significantly) worse at detecting when the eyes changed. Further, the only condition which distinguished between the three groups was the ability to identify when the same face was presented, with SRs being better than controls, and controls being better than DPs. Our findings suggest that, in feature-matching tasks, differences for DPs are due to them being overall worse at the task, while SRs use a qualitatively different strategy.</p>

	<p>Research supports the efficacy of therapeutic hypnosis for reducing acute and chronic pain. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. This paper provides a review of the evidence regarding the role that electroencephalogram-assessed bandwidth power has in identifying who might benefit the most from hypnotic analgesia and how these effects occur. Findings are discussed in terms of the slow wave hypothesis, which posits that brain activity in slower bandwidths (e.g., theta and alpha) can facilitate hypnosis responsivity. Although the extant research is limited by small sample sizes, the findings from this research are generally consistent with the slow wave hypothesis. More research, including and especially studies with larger sample sizes, is needed to confirm these preliminary positive findings.</p>

	<p>Developmental changes in functional neural networks are sensitive to environmental influences. This EEG study investigated how infant brain responses relate to the social context that their families live in. Event-related potentials of 255 healthy, awake infants between six and fourteen months were measured during a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Infants were presented with 200 standard tones and 48 randomly distributed deviants. All infants are part of a longitudinal study focusing on families with socioeconomic and/or cultural challenges (Bremen Initiative to Foster Early Childhood Development; BRISE; Germany). As part of their familial socioeconomic status (SES), parental level of education and infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s migration background were assessed with questionnaires. For 30.6% of the infants both parents had a low level of education (&amp;amp;le;10 years of schooling) and for 43.1% of the infants at least one parent was born abroad. The N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex is associated with unintentional directing of attention to deviant stimuli and was analysed in frontocentral brain regions. Age was utilised as a control variable. Our results show that tone deviations in infants trigger an immature N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex. Contrary to studies with older children or adults, the N2 amplitude was more positive for deviants than for standards. This may be related to an immature superposition of the N2 with the P3a. For infants whose parents had no high-school degree and were born abroad, this tendency was increased, indicating that facing multiple challenges as a young family impacts on the infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s early neural development. As such, attending to unexpected stimulus changes may be important for early learning processes. Variations of the infant N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex may, thus, relate to early changes in attentional capacity and learning experiences due to familial challenges. This points towards the importance of early prevention programs.</p>

	<p>Mood disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) are of immense medical and social concern. Although significant progress on neuronal involvement in mood and reward circuitries has been achieved, it is only relatively recently that the role of glia in these disorders has attracted attention. Detailed understanding of the glial functions in these devastating diseases could offer novel interventions. Here, following a brief review of circuitries involved in mood regulation and reward perception, the specific contributions of neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota to these diseases are highlighted. In this context, the role of specific glial cells (e.g., microglia, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and synantocytes) on phenotypic manifestation of mood disorders or SUD are emphasized. In addition, use of this knowledge in the potential development of novel therapeutics is touched upon.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in treating sleep disorders in PD. It included 24 patients with PD who had sleep disorders. Group allocations (active or sham with a ratio of 2:1) were placed in serially numbered closed envelopes. Each patient was evaluated with the following: MDS-UPDRS, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and polysomnography (PSG) before and 10 days after the treatment sessions. Each session consisted of 10 trains, 20 Hz, 10 sec for each, over the parietal cortex (bilaterally). Scores of UPDRS, BDI, and PDSS improved significantly in the active group but not in the sham group. The PSG data showed that sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latencies (min), REM duration, and time spent awake (both as %TST) were improved after rTMS in the active group compared with the sham group. The number of awakenings, the wake-after-sleep onset index, the arousal index, and periodic leg movements (PLMs) were all significantly reduced in the active group but not in the sham group. Ten sessions of 20 Hz rTMS over parietal cortexes improved sleep quality and PLMs in patients with PD. The improvement in PSG and PDSS were correlated with improvements in UPDRS and BDI scores.</p>

	<p>To date, most studies examined the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) on neuromuscular control following exercise solely on measuring proprioception, no study explores changes in the brain and muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI following exercise on knee neuromuscular control capacity, and physiological and perceptual responses. In a crossover control design, fifteen participants performed an exhaustion exercise. Subsequently, they underwent a 10 min recovery intervention, either in the form of passively seated rest (CON) or CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C. The knee proprioception, oxygenated cerebral hemoglobin concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;[HbO]), and muscle activation during the proprioception test, physiological and perceptual responses were measured. CWI did not have a significant effect on proprioception at the post-intervention but attenuated the reductions in &amp;amp;Delta;[HbO] in the primary sensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The root mean square of vastus medialis was higher in the CWI compared to the CON. CWI effectively reduced core temperature and mean skin temperature and improved the rating of perceived exertion and thermal sensation. These results indicated that 10 min of CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C post-exercise had no negative effect on the neuromuscular control of the knee joint but could improve subjective perception and decrease body temperature.</p>

                <p>The ability to remember changes in the surroundings is fundamental for daily life. It has been proposed that novel events producing dopamine release in the hippocampal CA1 region could modulate spatial memory formation. However, the role of hippocampal dopamine increase on weak or strong spatial memories remains unclear. We show that male mice exploring two objects located in a familiar environment for 5&nbsp;min created a short-term memory (weak) that cannot be retrieved 1&nbsp;d later, whereas 10&nbsp;min exploration created a long-term memory (strong) that can be retrieved 1&nbsp;d later. Remarkably, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the encoding of weak object location memories (OLMs) allowed their retrieval 1&nbsp;d later but dopamine elevation during the encoding of strong OLMs promoted the preference for a familiar object location over a novel object location after 24&nbsp;h. Moreover, dopamine uncaging after the encoding of OLMs did not have effect on weak memories whereas on strong memories diminished the exploration of the novel object location. Additionally, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the retrieval of OLMs did not allow the recovery of weak memories and did not affect the retrieval of strong memory traces. Finally, dopamine elevation increased hippocampal theta oscillations, indicating that dopamine promotes the recurrent activation of specific groups of neurons. Our experiments demonstrate that hippocampal dopaminergic modulation during the encoding of OLMs depends on memory strength indicating that hyperdopaminergic levels that enhance weak experiences could compromise the normal storage of strong memories.</p>

                <p>This study compared the impact of spectral and temporal degradation on vocoded speech recognition between early-blind and sighted subjects. The participants included 25 early-blind subjects (30.32 &plusmn; 4.88&nbsp;years; male:female, 14:11) and 25 age- and sex-matched sighted subjects. Tests included monosyllable recognition in noise at various signal-to-noise ratios (&ndash;18 to &ndash;4&nbsp;dB), matrix sentence-in-noise recognition, and vocoded speech recognition with different numbers of channels (4, 8, 16, and 32) and temporal envelope cutoff frequencies (50 vs 500&nbsp;Hz). Cortical-evoked potentials (N2 and P3b) were measured in response to spectrally and temporally degraded stimuli. The early-blind subjects displayed superior monosyllable and sentence recognition than sighted subjects (all <I>p</I> &lt; 0.01). In the vocoded speech recognition test, a three-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (two groups <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> four channels <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> two cutoff frequencies) revealed significant main effects of group, channel, and cutoff frequency (all <I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). Early-blind subjects showed increased sensitivity to spectral degradation for speech recognition, evident in the significant interaction between group and channel (<I>p</I> = 0.007). N2 responses in early-blind subjects exhibited shorter latency and greater amplitude in the 8-channel (<I>p</I> = 0.022 and 0.034, respectively) and shorter latency in the 16-channel (<I>p</I> = 0.049) compared with sighted subjects. In conclusion, early-blind subjects demonstrated speech recognition advantages over sighted subjects, even in the presence of spectral and temporal degradation. Spectral degradation had a greater impact on speech recognition in early-blind subjects, while the effect of temporal degradation was similar in both groups.</p>

                <p>Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain represent the main source of cholinergic innervation of large parts of the neocortex and are involved in adults in the modulation of attention, memory, and arousal. During the first postnatal days, they play a crucial role in the development of cortical neurons and cortical cytoarchitecture. However, their characteristics, during this period have not been studied. To understand how they can fulfill this role, we investigated the morphological and electrophysiological maturation of cholinergic neurons of the substantia innominata&ndash;nucleus basalis of Meynert (SI/NBM) complex in the perinatal period in mice. We show that cholinergic neurons, whether or not they express gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a cotransmitter, are already functional at Embryonic Day 18. Until the end of the first postnatal week, they constitute a single population of neurons with a well developed dendritic tree, a spontaneous activity including bursting periods, and a short-latency response to depolarizations (early-firing). They are excited by both their GABAergic and glutamatergic afferents. During the second postnatal week, a second, less excitable, neuronal population emerges, with a longer delay response to depolarizations (late-firing), together with the hyperpolarizing action of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated currents. This classification into early-firing (40%) and late-firing (60%) neurons is again independent of the coexpression of GABAergic markers. These results strongly suggest that during the first postnatal week, the specific properties of developing SI/NBM cholinergic neurons allow them to spontaneously release acetylcholine (ACh), or ACh and GABA, into the developing cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/22/e0078242024?rss=1">Adaptive Responding to Stimulus-Outcome Associations Requires Noradrenergic Transmission in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dynamic environment, such as the one we inhabit, requires organisms to continuously update their knowledge of the setting. While the prefrontal cortex is recognized for its pivotal role in regulating such adaptive behavior, the specific contribution of each prefrontal area remains elusive. In the current work, we investigated the direct involvement of two major prefrontal subregions, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, A32D + A32V) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, VO + LO), in updating pavlovian stimulus&ndash;outcome (S&ndash;O) associations following contingency degradation in male rats. Specifically, animals had to learn that a particular cue, previously fully predicting the delivery of a specific reward, was no longer a reliable predictor. First, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC, but not of OFC, neurons altered the rats&rsquo; ability to adaptively respond to degraded and non-degraded cues. Next, given the growing evidence pointing at noradrenaline (NA) as a main neuromodulator of adaptive behavior, we decided to investigate the possible involvement of NA projections to the two subregions in this higher-order cognitive process. Employing a pair of novel retrograde vectors, we traced NA projections from the locus ceruleus (LC) to both structures and observed an equivalent yet relatively segregated amount of inputs. Then, we showed that chemogenetic inhibition of NA projections to the mPFC, but not to the OFC, also impaired the rats&rsquo; ability to adaptively respond to the degradation procedure. Altogether, our findings provide important evidence of functional parcellation within the prefrontal cortex and point at mPFC NA as key for updating pavlovian S&ndash;O associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/22/e1093222024?rss=1">Differential Vulnerability and Response to Injury among Brain Cell Types Comprising the Neurovascular Unit</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neurovascular unit (NVU) includes multiple different cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and pericytes, which respond to insults on very different time or dose scales. We defined differential vulnerability among these cell types, using response to two different insults: oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) and thrombin-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that neurons are most vulnerable, followed by endothelial cells and astrocytes. After temporary focal cerebral ischemia in male rats, we found significantly more injured neurons, compared with astrocytes in the ischemic area, consistent with differential vulnerability in vivo. We sought to illustrate different and shared mechanisms across all cell types during response to insult. We found that gene expression profiles in response to OGD differed among the cell types, with a paucity of gene responses shared by all types. All cell types activated genes relating to autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but the specific genes differed. Astrocytes and endothelial cells also activated pathways connected to DNA repair and antiapoptosis. Taken together, the data support the concept of differential vulnerability in the NVU and suggest that different elements of the unit will evolve from salvageable to irretrievable on different time scales while residing in the same brain region and receiving the same (ischemic) blood flow. Future work will focus on the mechanisms of these differences. These data suggest future stroke therapy development should target different elements of the NVU differently.</p>

                <p>Creating and evaluating predictions are considered important features in sensory perception. Little is known about processing differences between the senses and their cortical substrates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that olfaction, the sense of smell, would be highly dependent on (nonolfactory) object-predictive cues and involve distinct cortical processing features. We developed a novel paradigm to compare prediction error processing across senses. Participants listened to spoken word cues (e.g., "lilac") and determined whether target stimuli (odors or pictures) matched the word cue or not. In two behavioral experiments (total <I>n</I> = 113; 72 female), the disparity between congruent and incongruent response times was exaggerated for olfactory relative to visual targets, indicating a greater dependency on predictive verbal cues to process olfactory targets. A preregistered fMRI study (<I>n</I> = 30; 19 female) revealed the anterior cingulate cortex (a region central for error detection) being more activated by incongruent olfactory targets, indicating a role for olfactory predictive error processing. Additionally, both the primary olfactory and visual cortices were significantly activated for incongruent olfactory targets, suggesting olfactory prediction errors are dependent on cross-sensory processing resources, whereas visual prediction errors are not. We propose that olfaction is characterized by a strong dependency on predictive (nonolfactory) cues and that odors are evaluated in the context of such predictions by a designated transmodal cortical network. Our results indicate differences in how predictive cues are used by different senses in rapid decision-making.</p>

                <p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique gaining more attention in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of NDDs, tDCS is unlikely to be equally effective in all individuals. The present study aimed to establish neuroanatomical markers in typically developing (TD) individuals that may be used for the prediction of individual responses to tDCS. Fifty-seven male and female children received 2&nbsp;mA anodal and sham tDCS, targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC<SUB>left</SUB>), right inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral temporoparietal junction. Response to tDCS was assessed based on task performance differences between anodal and sham tDCS in different neurocognitive tasks (<I>N</I>-back, flanker, Mooney faces detection, attentional emotional recognition task). Measures of cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) were derived from 3 Tesla structural MRI scans. Associations between neuroanatomy and task performance were assessed using general linear models (GLM). Machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to predict responses to tDCS. Vertex-wise estimates of SA were more closely linked to differences in task performance than measures of CT. Across ML algorithms, highest accuracies were observed for the prediction of <I>N</I>-back task performance differences following stimulation of the DLPFC<SUB>left</SUB>, where 65% of behavioral variance was explained by variability in SA. Lower accuracies were observed for all other tasks and stimulated regions. This suggests that it may be possible to predict individual responses to tDCS for some behavioral measures and target regions. In the future, these models might be extended to predict treatment outcome in individuals with NDDs.</p>

                <p>In competitive interactions, humans have to flexibly update their beliefs about another person's intentions in order to adjust their own choice strategy, such as when believing that the other may exploit their cooperativeness. Here we investigate both the neural dynamics and the causal neural substrate of belief updating processes in humans. We used an adapted prisoner's dilemma game in which participants explicitly predicted the coplayer's actions, which allowed us to quantify the prediction error between expected and actual behavior. First, in an EEG experiment, we found a stronger medial frontal negativity (MFN) for negative than positive prediction errors, suggesting that this medial frontal ERP component may encode unexpected defection of the coplayer. The MFN also predicted subsequent belief updating after negative prediction errors. In a second experiment, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate whether the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) causally implements belief updating after unexpected outcomes. Our results show that dmPFC TMS impaired belief updating and strategic behavioral adjustments after negative prediction errors. Taken together, our findings reveal the time course of the use of prediction errors in social decisions and suggest that the dmPFC plays a crucial role in updating mental representations of others' intentions.</p>

                <p>Most of mammalian physiology is under the control of biological rhythms, including the endocrine system with time-varying hormone secretion. Precision neuroimaging studies provide unique insights into how the endocrine system dynamically regulates aspects of the human brain. Recently, we established estrogen's ability to drive widespread patterns of connectivity and enhance the global efficiency of large-scale brain networks in a woman sampled every 24&nbsp;h across 30 consecutive days, capturing a complete menstrual cycle. Steroid hormone production also follows a pronounced sinusoidal pattern, with a peak in testosterone between 6 and 7 A.M. and nadir between 7 and 8 P.M. To capture the brain's response to diurnal changes in hormone production, we carried out a companion precision imaging study of a healthy adult man who completed MRI and venipuncture every 12&ndash;24&nbsp;h across 30 consecutive days. Results confirmed robust diurnal fluctuations in testosterone, 17&beta;-estradiol&mdash;the primary form of estrogen&mdash;and cortisol. Standardized regression analyses revealed widespread associations between testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol concentrations and whole-brain patterns of coherence. In particular, functional connectivity in the Dorsal Attention Network was coupled with diurnally fluctuating hormones. Further, comparing dense-sampling datasets between a man and a naturally cycling woman revealed that fluctuations in sex hormones are tied to patterns of whole-brain coherence in both sexes and to a heightened degree in the male. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of steroid hormones as rapid neuromodulators and provide evidence that diurnal changes in steroid hormones are associated with patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity.</p>

                <p>When performing movements in rapid succession, the brain needs to coordinate ongoing execution with the preparation of an upcoming action. Here we identify the processes and brain areas involved in this ability of online preparation. Human participants (both male and female) performed pairs of single-finger presses or three-finger chords in rapid succession, while 7T fMRI was recorded. In the overlap condition, they could prepare the second movement during the first response and in the nonoverlap condition only after the first response was completed. Despite matched perceptual and movement requirements, fMRI revealed increased brain activity in the overlap condition in regions along the intraparietal sulcus and ventral visual stream. Multivariate analyses suggested that these areas are involved in stimulus identification and action selection. In contrast, the dorsal premotor cortex, known to be involved in planning upcoming movements, showed no discernible signs of heightened activity. This observation suggests that the bottleneck during simultaneous action execution and preparation arises at the level of stimulus identification and action selection, whereas movement planning in the premotor cortex can unfold concurrently with the execution of a current action without requiring additional neural activity.</p>

                <p>In developmental language disorder (DLD), learning to comprehend and express oneself with spoken language is impaired, but the reason for this remains unknown. Using millisecond-scale magnetoencephalography recordings combined with machine learning models, we investigated whether the possible neural basis of this disruption lies in poor cortical tracking of speech. The stimuli were common spoken Finnish words (e.g., dog, car, hammer) and sounds with corresponding meanings (e.g., dog bark, car engine, hammering). In both children with DLD (10 boys and 7 girls) and typically developing (TD) control children (14 boys and 3 girls), aged 10&ndash;15&nbsp;years, the cortical activation to spoken words was best modeled as time-locked to the unfolding speech input at ~100&nbsp;ms latency between sound and cortical activation. Amplitude envelope (amplitude changes) and spectrogram (detailed time-varying spectral content) of the spoken words, but not other sounds, were very successfully decoded based on time-locked brain responses in bilateral temporal areas; based on the cortical responses, the models could tell at ~75&ndash;85% accuracy which of the two sounds had been presented to the participant. However, the cortical representation of the amplitude envelope information was poorer in children with DLD compared with TD children at longer latencies (at ~200&ndash;300&nbsp;ms lag). We interpret this effect as reflecting poorer retention of acoustic&ndash;phonetic information in short-term memory. This impaired tracking could potentially affect the processing and learning of words as well as continuous speech. The present results offer an explanation for the problems in language comprehension and acquisition in DLD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/22/e2180232024?rss=1">Perception and Memory Reinstatement Engage Overlapping Face-Selective Regions within Human Ventral Temporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans have the remarkable ability to vividly retrieve sensory details of past events. According to the theory of sensory reinstatement, during remembering, brain regions specialized for processing specific sensory stimuli are reactivated to support content-specific retrieval. Recently, several studies have emphasized transformations in the spatial organization of these reinstated activity patterns. Specifically, studies of scene stimuli suggest a clear anterior shift in the location of retrieval activations compared with the activity observed during perception. However, it is not clear that such transformations occur universally, with inconsistent evidence for other important stimulus categories, particularly faces. One challenge in addressing this question is the careful delineation of face-selective cortices, which are interdigitated with other selective regions, in configurations that spatially differ across individuals. Therefore, we conducted a multisession neuroimaging study to first carefully map individual participants&rsquo; (nine males and seven females) face-selective regions within ventral temporal cortex (VTC), followed by a second session to examine the activity patterns within these regions during face memory encoding and retrieval. While face-selective regions were expectedly engaged during face perception at encoding, memory retrieval engagement exhibited a more selective and constricted reinstatement pattern within these regions, but did not show any consistent direction of spatial transformation (e.g., anteriorization). We also report on unique human intracranial recordings from VTC under the same experimental conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering the complex configuration of category-selective cortex in elucidating principles shaping the neural transformations that occur from perception to memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/22/e2223232024?rss=1">The Brains Topographical Organization Shapes Dynamic Interaction Patterns That Support Flexible Behavior Based on Rules and Long-Term Knowledge</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behavior relies both on specific rules that vary across situations and stable long-term knowledge gained from experience. The frontoparietal control network (FPCN) is implicated in the brain's ability to balance these different influences on action. Here, we investigate how the topographical organization of the cortex supports behavioral flexibility within the FPCN. Functional properties of this network might reflect its juxtaposition between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN), two large-scale systems implicated in top-down attention and memory-guided cognition, respectively. Our study tests whether subnetworks of FPCN are topographically proximal to the DAN and the DMN, respectively, and how these topographical differences relate to functional differences: the proximity of each subnetwork is anticipated to play a pivotal role in generating distinct cognitive modes relevant to working memory and long-term memory. We show that FPCN subsystems share multiple anatomical and functional similarities with their neighboring systems (DAN and DMN) and that this topographical architecture supports distinct interaction patterns that give rise to different patterns of functional behavior. The FPCN acts as a unified system when long-term knowledge supports behavior but becomes segregated into discrete subsystems with different patterns of interaction when long-term memory is less relevant. In this way, our study suggests that the topographical organization of the FPCN and the connections it forms with distant regions of cortex are important influences on how this system supports flexible behavior.</p>

                <p>Spinal cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) form an evolutionary conserved bipolar cell population localized around the central canal of all vertebrates. CSF-cNs were shown to express molecular markers of neuronal immaturity into adulthood; however, the impact of their incomplete maturation on the chloride (Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>) homeostasis as well as GABAergic signaling remains unknown. Using adult mice from both sexes, in situ hybridization revealed that a proportion of spinal CSF-cNs (18.3%) express the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) allowing intracellular Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> accumulation. However, we did not find expression of the K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter 2 (KCC2) responsible for Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> efflux in any CSF-cNs. The lack of KCC2 expression results in low Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> extrusion capacity in CSF-cNs under high Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> load in whole-cell patch clamp. Using cell-attached patch clamp allowing recordings with intact intracellular Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> concentration, we found that the activation of ionotropic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-Rs) induced both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses in CSF-cNs. Moreover, depolarizing GABA responses can drive action potentials as well as intracellular calcium elevations by activating voltage-gated calcium channels. Blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide inhibited the GABA-induced calcium transients in CSF-cNs. Finally, we show that metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors have no hyperpolarizing action on spinal CSF-cNs as their activation with baclofen did not mediate outward K<sup>+</sup> currents, presumably due to the lack of expression of G-protein&ndash;coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Together, these findings outline subpopulations of spinal CSF-cNs expressing inhibitory or excitatory GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R signaling. Excitatory GABA may promote the maturation and integration of young CSF-cNs into the existing spinal circuit.</p>

                <p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates the body's physiology, including cardiovascular function. As the ANS develops during the second to third trimester, fetal heart rate variability (HRV) increases while fetal heart rate (HR) decreases. In this way, fetal HR and HRV provide an index of fetal ANS development and future neurobehavioral regulation. Fetal HR and HRV have been associated with child language ability and psychomotor development behavior in toddlerhood. However, their associations with postbirth autonomic brain systems, such as the brainstem, hypothalamus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), have yet to be investigated even though brain pathways involved in autonomic regulation are well established in older individuals. We assessed whether fetal HR and HRV were associated with the brainstem, hypothalamic, and dACC functional connectivity in newborns. Data were obtained from 60 pregnant individuals (ages 14&ndash;42) at 24&ndash;27 and 34&ndash;37&nbsp;weeks of gestation using a fetal actocardiograph to generate fetal HR and HRV. During natural sleep, their infants (38 males and 22 females) underwent a fMRI scan between 40 and 46&nbsp;weeks of postmenstrual age. Our findings relate fetal heart indices to brainstem, hypothalamic, and dACC connectivity and reveal connections with widespread brain regions that may support behavioral and emotional regulation. We demonstrated the basic physiologic association between fetal HR indices and lower- and higher-order brain regions involved in regulatory processes. This work provides the foundation for future behavioral or physiological regulation research in fetuses and infants.</p>

                Background This study compares propellant fuels’ specific thrust and impulse parameters using nanocarbon variant fuels from coconut shells and coal. Specific impulses and impulses are essential parameters that determine rocket performance. The specific thrust and impulses are influenced by fuel type, material composition, heat flow, and burning time parameters. The characteristics of nanocarbon as a fuel are proven to have high-value features and a long combustion time. This parameter is essential to add value to specific thrusts and impulses. Methods The method to prove the quality of solid fuel material was done experimentally. The composition of the propellant fuel variant mixed with Ammonium Perchlorate (NH4ClO4) as an oxidizer through the printing process and sample testing was carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), combustion time, and specific impulse tests. Results Test results with the composition of CBK2 (Coconut Shell + NH4ClO4 + Binder + Al = 15: 70: 10: 5) produced a specific impulse of 267 seconds or an increase of 37 seconds without carbon. CBB2 (Coal + NH4ClO4 + Binder + Al = 15: 70: 10: 5) produced a specific impulse of 261 seconds or an increase of 31 seconds. Conclusions The composition of nanocarbon as a solid fuel propellant has been proven to increase a rocket’s thrust and specific impulses. After all the material variants have been tested for thrust and specific impulse, the best rocket propellant is CBK2.

We apply expectation-maximization to infer the specificity of RBPs, represented as position-specific weight matrices (PWMs), by maximizing the likelihood of RNA Bind’n Seq data from the ENCODE project. Analyzing these public data we find sequence motifs that can partly explain the data for more than half of the studied 111 RBPs, and for 48 of the proteins these motifs are consistent with the known specificity. Our code is publicly available, facilitating analysis of RBP binding data.

The field of 3D genome organization produces large amounts of sequencing data from Hi-C and a rapidly-expanding set of other chromosome conformation protocols (3C+). Massive and heterogeneous 3C+ data require high-performance and flexible processing of sequenced reads into contact pairs. To meet these challenges, we present <i>pairtools</i>–a flexible suite of tools for contact extraction from sequencing data. <i>Pairtools</i> provides modular command-line interface (CLI) tools that can be flexibly chained into data processing pipelines. The core operations provided by <i>pairtools</i> are parsing of.sam alignments into Hi-C pairs, sorting and removal of PCR duplicates. In addition, <i>pairtools</i> provides auxiliary tools for building feature-rich 3C+ pipelines, including contact pair manipulation, filtration, and quality control. Benchmarking <i>pairtools</i> against popular 3C+ data pipelines shows advantages of <i>pairtools</i> for high-performance and flexible 3C+ analysis. Finally, <i>pairtools</i> provides protocol-specific tools for restriction-based protocols, haplotype-resolved contacts, and single-cell Hi-C. The combination of CLI tools and tight integration with Python data analysis libraries makes <i>pairtools</i> a versatile foundation for a broad range of 3C+ pipelines.

                <p>by Kerr Ding, Jiaqi Luo, Yunan Luo</p>

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.

                <p>by Kanyarat Jitmana, Jason I. Griffiths, Sian Fereday, Anna DeFazio, David Bowtell, for Australian Ovarian Cancer Study , Frederick R. Adler</p>

A time-series analysis of serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125)levels was performed in 791 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study to evaluate the development of chemoresistance and response to therapy. To investigate chemoresistance and better predict the treatment effectiveness, we examined two traits: <i>resistance</i> (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were treated with therapy) and <i>aggressiveness</i> (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were not treated). We found that as the number of treatment lines increases, the data-based resistance increases (a decreased rate of CA-125 decay). We use mathematical models of two distinct cancer cell types, treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells, to estimate the values and evolution of the two traits in individual patients. By fitting to individual patient HGSOC data, our models successfully capture the dynamics of the CA-125 level. The parameters estimated from the mathematical models show that patients with inferred low growth rates of treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated aggressiveness) and a high death rate of treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated resistance) have longer survival time after completing their second-line of therapy. These findings show that mathematical models can characterize the degree of <i>resistance</i> and <i>aggressiveness</i> in individual patients, which improves our understanding of chemoresistance development and could predict treatment effectiveness in HGSOC patients.

                <p>by Andriana Manousidaki, Anna Little, Yuying Xie</p>

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution characterization of tissue and cancer compositions. Although numerous tools for dimension reduction and clustering are available for single-cell data analyses, these methods often fail to simultaneously preserve local cluster structure and global data geometry. To address these challenges, we developed a novel analyses framework, Single-Cell Path Metrics Profiling (scPMP), using power-weighted path metrics, which measure distances between cells in a data-driven way. Unlike Euclidean distance and other commonly used distance metrics, path metrics are density sensitive and respect the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which preserves both the global data geometry and cluster structure. We evaluate the method both for clustering quality and geometric fidelity, and it outperforms current scRNAseq clustering algorithms on a wide range of benchmarking data sets.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1448/v3?src=rss">COVID-19 in the Arab countries: Three-year study [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

                Background Caring for a child with long-term functional limitations can have a negative impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the caregiver. Family-centered care (FCC) interventions have the potential to empower caregivers and contribute to their well-being. This systematic review aimed to synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of FCC interventions in improving the well-being of caregivers of children with cerebral palsy (CP), and identify the key components of such interventions that are most commonly practiced and deemed effective. Methods This review systematically searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of any FCC intervention on the well-being of caregivers of children with or at risk of CP. We used the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool to assess risk of bias and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for critical appraisal. Due to high heterogeneity of studies, narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data. Results The review consists of 11 studies which were categorized into five sections based on the components of FCC intervention provided in each individual study: 1. Information provision, and Enabling and partnership (n= 5); 2. Information provision, and Respectful and supportive care (n= 1); 3. Enabling and partnership (n= 2); 4. Enabling and partnership, and Respectful and supportive care (n= 2); 5. Information provision, Enabling and partnership and Respectful and supportive care (n= 1). Risk of bias was low in four studies, unclear in two studies, and high in five studies. Conclusion FCC interventions were found to be effective in improving caregivers’ satisfaction with attainment of child and caregiver goals. Evidence from multiple studies does not strongly support the effectiveness of FCC interventions on caregiver’s mental health, parenting and personal outcomes. Limited evidence precludes a conclusion on the effectiveness of the components of FCC on well-being of caregivers of children with CP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-255/v3?src=rss">The identification of retro-DNAs in primate genomes as DNA transposons mobilizing via retrotransposition [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Mobile elements (MEs) constitute a major portion of the genome in primates and other higher eukaryotes, and they play important role in genome evolution and gene function. MEs can be divided into two fundamentally different classes: DNA transposons which transpose in the genome in a “cut-and-paste” style, and retrotransposons which propagate in a “copy-and-paste” fashion via a process involving transcription and reverse-transcription. In primate genomes, DNA transposons are mostly dead, while many retrotransposons are still highly active. We report here the identification of a unique group of MEs, which we call “retro-DNAs”, for their combined characteristics of these two fundamentally different ME classes. Methods A comparative computational genomic approach was used to analyze the reference genome sequences of 10 primate species consisting of five apes, four monkeys, and marmoset. Results From our analysis, we identified a total of 1,750 retro-DNAs, representing 748 unique insertion events in the genomes of ten primate species including human. These retro-DNAs contain sequences of DNA transposons but lack the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the hallmark of DNA transposons. Instead, they show characteristics of retrotransposons, such as polyA tails, longer target-site duplications (TSDs), and the “TT/AAAA” insertion site motif, suggesting the use of the L1-based target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) mechanism. At least 40% of these retro-DNAs locate into genic regions, presenting potentials for impacting gene function. More interestingly, some retro-DNAs, as well as their parent sites, show certain levels of expression, suggesting that they have the potential to create more retro-DNA copies in the present primate genomes. Conclusions Although small in number, the identification of these retro-DNAs reveals a new mean for propagating DNA transposons in primate genomes without active canonical DNA transposon activity. Our data also suggest that the TPRT machinery may transpose a wider variety of DNA sequences in the genomes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a critical inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that plays a vital role in modulating neuronal excitability. Dysregulation of GABAergic signaling, particularly involving the cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2, has been implicated in various pathologies, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, and ischemia. NKCC1 facilitates chloride influx, whereas KCC2 mediates chloride efflux via potassium gradient. Altered expression and function of these cotransporters have been associated with excitotoxicity, inflammation, and cellular death in ischemic events characterized by reduced cerebral blood flow, leading to compromised tissue metabolism and subsequent cell death. NKCC1 inhibition has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate intracellular chloride accumulation and mitigate neuronal damage during ischemic events. Similarly, targeting KCC2, which regulates chloride efflux, holds promise for improving outcomes and reducing neuronal damage under ischemic conditions. This review emphasizes the critical roles of GABA, NKCC1, and KCC2 in ischemic pathologies and their potential as therapeutic targets. Inhibiting or modulating the activity of these cotransporters represents a promising strategy for reducing neuronal damage, preventing excitotoxicity, and improving neurological outcomes following ischemic events. Furthermore, exploring the interactions between natural compounds and NKCC1/KCC2 provides additional avenues for potential therapeutic interventions for ischemic injury.</p>

Instead, ECM signaling from Lamin-mutant cardiomyocytes is predicted to initiate an inflammatory response.

Phosphoproteomics reveals putative substrates of CDPK5. Kinase deletion reduces parasite virulence, disease severity, and oocyst shedding and thus identifies a potential target for blocking disease transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93357">Reactivation strength during cued recall is modulated by graph distance within cognitive maps</a></h4>

              
                Declarative memory retrieval is thought to involve reinstatement of neuronal activity patterns elicited and encoded during a prior learning episode. Furthermore, it is suggested that two mechanisms operate during reinstatement, dependent on task demands: individual memory items can be reactivated simultaneously as a clustered occurrence or, alternatively, replayed sequentially as temporally separate instances. In the current study, participants learned associations between images that were embedded in a directed graph network and retained this information over a brief 8 min consolidation period. During a subsequent cued recall session, participants retrieved the learned information while undergoing magnetoencephalographic recording. Using a trained stimulus decoder, we found evidence for clustered reactivation of learned material. Reactivation strength of individual items during clustered reactivation decreased as a function of increasing graph distance, an ordering present solely for successful retrieval but not for retrieval failure. In line with previous research, we found evidence that sequential replay was dependent on retrieval performance and was most evident in low performers. The results provide evidence for distinct performance-dependent retrieval mechanisms, with graded clustered reactivation emerging as a plausible mechanism to search within abstract cognitive maps.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92511">mitoBKCa is functionally expressed in murine and human breast cancer cells and potentially contributes to metabolic reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in the function of K<sup>+</sup> channels such as the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel of large conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) reportedly promote breast cancer (BC) development and progression. Underlying molecular mechanisms remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variant localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine and human BC cells (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>). Through a combination of genetic knockdown and knockout along with a cell permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel blocker, we show that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates overall cellular and mitochondrial energy production, and mediates the metabolic rewiring referred to as the ‘Warburg effect’, thereby promoting BC cell proliferation in the presence and absence of oxygen. Additionally, we detect mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in low or high abundance, respectively, in clinical BC specimens. Together, our results emphasize, that targeting mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> could represent a treatment strategy for selected BC patients in future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91429">Tuning apicobasal polarity and junctional recycling in the hemogenic endothelium orchestrates the morphodynamic complexity of emerging pre-hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic stem cells emerge in the embryo from an aortic-derived tissue called the hemogenic endothelium (HE). The HE appears to give birth to cells of different nature and fate but the molecular principles underlying this complexity are largely unknown. Here we show, in the zebrafish embryo, that two cell types emerge from the aortic floor with radically different morphodynamics. With the support of live imaging, we bring evidence suggesting that the mechanics underlying the two emergence types rely, or not, on apicobasal polarity establishment. While the first type is characterized by reinforcement of apicobasal polarity and maintenance of the apical/luminal membrane until release, the second type emerges via a dynamic process reminiscent of trans-endothelial migration. Interfering with Runx1 function suggests that the balance between the two emergence types depends on tuning apicobasal polarity at the level of the HE. In support of this and unexpectedly, we show that Pard3ba – one of the four Pard3 proteins expressed in the zebrafish – is sensitive to interference with Runx1 activity, in aortic endothelial cells. This supports the idea of a signaling cross talk controlling cell polarity and its associated features, between aortic and hemogenic cells. In addition, using new transgenic fish lines that express Junctional Adhesion Molecules and functional interference, we bring evidence for the essential role of ArhGEF11/PDZ-RhoGEF in controlling the HE-endothelial cell dynamic interface, including cell-cell intercalation, which is ultimately required for emergence completion. Overall, we highlight critical cellular and dynamic events of the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition that support emergence complexity, with a potential impact on cell fate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94167">Pan-cortical 2-photon mesoscopic imaging and neurobehavioral alignment in awake, behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                The flow of neural activity across the neocortex during active sensory discrimination is constrained by task-specific cognitive demands, movements, and internal states. During behavior, the brain appears to sample from a broad repertoire of activation motifs. Understanding how these patterns of local and global activity are selected in relation to both spontaneous and task-dependent behavior requires in-depth study of densely sampled activity at single neuron resolution across large regions of cortex. In a significant advance toward this goal, we developed procedures to record mesoscale 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data from two novel <i>in vivo</i> preparations that, between them, allow for simultaneous access to nearly all 0f the mouse dorsal and lateral neocortex. As a proof of principle, we aligned neural activity with both behavioral primitives and high-level motifs to reveal the existence of large populations of neurons that coordinated their activity across cortical areas with spontaneous changes in movement and/or arousal. The methods we detail here facilitate the identification and exploration of widespread, spatially heterogeneous neural ensembles whose activity is related to diverse aspects of behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94869">Dual engagement of the nucleosomal acidic patches is essential for deposition of histone H2A.Z by SWR1C</a></h4>

              
                The yeast SWR1C chromatin remodeling enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for the histone variant H2A.Z, a key variant involved in a multitude of nuclear functions. How the 14-subunit SWR1C engages the nucleosomal substrate remains largely unknown. Studies on the ISWI, CHD1, and SWI/SNF families of chromatin remodeling enzymes have demonstrated key roles for the nucleosomal acidic patch for remodeling activity, however a role for this nucleosomal epitope in nucleosome editing by SWR1C has not been tested. Here, we employ a variety of biochemical assays to demonstrate an essential role for the acidic patch in the H2A.Z exchange reaction. Utilizing asymmetrically assembled nucleosomes, we demonstrate that the acidic patches on each face of the nucleosome are required for SWR1C-mediated dimer exchange, suggesting SWR1C engages the nucleosome in a ‘pincer-like’ conformation, engaging both patches simultaneously. Loss of a single acidic patch results in loss of high affinity nucleosome binding and nucleosomal stimulation of ATPase activity. We identify a conserved arginine-rich motif within the Swc5 subunit that binds the acidic patch and is key for dimer exchange activity. In addition, our cryoEM structure of a Swc5–nucleosome complex suggests that promoter proximal, histone H2B ubiquitylation may regulate H2A.Z deposition. Together these findings provide new insights into how SWR1C engages its nucleosomal substrate to promote efficient H2A.Z deposition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76803">Brain representations of motion and position in the double-drift illusion</a></h4>

              
                In the ‘double-drift’ illusion, local motion within a window moving in the periphery of the visual field alters the window’s perceived path. The illusion is strong even when the eyes track a target whose motion matches the window so that the stimulus remains stable on the retina. This implies that the illusion involves the integration of retinal signals with non-retinal eye-movement signals. To identify where in the brain this integration occurs, we measured BOLD fMRI responses in visual cortex while subjects experienced the double-drift illusion. We then used a combination of univariate and multivariate decoding analyses to identify (1) which brain areas were sensitive to the illusion and (2) whether these brain areas contained information about the illusory stimulus trajectory. We identified a number of cortical areas that responded more strongly during the illusion than a control condition that was matched for low-level stimulus properties. Only in area hMT+ was it possible to decode the illusory trajectory. We additionally performed a number of important controls that rule out possible low-level confounds. Concurrent eye tracking confirmed that subjects accurately tracked the moving target; we were unable to decode the illusion trajectory using eye position measurements recorded during fMRI scanning, ruling out explanations based on differences in oculomotor behavior. Our results provide evidence for a perceptual representation in human visual cortex that incorporates extraretinal information.

                The role of the diverse brain cell types in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) development and epileptogenicity is not fully understood. Here, we performed multi-omics single-cell sequencing to characterize the chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes of cortical lesions and non-lesion areas from individuals with FCD IIa and IIb, the most prevalent presentations of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Our integrative analyses of the multimodal cell atlas, encompassing 61,525 nuclei with paired open chromatin and gene expression, uncovered a selective loss of upper-layer excitatory neurons and identified a lesion-specific population expressing NEFM, a neurofilament associated with dysmorphic neurons. In glial compartments, we observed a shift towards immature astrocytic populations exhibiting features of reactive astrocytes and balloon cells. Moreover, we identified activated microglial cell states emerging in FCD IIb, indicating that neuroinflammation contributes to FCD pathogenesis. This multimodal cell atlas is a valuable resource for exploring the cellular landscape and informing novel therapeutic approaches for cortical malformations.

">Attentional propagation of conceptual information in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The visual environment is complicated, and humans and other animals accordingly prioritise some sources of information over others through the deployment of spatial attention. We presume that attention has the ultimate purpose of guiding the abstraction of information from perceptual experience in the development of concepts and categories. However, neuroscientific investigation has focussed closely on identification of the systems and algorithms that support attentional control, or that instantiate the effect of attention on sensation and perception. Much less is known about how attention impacts the acquisition and activation of high-level information in the brain. Here, we use machine learning of EEG and concurrently-recorded EEG/MRI to temporally and anatomically characterise the neural network that abstracts from attended perceptual information to activate and construct semantic and conceptual representations. We find that the trial-wise amplitude of N2pc - an ERP component closely linked to selective attention - predicts the rapid emergence of information about semantic categories in EEG. Similar analysis of EEG/MRI shows that N2pc predicts MRI-derived category information in a network including VMPFC, posterior parietal cortex, and anterior insula. These brain areas appear critically involved in the attention-mediated translation of perceptual information to concepts, semantics, and action plans.

                Neurological and ocular manifestations were reported in COVID-19 patients and in SARS-CoV-2 infected animal models. However, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) on the eyes and the retina remain unclear. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 VoC infection on the eye and retina in mice and hamsters. Infection with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the Gamma VoC induced a subtle increase in the eye volume of K18-hAce2 mice, but no morphological alteration was observed in hamsters eyes. Evaluation of the ocular tropism revealed that distinct SARS-CoV-2 VoC reached the eye globe, but not the retina of K18-hAce2 mice. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 variants are detected in the hamsters retina during both acute infection and after disease recovery. Despite the presence of viral RNA, no inflammation was observed in the hamster retina, as evidenced by unchanged microglial cell density and unaltered gene expression of several immune mediators. Altogether, these findings indicate a limited impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the eye and retina.

                Memory consolidation is highly influenced by ongoing experiences. We explore the temporal rules that determine whether events are cooperatively associated or competitively separated. We show that neutral events are associated with fearful events if they occur within less than 30 minutes. In some individuals, memory association can lead to a competitive suppression of the fearful response by the neutral event. Activation of the thalamic MGm inputs to the lateral amygdala, led to an increase in memory association, whereas manipulation of the cortical inputs had no effect. Introducing a third event leads to competition depending on the temporal relationship between the initial association and the competitive event. Our results show a critical temporal rule of memory association, modulated by thalamic activity that shapes fear memory consolidation.

                The present study investigated the neuromodulatory substrates of salience processing and its impact on memory encoding and behaviour, with a specific focus on two distinct types of salience: reward and contextual unexpectedness. 46 participants performed a novel task paradigm modulating these two aspects independently and allowing for investigating their distinct and interactive effects on memory encoding while undergoing high resolution fMRI. By using advanced image processing techniques tailored to examine midbrain and brainstem nuclei with high precision, our study additionally aimed to elucidate differential activation patterns in subcortical nuclei in response to reward-associated and contextually unexpected stimuli, including distinct pathways involving in particular dopaminergic modulation. We observed a differential involvement of the ventral striatum, substantia nigra and caudate nucleus, as well as a functional specialisation within the subregions of the cingulate cortex for the two salience types. Moreover, distinct subregions within the substantia nigra in processing salience could be identified. Dorsal areas preferentially processed salience related to stimulus processing (of both reward and contextual unexpectedness) versus ventral areas were involved in salience-related memory encoding (for contextual unexpectedness only). These functional specialisations within SN are in line with different projection patterns of dorsal and ventral SN to brain areas supporting attention and memory, respectively. By disentangling stimulus processing and memory encoding related to two salience types, we hope to further consolidate our understanding of neuromodulatory structures differential as well as interactive roles in modulating behavioural responses to salient events.

                Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and demethylases (KDMs) responsible for regulating the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. To study the specific role of H3K4me3 demethylation, we investigated neurodevelopmental phenotypes in mice without KDM5B demethylase activity. These mice exhibited autism-like behaviours and increased brain size. H3K4me3 levels and the expression of neurodevelopmental genes were increased in the developing Kdm5b mutant neocortex. These included elevated expression of Grin2d. The Grin2d gene product NMDAR2D was increased in synaptosomes isolated from the Kdm5b-deficient neocortex and treating mice with the NMDAR antagonist memantine rescued deficits in ultrasonic vocalisations and reduced repetitive digging behaviours. These findings suggest that increased H3K4me3 levels and associated Grin2d gene upregulation disrupt brain development and function, leading to socio-communication deficits and repetitive behaviours, and identify a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with KDM5B deficiency.

                Semantic representation emerges from distributed multisensory modalities, yet a comprehensive understanding of the functional changing pattern within convergence zones or hubs integrating multisensory semantic information remains elusive. In this study, employing information-theoretic metrics, we quantified gesture and speech information, alongside their interaction, utilizing entropy and mutual information (MI). Neural activities were assessed via interruption effects induced by High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Additionally, chronometric double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-temporal event-related potentials were utilized to decipher dynamic neural changes resulting from various information contributors. Results showed gradual inhibition of both inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) as degree of gesture-speech integration, indexed by MI, increased. Moreover, a time-sensitive and staged progression of neural engagement was observed, evidenced by distinct correlations between neural activity patterns and entropy measures of speech and gesture, as well as MI, across early sensory and lexico-semantic processing stages. These findings illuminate the gradual nature of neural activity during multisensory gesture-speech semantic processing, shaped by dynamic gesture constraints and speech encoding, thereby offering insights into the neural mechanisms underlying multisensory language processing.

">Developmental maturation of millimeter-scale functional networks across brain areas</a></h4>

              
                Interacting with the environment to process sensory information, generate perceptions, and shape behavior engages neural networks in brain areas with highly varied representations, ranging from unimodal sensory cortices to higher-order association areas. Recent work suggests a much greater degree of commonality across areas, with distributed and modular networks present in both sensory and non-sensory areas during early development. However, it is currently unknown whether this initially common modular structure undergoes an equally common developmental trajectory, or whether such a modular functional organization persists in some areas -- such as primary visual cortex -- but not others. Here we examine the development of network organization across diverse cortical regions in ferrets of both sexes using in vivo widefield calcium imaging of spontaneous activity. We find that all regions examined, including both primary sensory cortices (visual, auditory, and somatosensory -- V1, A1, and S1, respectively) and higher order association areas (prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices) exhibit a largely similar pattern of changes over an approximately 3 week developmental period spanning eye opening and the transition to predominantly externally-driven sensory activity. We find that both a modular functional organization and millimeter-scale correlated networks remain present across all cortical areas examined. These networks weakened over development in most cortical areas, but strengthened in V1. Overall, the conserved maintenance of modular organization across different cortical areas suggests a common pathway of network refinement, and suggests that a modular organization -- known to encode functional representations in visual areas -- may be similarly engaged in highly diverse brain areas.

">Autism gene variants disrupt enteric neuron migration and cause gastrointestinal dysmotility</a></h4>

              
                The comorbidity of autism spectrum disorders and severe gastrointestinal symptoms is well- established, yet the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. The identification of high-confidence large-effect autism risk genes offers the opportunity to identify convergent, underlying biology by studying these genes in the context of the gastrointestinal system. Here we show that the expression of these genes is enriched in human prenatal gut neurons as well as their migratory progenitors, suggesting that the development and/or function of these neurons may be disrupted by autism-associated pathogenic variants, leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Here we document the prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in patients with large-effect variants in sixteen of these genes, highlighting dysmotility, consistent with potential enteric neuron dysfunction. Using the high- throughput diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis, we individually target five of these genes (SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, CHD2, and DYRK1A) and observe disrupted enteric neuronal progenitor migration for each. More extensive analysis of DYRK1A reveals that perturbation causes gut dysmotility in vivo, which can be ameliorated by treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) or a serotonin receptor 6 agonist, identified by in vivo drug screening. This work suggests that atypical development of enteric neurons contributes to the gastrointestinal distress commonly seen in individuals with autism and that increasing serotonin signaling may be a productive therapeutic avenue.

	<p>Protein kinase C (PKC) is a diverse enzyme family crucial for cell signalling in various organs. Its dysregulation is linked to numerous diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological problems. In the brain, PKC plays pivotal roles in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and neuronal survival. Specifically, PKC&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) pathogenesis is of significant interest. The dysregulation of PKC signalling has been linked to neurological disorders, including AD. This review elucidates PKC&amp;amp;rsquo;s pivotal role in neurological health, particularly its implications in AD pathogenesis and chronic alcohol addiction. AD, characterised by neurodegeneration, implicates PKC dysregulation in synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Conversely, chronic alcohol consumption elicits neural adaptations intertwined with PKC signalling, exacerbating addictive behaviours. By unravelling PKC&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in these afflictions, potential therapeutic avenues emerge, offering promise for ameliorating their debilitating effects. This review navigates the complex interplay between PKC, AD pathology, and alcohol addiction, illuminating pathways for future neurotherapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are examples of neurodegenerative movement disorders (NMDs), which are defined by a gradual loss of motor function that is frequently accompanied by cognitive decline. Although genetic abnormalities have long been acknowledged as significant factors, new research indicates that epigenetic alterations are crucial for the initiation and development of disease. This review delves into the complex interactions that exist between the pathophysiology of NMDs and epigenetic mechanisms such DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Here, we examine how these epigenetic changes could affect protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and gene expression patterns, thereby influencing the viability and functionality of neurons. Through the clarification of the epigenetic terrain underpinning neurodegenerative movement disorders, this review seeks to enhance comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of the illness and augment the creation of innovative therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Anthropometric measures at birth, indexing prenatal growth, are associated with later cognitive development. Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are at elevated risk for impaired prenatal and early postnatal growth and enduring cognitive deficits. However, the associations of neonatal physical growth with neural activity are not well-characterized in LMIC contexts, given the dearth of early childhood neuroimaging research in these settings. The current study examined birth length, weight, and head circumference as predictors of EEG relative power over the first three years of life in rural Limpopo Province, South Africa, controlling for postnatal growth and socioeconomic status (SES). A larger head circumference at birth predicted lower relative gamma power, lower right hemisphere relative beta power, and higher relative alpha and theta power. A greater birth length also predicted lower relative gamma power. There were interactions with timepoints such that the associations of birth head circumference and length with EEG power were most pronounced at the 7-month assessment and were attenuated at the 17- and 36-month assessments. The results identify birth head circumference and length as specific predictors of infant neural activity within an under-resourced context.</p>

	<p>Restrictive dieters are those who expect to achieve body shape and weight control through dieting. However, they often have difficulty suppressing the desire to consume food when confronted with it. It has been shown that when high- and low-calorie foods are presented together, the attention of restrictive eaters is preferentially directed to high-calorie foods. However, whether attentional bias occurs when low-calorie foods are present alone and whether the allocation of attentional resources is consistent with that for high-calorie foods has yet to be explored. The present study focused on the effects of high-/low-calorie foods on attentional bias in restrictive dieters. Seventy-eight participants were recruited to participate in the experiment via the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) scale, which is administered in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. The results revealed that failed restrictive dieters had the lowest percentage of correct answers at the lag2 level, indicating attentional bias. Failed restrictive dieters allocated more attentional resources to high-calorie foods than to low-calorie foods. Restrictive dieters showed no attentional bias when low-calorie foods were presented alone. The results suggest that low-calorie foods do not elicit an attentional bias in restrictive dieters and that the allocation of attentional resources is not consistent when compared to that for high-calorie foods.</p>

                Background Head injuries are considered as a silent epidemic due to the high incidence rate throughout the world. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with head injury is cerebral edema which is defined as abnormal fluid accumulation in the brain parenchyma. Mannitol is a hyperosmolar solution given to reduce fluid volume in the brain. Increased high intracranial pressure can affect prognosis and can be evaluated by assessing clinical outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury using the Glasgow Outcome Discharge Scale (GODS) instrument. Methods Observational analytical study with a cross sectional design on 50 patients with severe traumatic brain injury at dr. Zainoel Abidin General Hospital Banda Aceh to determine the effect of mannitol use on the clinical outcomes of severe traumatic brain injury patients which used t test analysis. Results The mean value of the group that received mannitol had a higher GODS score than the group that did not receive mannitol. The results of the T test between groups obtained a p value of 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05, so it can be concluded that the use of mannitol has an effect on the GODS score in Severe traumatic brain injury patients. The results showed that the mean GODS value in patients who received mannitol was higher than those who did not receive mannitol. Conclusion This concludes that the administration of mannitol is effective in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury at dr. Zainoel Abidin General Hospital Banda Aceh.

                Background The objectives of the study were to assess the quality of life (QOL) among women with breast cancer and associate the QOL with selected background variables. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was adopted for the study. Data collection was done in oncology units of tertiary care centers. The sample type includes woman with breast cancer at stage I or II or IIIa as per TNM classification. A purposive sampling technique was followed with a total sample size of 60. The tool used was the Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire - Breast Cancer Version by National Medical Center & Beckman Research institute. Results The QOL among study participants revealed that 42 (70%) had average QOL and 18 (30%) had poor QOL. The QOL was examined in various domains such as physical wellbeing, where the mean score was 38.47, the psychological wellbeing mean score was 60.58, social wellbeing mean was 38.10 and spiritual wellbeing mean was 38.58. There was an association between residence and occupation with QOL at p<0.05. Further there was an association between the clinical variable such as period and stages of cancer at p<0.05 and type of treatment at p<0.01. Conclusions Breast cancer diagnosis has an undeniable effect on women at work, home and can have rapid consequences for other members in the family. Evaluation of QOL and associated factors would help the health care professionals especially nurses to organize health promotion activities and counselling sessions in varied health care settings to overcome challenges and improve Quality of Life.

                <p>What factors are associated with career outcomes among biomedical PhDs? Research to date has focused on drivers of interest in (and intention to pursue) various careers, especially during graduate school, but fewer studies have investigated participants&rsquo; ultimate career outcomes. Even less is known about what factors matter for groups historically underrepresented in the US science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, such as women, some racial and ethnic groups, and persons with disabilities (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B94">National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), 2021a</cross-ref>). This study reports a new analysis of data from 781 PhD neuroscientists that were obtained from a retrospective survey (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B96">Ullrich et al., 2021</cross-ref>) to investigate the factors that influence the career sector in which neuroscience PhDs are employed and whether there were group differences according to social identity. We find evidence of academia as a "default path" for incoming PhD students, but interest in different careers increases over time. Those who remained in academia had greater acceptance of the structural aspects of academic careers, such as promotion and tenure processes, and greater faculty support during postdoctoral training. Conversely, prioritizing monetary compensation and/or varied work were associated with not being in academia, while a strong interest in research was positively associated with being in nonacademic research. Somewhat surprisingly, there were few interactions with gender, and no interactions with underrepresentation status, although perhaps this was due to lower statistical power for these analyses. Our findings also underscore the role of advisors, networking, and personal relationships in securing employment in STEM.</p>

                <p>A hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the appearance of correlated oscillatory discharge throughout the cortico-basal ganglia (BG) circuits. In the primate globus pallidus (GP), where the discharge of GP neurons is normally uncorrelated, pairs of GP neurons exhibit oscillatory spike correlations with a broad distribution of pairwise phase delays in experimental parkinsonism. The transition to oscillatory correlations is thought to indicate the collapse of the normally segregated information channels traversing the BG. The large phase delays are thought to reflect pathological changes in synaptic connectivity in the BG. Here we study the structure and phase delays of spike correlations measured from neurons in the mouse external GP (GPe) subjected to identical 1&ndash;100&nbsp;Hz sinusoidal drive but recorded in separate experiments. First, we found that spectral modes of a GPe neuron's empirical instantaneous phase response curve (iPRC) elucidate at what phases of the oscillatory drive the GPe neuron locks when it is entrained and the distribution of phases at which it spikes when it is not. Then, we show that in this case the pairwise spike cross-correlation equals the cross-correlation function of these spike phase distributions. Finally, we show that the distribution of GPe phase delays arises from the diversity of iPRCs and is broadened when the neurons become entrained. Modeling GPe networks with realistic intranuclear connectivity demonstrates that the connectivity decorrelates GPe neurons without affecting phase delays. Thus, common oscillatory input gives rise to GPe correlations whose structure and pairwise phase delays reflect their intrinsic properties captured by their iPRCs.</p>

                <p>Norepinephrine (NE), a neuromodulator released by locus ceruleus (LC) neurons throughout the cortex, influences arousal and learning through extrasynaptic vesicle exocytosis. While NE within cortical regions has been viewed as a homogenous field, recent studies have demonstrated heterogeneous axonal dynamics and advances in GPCR-based fluorescent sensors permit direct observation of the local dynamics of NE at cellular scale. To investigate how the spatiotemporal dynamics of NE release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) affect neuronal firing, we employed in vivo two-photon imaging of layer 2/3 of the PFC in order to observe fine-scale neuronal calcium and NE dynamics concurrently. In this proof of principle study, we found that local and global NE fields can decouple from one another, providing a substrate for local NE spatiotemporal activity patterns. Optic flow analysis revealed putative release and reuptake events which can occur at the same location, albeit at different times, indicating the potential to create a heterogeneous NE field. Utilizing generalized linear models, we demonstrated that cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations are influenced by both the local and global NE field. However, during periods of local/global NE field decoupling, the local field drives cell firing dynamics rather than the global field. These findings underscore the significance of localized, phasic NE fluctuations for structuring cell firing, which may provide local neuromodulatory control of cortical activity.</p>

                Mesothelioma remains an under-researched cancerous disease due to the lack of high-quality patient samples and clinical information especially outcomes and asbestos exposure data. The National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) is a biobank in which mesothelioma annotated biospecimens can be made widely available to the research community. Here, we summarized the significant research findings from 20 publications that utilized the NMVB samples for novel biomarker and therapeutic discoveries. The results showed that the use of the NMVB resource was dispersed among a variety of basic science topics including, but not limited to, biomarkers, abnormal gene expression, and potential therapeutic targets. Positive biomarkers included several miRNAs and antibodies, HMGB1, ATG5, PIAS3, pancytokeratin and GATA3. Genes that had mutations or high/low levels of expression were BAP1, a human control gene of importance in this disease, as well as various cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors TM4SF1, PKM2, ARHGDIA, COBLL1, WT1, FOXM1, and CD30. Treatments investigated include thiostrepton, interferon-β gene, and Brentuximab. Publications reviewed indicated a significant impact of the NMVB resource utilized in significant studies focusing on biomarker and therapeutic discoveries, which can act as a model for rare diseases, especially in oncology.

                This article attempts to explore the synthetic relationship between group identities and their effects on cultural memory in Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments. It will investigate how Atwood’s dystopian fiction conspicuously weaves threads of cultural identity in the totalitarian society. While examining the work, the researchers found three forms of Memory Figures channelizing society: Architecture and time, Identical groupings, and Language. With significant attention to the prequel, The Handmaid’s Tale, this article will consider The Testaments for the dissection of hard-wired cultural memory formation. This article focuses on how a politically unsettled society of Gilead, through its Memory Figures, inscribes a cultural narrative while instructing individual memories. Atwood’s usage of these Memory Figures to achieve a theocratic regime has been scrutinized in this article. The Architecture of Gilead was given an intrusive wall of glass, where the symbol of eyes prevails, to externalize the surveillance of God on each one of its citizens, thereby forming a cultural memory of subjectivity. To make the citizens identify with groups, this theocratic regime specifies roles to citizens according to their rank for men and according to reproductive efficiency for women. Keeping in view the relevance of language in forming cultural memory, Atwood prescribed a set of greetings such as ‘under his eyes,’ and ‘praise be’ to make profound imprints on the individual memory of citizens, which has been discussed in the study. These three Memory Figures simultaneously form collective memory imprints on the citizens of Gilead, which in time became inherent cultural memories. This article explores how, by politicizing the issue of cultural memory in The Testaments, Atwood taps into the agency of people and establishes language control (communicative) to form the cultural memory narrative.

                Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It may be idiopathic or due to secondary causes. Among the secondary causes, heavy metals like mercury are the one among others. Here is a male with nil comorbidities who, upon exposure to mercury-containing skin cream, developed proteinuria, which, on evaluation, was found to have dual renal lesions like membranous nephropathy and chronic interstitial nephritis. The uniform PLA2R staining within the glomerular capillary walls shows the ability of mercury to induce inflammation and autoimmunity. This case strengthens the findings of in vitro studies about mercury-induced inflammatory processes.

                Introduction Comprehensive oral care is a service centered around the patient, and individuals who need it the most often face limited access. Patient perception acts as a guide for enhancing quality, ensuring patients’ future intent to utilize the services and facilitating recommendations to others. The present study aimed to assess the patients’ perception of comprehensive dental services availed at a Primary Health Center (PHC). Methods This qualitative study was based on a phenomenological interpretive approach, and judgment sampling method was employed. A validated interview guide, developed from relevant literature was employed in the local language to conduct interviews among adults visiting the PHC, gathering their views regarding the services provided. The interviews were audio recorded on a digital voice recorder, and files were password protected. Content saturation guided the determination of the final number of participants interviewed. After translating and transcribing the interviews, thematic analysis and coding were performed using ATLAS. ti 23 for Windows. Results A total of 12 participants were included in the study, following data saturation. Among them, there were 8(66.7%) female and 4(33.3%) male participants. Ten overarching main themes were discerned through the assigned codes, including positive views, neutral views, negative views, previous dental clinics visited, previous experience with dental treatment, treatments sought at the center, referrals, source of information about the dental center, subsequent visits and suggestions for improvement. Conclusions The findings of this study revealed a positive patient perception of the comprehensive dental services offered at the PHC. Through insightful interviews, various strengths, and areas for improvement regarding the center and care provision were identified. These insights provide valuable suggestions that can be applied to elevate the utilization of dental services, ensuring continuous improvement in patient care.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background Access to sample-level metadata is important when selecting public metagenomic sequencing datasets for reuse in new biological analyses. The Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics community (SPAAM, https://spaam-community.org) has previously published AncientMetagenomeDir, a collection of curated and standardised sample metadata tables for metagenomic and microbial genome datasets generated from ancient samples. However, while sample-level information is useful for identifying relevant samples for inclusion in new projects, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing metadata are also essential for appropriately reprocessing ancient metagenomic data. Currently, recovering information for downloading and preparing such data is difficult when laboratory and bioinformatic metadata is heterogeneously recorded in prose-based publications. Methods Through a series of community-based hackathon events, AncientMetagenomeDir was updated to provide standardised library-level metadata of existing and new ancient metagenomic samples. In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was developed to facilitate rapid data filtering and downloading of ancient metagenomic data, as well as improving automated metadata curation and validation for AncientMetagenomeDir. Results AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised metadata of over 6000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of data sharing by the community. Conclusions Together, both standardised metadata reporting and tooling will help towards easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic datasets into future analyses.

                <p>by Franz Wurm, Benjamin Ernst, Marco Steinhauser</p>

The structural credit assignment problem arises when the causal structure between actions and subsequent outcomes is hidden from direct observation. To solve this problem and enable goal-directed behavior, an agent has to infer structure and form a representation thereof. In the scope of this study, we investigate a possible solution in the human brain. We recorded behavioral and electrophysiological data from human participants in a novel variant of the bandit task, where multiple actions lead to multiple outcomes. Crucially, the mapping between actions and outcomes was hidden and not instructed to the participants. Human choice behavior revealed clear hallmarks of credit assignment and learning. Moreover, a computational model which formalizes action selection as the competition between multiple representations of the hidden structure was fit to account for participants data. Starting in a state of uncertainty about the correct representation, the central mechanism of this model is the arbitration of action control towards the representation which minimizes surprise about outcomes. Crucially, single-trial latent-variable analysis reveals that the neural patterns clearly support central quantitative predictions of this surprise minimization model. The results suggest that neural activity is not only related to reinforcement learning under correct as well as incorrect task representations but also reflects central mechanisms of credit assignment and behavioral arbitration.

                <p>by Lucy Lansch-Justen, Meriem El Karoui, Helen K. Alexander</p>

Exposure to environmental stressors, including certain antibiotics, induces stress responses in bacteria. Some of these responses increase mutagenesis and thus potentially accelerate resistance evolution. Many studies report increased mutation rates under stress, often using the standard experimental approach of fluctuation assays. However, single-cell studies have revealed that many stress responses are heterogeneously expressed in bacterial populations, which existing estimation methods have not yet addressed. We develop a population dynamic model that considers heterogeneous stress responses (subpopulations of cells with the response <i>off</i> or <i>on</i>) that impact both mutation rate and cell division rate, inspired by the DNA-damage response in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (SOS response). We derive the mutant count distribution arising in fluctuation assays under this model and then implement maximum likelihood estimation of the mutation-rate increase specifically associated with the expression of the stress response. Using simulated mutant count data, we show that our inference method allows for accurate and precise estimation of the mutation-rate increase, provided that this increase is sufficiently large and the induction of the response also reduces the division rate. Moreover, we find that in many cases, either heterogeneity in stress responses or mutant fitness costs could explain similar patterns in fluctuation assay data, suggesting that separate experiments would be required to identify the true underlying process. In cases where stress responses and mutation rates are heterogeneous, current methods still correctly infer the effective increase in population mean mutation rate, but we provide a novel method to infer distinct stress-induced mutation rates, which could be important for parameterising evolutionary models.

In ischaemic stroke, a large reduction in blood supply can lead to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and to cerebral oedema after reperfusion therapy. The resulting fluid accumulation in the brain may contribute to a significant rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) and tissue deformation. Changes in the level of ICP are essential for clinical decision-making and therapeutic strategies. However, the measurement of ICP is constrained by clinical techniques and obtaining the exact values of the ICP has proven challenging. In this study, we propose the first computational model for the simulation of cerebral oedema following acute ischaemic stroke for the investigation of ICP and midline shift (MLS) relationship. The model consists of three components for the simulation of healthy blood flow, occluded blood flow and oedema, respectively. The healthy and occluded blood flow components are utilized to obtain oedema core geometry and then imported into the oedema model for the simulation of oedema growth. The simulation results of the model are compared with clinical data from 97 traumatic brain injury patients for the validation of major model parameters. Midline shift has been widely used for the diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and prognosis of oedema patients. Therefore, we focus on quantifying the relationship between ICP and midline shift (MLS) and identify the factors that can affect the ICP-MLS relationship. Three major factors are investigated, including the brain geometry, blood-brain barrier damage severity and the types of oedema (including rare types of oedema). Meanwhile, the two major types (stress and tension/compression) of mechanical brain damage are also presented and the differences in the stress, tension, and compression between the intraparenchymal and periventricular regions are discussed. This work helps to predict ICP precisely and therefore provides improved clinical guidance for the treatment of brain oedema.

Considerable spatial heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 transmission across administrative areas of England throughout the pandemic. This study investigates what drives these differences. We constructed a probabilistic case count model for 306 administrative areas of England across 95 weeks, fit using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework. We incorporate the impact of acquired immunity, of spatial exportation of cases, and 16 spatially-varying socio-economic, socio-demographic, health, and mobility variables. Model comparison assesses the relative contributions of these respective mechanisms. We find that spatially-varying and time-varying differences in week-to-week transmission were definitively associated with differences in: time spent at home, variant-of-concern proportion, and adult social care funding. However, model comparison demonstrates that the impact of these terms is negligible compared to the role of spatial exportation between administrative areas. While these results confirm the impact of some, but not all, static measures of spatially-varying inequity in England, our work corroborates the finding that observed differences in disease transmission during the pandemic were predominantly driven by underlying epidemiological factors rather than aggregated metrics of demography and health inequity between areas. Further work is required to assess how health inequity more broadly contributes to these epidemiological factors.
