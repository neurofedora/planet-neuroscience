     alt="Effects of 4-month running exercise on the spatial learning ability and white matter volume and microvessels of middle-aged female and male rats"/>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of the effects of 4 months treadmill running on spatial learning ability, white matter volume and the microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged rats revealed actual benefits of exercise at the brain aging of middle-aged female and male rats. This report showed that there were sex differences in the protective effects of the 4-month exercise protocol on spatial learning and white matter volume. 4 months of exercise can protect the microvessels in the white matter of middle-aged rats.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related degeneration of microvessels is known to occur in white matter, and exercise training can enhance brain function and promote cerebral blood flow. However, the effects of exercise training on microvessels in aged white matter are unknown. Forty-one middle-aged male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sedentary group and an exercised group. The rats in the exercised group were made to run on treadmills for 4 months. The spatial learning capacities of all groups were then assessed with the Morris water maze. White matter and its microvessels were investigated using immunohistological techniques and stereological methods. In the exercised group, females but not males, showed improved performance over time in the Morris water maze. In females but not males, the exercised rats showed significantly increased white matter volume compared with that of sedentary rats. The total length of microvessels in the white matter in the exercised group was significantly increased compared with that in the sedentary group in both males and females, but the total volume and total surface area of microvessels in the white matter did not differ significantly between the sedentary and exercised rats. Regular treadmill exercise had protective effects on spatial learning capacity, white matter volume, and the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged female rats and on the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged male rats. The results obtained might increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise delays brain aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">EEG Signals Index a Global Signature of Arousal Embedded in Neuronal Population Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been used to index brain states, from early studies describing activity in the presence and absence of visual stimulation to modern work employing complex perceptual tasks. These studies have shed light on brain-wide signals but often lack explanatory power at the single neuron level. Similarly, single neuron recordings can suffer from an inability to measure brain-wide signals accessible using EEG. Here, we combined these techniques while monkeys performed a change detection task and discovered a novel link between spontaneous EEG activity and a neural signal embedded in the spiking responses of neuronal populations. This "slow drift" was associated with fluctuations in the subjects&rsquo; arousal levels over time: decreases in prestimulus &alpha; power were accompanied by increases in pupil size and decreases in microsaccade rate. These results show that brain-wide EEG signals can be used to index modes of activity present in single neuron recordings, that in turn reflect global changes in brain state that influence perception and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale and Extended Retrieval of Associative Memory Structures in a Cortical Model of Local-Global Inhibition Balance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Inhibitory neurons take on many forms and functions. How this diversity contributes to memory function is not completely known. Previous formal studies indicate inhibition differentiated by local and global connectivity in associative memory networks functions to rescale the level of retrieval of excitatory assemblies. However, such studies lack biological details such as a distinction between types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), unrealistic connection schemas, and nonsparse assemblies. In this study, we present a rate-based cortical model where neurons are distinguished (as excitatory, local inhibitory, or global inhibitory), connected more realistically, and where memory items correspond to sparse excitatory assemblies. We use this model to study how local-global inhibition balance can alter memory retrieval in associative memory structures, including naturalistic and artificial structures. Experimental studies have reported inhibitory neurons and their subtypes uniquely respond to specific stimuli and can form sophisticated, joint excitatory-inhibitory assemblies. Our model suggests such joint assemblies, as well as a distribution and rebalancing of overall inhibition between two inhibitory subpopulations, one connected to excitatory assemblies locally and the other connected globally, can quadruple the range of retrieval across related memories. We identify a possible functional role for local-global inhibitory balance to, in the context of choice or preference of relationships, permit and maintain a broader range of memory items when local inhibition is dominant and conversely consolidate and strengthen a smaller range of memory items when global inhibition is dominant. This model, while still theoretical, therefore highlights a potentially biologically-plausible and behaviorally-useful function of inhibitory diversity in memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Structural Analysis of Human and Mouse Dendritic Spines Reveals a Morphological Continuum and Differences across Ages and Species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendritic spines have diverse morphologies, with a wide range of head and neck sizes, and these morphologic differences likely generate different functional properties. To explore how this morphologic diversity differs across species and ages we analyzed 3D confocal reconstructions of ~8000 human spines and ~1700 mouse spines, labeled by intracellular injections in fixed tissue. Using unsupervised algorithms, we computationally separated spine heads and necks and systematically measured morphologic features of spines in apical and basal dendrites from cortical pyramidal cells. Human spines had unimodal distributions of parameters, without any evidence of morphologic subtypes. Their spine necks were longer and thinner in apical than in basal spines, and spine head volumes of an 85-year-old individual were larger than those of a 40-year-old individual. Human spines had longer and thicker necks and larger head volumes than mouse spines. Our results indicate that human spines form part of a continuum, are larger and longer than those of mice, and become larger with increasing adult age. These morphologic differences in spines across species could generate functional differences in biochemical and electrical spine compartmentalization, or in synaptic properties, across species and ages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Pathogenic Mutation of TDP-43 Impairs RNA Processing in a Cell Type-Specific Manner: Implications for the Pathogenesis of ALS/FTLD</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Transactivating response element DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), which is encoded by the <I>TARDBP</I> gene, is an RNA-binding protein with fundamental RNA processing activities, and its loss-of-function (LOF) has a central role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). <I>TARDBP</I> mutations are postulated to inactivate TDP-43 functions, leading to impaired RNA processing. However, it has not been fully examined how mutant TDP-43 affects global RNA regulation, especially in human cell models. Here, we examined global RNA processing in forebrain cortical neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a pathogenic <I>TARDBP</I> mutation encoding the TDP-43<sup>K263E</sup> protein. In neurons expressing mutant TDP-43, we detected disrupted RNA regulation, including global changes in gene expression, missplicing, and aberrant polyadenylation, all of which were highly similar to those induced by TDP-43 knock-down. This mutation-induced TDP-43 LOF was not because of the cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43. Intriguingly, in nonneuronal cells, including iPSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), we did not observe impairments in RNA processing, thus indicating that the K263E mutation results in neuron-specific LOF of TDP-43. This study characterizes global RNA processing impairments induced by mutant TDP-43 and reveals the unprecedented cell type specificity of TDP-43 LOF in ALS/FTLD pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus Modifies Blood Glucose Levels by Controlling Sympathetic Nervous Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) participates in glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscles. However, the glucoregulatory role of USP2 in the CNS is not well known. In this study, we focus on USP2 in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which has dominant control over systemic glucose homeostasis. ISH, using a <I>Usp2</I>-specific probe, showed that <I>Usp2</I> mRNA is present in VMH neurons, as well as other glucoregulatory nuclei, in the hypothalamus of male mice. Administration of a USP2-selective inhibitor ML364 (20 ng/head), into the VMH elicited a rapid increase in the circulating glucose level in male mice, suggesting USP2 has a suppressive role on glucose mobilization. ML364 treatment also increased serum norepinephrine concentration, whereas it negligibly affected serum levels of insulin and corticosterone. ML364 perturbated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in neural SH-SY5Y cells and subsequently promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Consistent with these findings, hypothalamic ML364 treatment stimulated AMPK&alpha; phosphorylation in the VMH. Inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK prevented ML364 from increasing serum norepinephrine and blood glucose. Removal of ROS restored the ML364-evoked mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells and impeded the ML364-induced hypothalamic AMPK&alpha; phosphorylation as well as prevented the elevation of serum norepinephrine and blood glucose levels in male mice. These results indicate hypothalamic USP2 attenuates perturbations in blood glucose levels by modifying the ROS&ndash;AMPK&ndash;sympathetic nerve axis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Under normal conditions (excluding hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia), blood glucose levels are maintained at a constant level. In this study, we used a mouse model to identify a hypothalamic protease controlling blood glucose levels. Pharmacological inhibition of USP2 in the VMH caused a deviation in blood glucose levels under a nonstressed condition, indicating that USP2 determines the set point of the blood glucose level. Modification of sympathetic nervous activity accounts for the USP2-mediated glucoregulation. Mechanistically, USP2 mitigates the accumulation of ROS in the VMH, resulting in attenuation of the phosphorylation of AMPK. Based on these findings, we uncovered a novel glucoregulatory axis consisting of hypothalamic USP2, ROS, AMPK, and the sympathetic nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Parametric Cognitive Load Reveals Hidden Costs in the Neural Processing of Perfectly Intelligible Degraded Speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>Speech is often degraded by environmental noise or hearing impairment. People can compensate for degradation, but this requires cognitive effort. Previous research has identified frontotemporal networks involved in effortful perception, but materials in these works were also less intelligible, and so it is not clear whether activity reflected effort or intelligibility differences. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which spoken sentences were processed under distraction and whether this depended on speech quality even when intelligibility of degraded speech was matched to that of clear speech (close to 100%). On each trial, male and female human participants either attended to a sentence or to a concurrent multiple object tracking (MOT) task that imposed parametric cognitive load. Activity in bilateral anterior insula reflected task demands; during the MOT task, activity increased as cognitive load increased, and during speech listening, activity increased as speech became more degraded. In marked contrast, activity in bilateral anterior temporal cortex was speech selective and gated by attention when speech was degraded. In this region, performance of the MOT task with a trivial load blocked processing of degraded speech, whereas processing of clear speech was unaffected. As load increased, responses to clear speech in these areas declined, consistent with reduced capacity to process it. This result dissociates cognitive control from speech processing; substantially less cognitive control is required to process clear speech than is required to understand even very mildly degraded, 100% intelligible speech. Perceptual and control systems clearly interact dynamically during real-world speech comprehension.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech is often perfectly intelligible even when degraded, for example, by background sound, phone transmission, or hearing loss. How does degradation alter cognitive demands? Here, we use fMRI to demonstrate a novel and critical role for cognitive control in the processing of mildly degraded but perfectly intelligible speech. We compare speech that is matched for intelligibility but differs in putative control demands, dissociating cognitive control from speech processing. We also impose a parametric cognitive load during perception, dissociating processes that depend on tasks from those that depend on available capacity. Our findings distinguish between frontal and temporal contributions to speech perception and reveal a hidden cost to processing mildly degraded speech, underscoring the importance of cognitive control for everyday speech comprehension.</p>

                <p>Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is the reduction in responses to frequent stimuli (standards) that does not generalize to rare stimuli (deviants). We investigated the contribution of inhibition in auditory cortex to SSA using two-photon targeted cell-attached recordings and optogenetic manipulations in male mice. We characterized the responses of parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SST)-, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons of layer 2/3, and of serotonin receptor 5HT3a-expressing interneurons of layer 1. All populations showed early-onset SSA. Unexpectedly, the PV, SST, and VIP populations exhibited a substantial late component of evoked activity, often stronger for standard than for deviant stimuli. Optogenetic suppression of PV neurons facilitated pyramidal neuron responses substantially more (approximately <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>10) for deviants than for standards. VIP suppression decreased responses of putative PV neurons, specifically for standard but not for deviant stimuli. Thus, the inhibitory network does not generate cortical SSA, but powerfully controls its expression by differentially affecting the responses to deviants and to standards.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) reflects the growing complexity of auditory processing along the ascending auditory system. In the presence of SSA, neuronal responses depend not only on the stimulus itself but also on the history of stimulation. Strong SSA in the fast, ascending auditory pathway first occurs in cortex. Here we studied the role of the cortical inhibitory network in shaping SSA, showing that while cortical inhibition does not generate SSA, it powerfully controls its expression. We deduce that the cortical network contributes in crucial ways to the properties of SSA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structural and Functional Network-Level Reorganization in the Coding of Auditory Motion Directions and Sound Source Locations in the Absence of Vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 is a region in the middle occipitotemporal cortex that responds preferentially to visual motion in sighted people. In cases of early visual deprivation, hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 enhances its response to moving sounds. Whether hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 contains information about motion directions and whether the functional enhancement observed in the blind is motion specific, or also involves sound source location, remains unsolved. Moreover, the impact of this cross-modal reorganization of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 on the regions typically supporting auditory motion processing, like the human planum temporale (hPT), remains equivocal. We used a combined functional and diffusion-weighted MRI approach and individual in-ear recordings to study the impact of early blindness on the brain networks supporting spatial hearing in male and female humans. Whole-brain univariate analysis revealed that the anterior portion of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 responded to moving sounds in sighted and blind people, while the posterior portion was selective to moving sounds only in blind participants. Multivariate decoding analysis revealed that the presence of motion direction and sound position information was higher in hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 and lower in hPT in the blind group. While both groups showed axis-of-motion organization in hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 and hPT, this organization was reduced in the hPT of blind people. Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed that the strength of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5&ndash;hPT connectivity did not differ between groups, whereas the microstructure of the connections was altered by blindness. Our results suggest that the axis-of-motion organization of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 does not depend on visual experience, but that congenital blindness alters the response properties of occipitotemporal networks supporting spatial hearing in the sighted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spatial hearing helps living organisms navigate their environment. This is certainly even more true in people born blind. How does blindness affect the brain network supporting auditory motion and sound source location? Our results show that the presence of motion direction and sound position information was higher in hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 and lower in human planum temporale in blind relative to sighted people; and that this functional reorganization is accompanied by microstructural (but not macrostructural) alterations in their connections. These findings suggest that blindness alters cross-modal responses between connected areas that share the same computational goals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Two Types of Auditory Spatial Receptive Fields in Different Parts of the Chicken's Midbrain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The optic tectum (OT) is an avian midbrain structure involved in the integration of visual and auditory stimuli. Studies in the barn owl, an auditory specialist, have shown that spatial auditory information is topographically represented in the OT. Little is known about how auditory space is represented in the midbrain of birds with generalist hearing, i.e., most of avian species lacking peripheral adaptations such as facial ruffs or asymmetric ears. Thus, we conducted <I>in vivo</I> extracellular recordings of single neurons in the OT and in the external portion of the formatio reticularis lateralis (FRLx), a brain structure located between the inferior colliculus (IC) and the OT, in anaesthetized chickens of either sex. We found that most of the auditory spatial receptive fields (aSRFs) were spatially confined both in azimuth and elevation, divided into two main classes: round aSRFs, mainly present in the OT, and annular aSRFs, with a ring-like shape around the interaural axis, mainly present in the FRLx. Our data further indicate that interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) play a role in the formation of both aSRF classes. These results suggest that, unlike mammals and owls which have a congruent representation of visual and auditory space in the OT, generalist birds separate the computation of auditory space in two different midbrain structures. We hypothesize that the FRLx-annular aSRFs define the distance of a sound source from the axis of the lateral visual fovea, whereas the OT-round aSRFs are involved in multimodal integration of the stimulus around the lateral fovea.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies implied that auditory spatial receptive fields (aSRFs) in the midbrain of generalist birds are only confined along azimuth. Interestingly, we found SRFs s in the chicken to be confined along both azimuth and elevation. Moreover, the auditory receptive fields are arranged in a concentric manner around the overlapping interaural and visual axes. These data suggest that in generalist birds, which mainly rely on vision, the auditory system mainly serves to align auditory stimuli with the visual axis, while auditory specialized birds like the barn owl compute sound sources more precisely and integrate sound positions in the multimodal space map of the optic tectum (OT).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conflict Detection in a Sequential Decision Task Is Associated with Increased Cortico-Subthalamic Coherence and Prolonged Subthalamic Oscillatory Response in the {beta} Band</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making accurate decisions often involves the integration of current and past evidence. Here, we examine the neural correlates of conflict and evidence integration during sequential decision-making. Female and male human patients implanted with deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls performed an expanded judgment task, in which they were free to choose how many cues to sample. Behaviorally, we found that while patients sampled numerically more cues, they were less able to integrate evidence and showed suboptimal performance. Using recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (LFPs; in patients) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), we found that &beta; oscillations signaled conflict between cues within a sequence. Following cues that differed from previous cues, &beta; power in the STN and cortex first decreased and then increased. Importantly, the conflict signal in the STN outlasted the cortical one, carrying over to the next cue in the sequence. Furthermore, after a conflict, there was an increase in coherence between the dorsal premotor cortex and STN in the &beta; band. These results extend our understanding of cortico-subcortical dynamics of conflict processing, and do so in a context where evidence must be accumulated in discrete steps, much like in real life. Thus, the present work leads to a more nuanced picture of conflict monitoring systems in the brain and potential changes because of disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decision-making often involves the integration of multiple pieces of information over time to make accurate predictions. We simultaneously recorded whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (LFPs) from the human subthalamic nucleus (STN) in a novel task which required integrating sequentially presented pieces of evidence. Our key finding is prolonged &beta; oscillations in the STN, with a concurrent increase in communication with frontal cortex, when presented with conflicting information. These neural effects reflect the behavioral profile of reduced tendency to respond after conflict, as well as relate to suboptimal cue integration in patients, which may be directly linked to clinically reported side-effects of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) such as impaired decision-making and impulsivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Dorsal Visual Pathway Represents Object-Centered Spatial Relations for Object Recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although there is mounting evidence that input from the dorsal visual pathway is crucial for object processes in the ventral pathway, the specific functional contributions of dorsal cortex to these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that dorsal cortex computes the spatial relations among an object's parts, a process crucial for forming global shape percepts, and transmits this information to the ventral pathway to support object categorization. Using fMRI with human participants (females and males), we discovered regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that were selectively involved in computing object-centered part relations. These regions exhibited task-dependent functional and effective connectivity with ventral cortex, and were distinct from other dorsal regions, such as those representing allocentric relations, 3D shape, and tools. In a subsequent experiment, we found that the multivariate response of posterior (p)IPS, defined on the basis of part-relations, could be used to decode object category at levels comparable to ventral object regions. Moreover, mediation and multivariate effective connectivity analyses further suggested that IPS may account for representations of part relations in the ventral pathway. Together, our results highlight specific contributions of the dorsal visual pathway to object recognition. We suggest that dorsal cortex is a crucial source of input to the ventral pathway and may support the ability to categorize objects on the basis of global shape.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans categorize novel objects rapidly and effortlessly. Such categorization is achieved by representing an object's global shape structure, that is, the relations among object parts. Yet, despite their importance, it is unclear how part relations are represented neurally. Here, we hypothesized that object-centered part relations may be computed by the dorsal visual pathway, which is typically implicated in visuospatial processing. Using fMRI, we identified regions selective for the part relations in dorsal cortex. We found that these regions can support object categorization, and even mediate representations of part relations in the ventral pathway, the region typically thought to support object categorization. Together, these findings shed light on the broader network of brain regions that support object categorization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sleep-Specific Processing of Auditory Stimuli Is Reflected by Alpha and Sigma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent research revealed a surprisingly large range of cognitive operations to be preserved during sleep in humans. The new challenge is therefore to understand functions and mechanisms of processes, which so far have been mainly investigated in awake subjects. The current study focuses on dynamic changes of brain oscillations and connectivity patterns in response to environmental stimulation during non-REM sleep. Our results indicate that aurally presented names were processed and neuronally differentiated across the wake-sleep spectrum. Simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG signals revealed two distinct clusters of oscillatory power increase in response to the stimuli: (1) vigilance state-independent  synchronization occurring immediately after stimulus onset, followed by (2) sleep-specific &alpha;/ synchronization peaking after stimulus offset. We discuss the possible role of , &alpha;, and  oscillations during non-REM sleep, and work toward a unified theory of brain rhythms and their functions during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has revealed (residual) capacity of the sleeping human brain to interact with the environment. How sensory processing is realized by the neural assemblies in different stages of sleep is however unclear. To tackle this question, we examined simultaneously recorded MEG and EEG data. We discuss the possible role of , &alpha;, and  oscillations during non-REM sleep. In contrast to versatile  band response that reflected early stimulus processing step, succeeding &alpha; and  band activity was sensitive to the saliency of the incoming information, and contingent on the sleep stage. Our findings suggest that the specific reorganization of mechanisms involved in later stages of sensory processing takes place upon falling asleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Voluntary Exercise Boosts Striatal Dopamine Release: Evidence for the Necessary and Sufficient Role of BDNF</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physical exercise improves motor performance in individuals with Parkinson's disease and elevates mood in those with depression. Although underlying factors have not been identified, clues arise from previous studies showing a link between cognitive benefits of exercise and increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we investigated the influence of voluntary wheel-running exercise on BDNF levels in the striatum of young male wild-type (WT) mice, and on the striatal release of a key motor-system transmitter, dopamine (DA). Mice were allowed unlimited access to a freely rotating wheel (runners) or a locked wheel (controls) for 30 d. Electrically evoked DA release was quantified in <I>ex vivo</I> corticostriatal slices from these animals using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. We found that exercise increased BDNF levels in dorsal striatum (dStr) and increased DA release in dStr and in nucleus accumbens core and shell. Increased DA release was independent of striatal acetylcholine (ACh), and persisted after a week of rest. We tested a role for BDNF in the influence of exercise on DA release using mice that were heterozygous for BDNF deletion (BDNF<sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). In contrast to WT mice, evoked DA release did not differ between BDNF<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> runners and controls. Complementary pharmacological studies using a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist in WT mouse slices showed that TrkB receptor activation also increased evoked DA release throughout striatum in an ACh-independent manner. Together, these data support a causal role for BDNF in exercise-enhanced striatal DA release and provide mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of exercise in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's, depression, and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Exercise has been shown to improve movement and cognition in humans and rodents. Here, we report that voluntary exercise for 30 d leads to an increase in evoked DA release throughout the striatum and an increase in BDNF in the dorsal (motor) striatum. The increase in DA release appears to require BDNF, indicated by the absence of DA release enhancement with running in BDNF<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice. Activation of BDNF receptors using a pharmacological agonist was also shown to boost DA release. Together, these data support a necessary and sufficient role for BDNF in exercise-enhanced DA release and provide mechanistic insight into the reported benefits of exercise in individuals with dopamine-linked neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease and depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Blocking Site-Specific Cleavage of Human Tau Delays Progression of Disease-Related Phenotypes in Genetically Matched Tau-Transgenic Mice Modeling Frontotemporal Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Studies have recently demonstrated that a caspase-2-mediated cleavage of human tau (htau) at asparate-314 (D314) is responsible for cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration in mice modeling frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, these animal studies may be confounded by flaws in their model systems, such as endogenous functional gene disruption and inequivalent transgene expression. To avoid these weaknesses, we examined the pathogenic role of this site-specific htau cleavage in FTD using genetically matched htau targeted-insertion mouse lines: rT2 and rT3. Both male and female mice were included in this study. rT2 mice contain a single copy of the FTD-linked htau proline-to-leucine mutation at amino acid 301 (htau P301L), inserted into a neutral site to avoid dysregulation of host gene expression. The similarly constructed rT3 mice harbor an additional D314-to-glutamate (D314E) mutation that blocks htau cleavage. We demonstrate that htau transgene expression occurs primarily in the forebrain at similar levels in rT2 and rT3 mice. Importantly, expression of the cleavage-resistant D314E mutant delays transgene-induced tau accumulation in the postsynaptic density, brain atrophy, hippocampal neurodegeneration, and spatial memory impairment, without altering age-related progression of pathologic tau conformation and phosphorylation. Our comprehensive investigation of age-dependent disease phenotypes associated with the htau P301L variant in precisely engineered FTD-modeling mice unveils a transiently protective effect of blocking htau cleavage at D314. Findings of this study advance our understanding of the contribution of this tau cleavage to the pathogenesis of FTD, and aid the development of effective dementia-targeting therapies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A site-specific and caspase-2-mediated cleavage of human tau plays a pathologic role in dementia. In this study, we investigate the contribution of this cleavage to the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using two genetically matched, tau-transgene targeted-insertion mouse lines that differ only by a cleavage-resistant mutation. The use of these mice avoids confounding effects associated with the random integration of tau transgenes to the mouse genome and allows us to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the tau cleavage on FTD phenotypes. Our data reveal that blocking this tau cleavage delays memory impairment and neurodegeneration of FTD-modeling mice. These findings improve our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying FTD and will facilitate the development of effective therapeutics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motor Impairments and Dopaminergic Defects Caused by Loss of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase Function in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the pathogenic mechanism underlying LRRK2 mutations remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the consequence of inactivation of LRRK2 and its functional homolog LRRK1 in male and female mice up to 25 months of age using behavioral, neurochemical, neuropathological, and ultrastructural analyses. We report that <I>LRRK1</I> and <I>LRRK2</I> double knock-out (<I>LRRK</I> DKO) mice exhibit impaired motor coordination at 12 months of age before the onset of dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SNpc). Moreover, <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice develop age-dependent, progressive loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Evoked dopamine (DA) release measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the dorsal striatum is also reduced in the absence of LRRK. Furthermore, <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice at 20&ndash;25 months of age show substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. The surviving SNpc neurons in <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice at 25 months of age accumulate large numbers of autophagic and autolysosomal vacuoles and are accompanied with microgliosis. Surprisingly, the cerebral cortex is unaffected, as shown by normal cortical volume and neuron number as well as unchanged number of apoptotic cells and microglia in <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice at 25 months. These findings show that loss of LRRK function causes impairments in motor coordination, degeneration of dopaminergic terminals, reduction of evoked DA release, and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, indicating that <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice are unique models for better understanding dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our current study employs a genetic approach to uncover the normal function of the LRRK family in the brain during mouse life span. Our multidisciplinary analysis demonstrates a critical normal physiological role of LRRK in maintaining the integrity and function of dopaminergic terminals and neurons in the aging brain, and show that <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice recapitulate several key features of PD and provide unique mouse models for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.</p>

                Background: With the implementation of lockdown and all students restricted to their houses, medical education has shifted towards the online mode. The objective of this study was to assess stress during the pandemic and the association between stress and involvement in online classes among students of a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka, South India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 324 undergraduate students at a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka, South India. The extent of stress was assessed using a perceived stress scale (PSS), and a questionnaire was used to identify different stressors and to understand the participant’s involvement in online classes. Results: In this study, the mean perceived stress score was 21.66 ± 4. Moderate stress was observed in 262 (85%) students. The main stressors noted were inability to focus (173 (56.4%)) and fear of exams (153 (49.8%)). A significant association was noted between stress and involvement in online classes. Conclusions: This study thereby highlights the need for more attention to the various stressors among students and for making online classes student friendly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction in Indonesia: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a form of acute coronary syndrome with high mortality rate. Management of STEMI should be performed as soon as possible to prevent further damage. With the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it may face obstacles. To overcome those problems, some changes in policy focusing on fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI patients have been applied. This study aimed to identify the effects of COVID-19 in management of STEMI patients in Indonesia. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH), the national referral center in Indonesia. We compared data between 2018 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021 as before and during COVID-19 pandemic period, respectively. We analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on STEMI patients' visits to hospital i.e., monthly hospital admission and symptoms-to-hospital, management of STEMI i.e., the strategies and time of reperfusion, and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients i.e., major adverse coronary event and mortality. Results: There was a significant statistically reduced mean of monthly hospital admissions from 11 to 7 (p = 0.002) and prolonged duration of symptoms-to-hospital during COVID-19 from 8 to 12 hours (p = 0.005). There was also a decrease in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) procedures during COVID-19 (65.2% vs. 27.8%, p<0.001), which was accompanied by an increased number of fibrinolytic (1.5% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001) and conservative therapy (28.5% vs. 55.6%, p <0.01). Moreover, there was also a prolonged duration of diagnosis-to-wire-crossing time (160 vs. 186 minutes, p = 0.005), meanwhile, percentage of urgent PCI, door-to-needle time, and clinical outcomes were not statistically significant. Conclusions: During COVID-19 pandemic, the number STEMI patients declined in monthly hospital admission, delays in symptoms-to-hospital time, changes in type of reperfusion strategy, and delays in PPCI procedures in CMH. Meanwhile, fibrinolytic time and clinical outcomes were not affected.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Outcomes in intervention research on snakebite envenomation: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: A core outcome set (COS) is a minimal list of consensus outcomes that should be used in all intervention research in a specific domain. COS enhance the ability to undertake meaningful comparisons and to understand the benefits or harms of different treatments. A first step in developing a COS is to identify outcomes that have been used previously. We did this global systematic review to provide the foundation for development of a region-specific COS for snakebite envenomation.  Methods: We searched 15 electronic databases, eight trial registries, and reference lists of included studies to identify reports of relevant trials, protocols, registry records and systematic reviews. We extracted verbatim data on outcomes, their definitions, measures, and time-points. Outcomes were classified as per an existing outcome taxonomy, and we identified unique outcomes based on similarities in the definition and measurement of the verbatim outcomes. Results: We included 107 records for 97 studies which met our inclusion criteria. These reported 538 outcomes, with a wide variety of outcome measures, definitions, and time points for measurement. We consolidated these into 88 unique outcomes, which we classified into core areas of mortality (1, 1.14 %), life impact (6, 6.82%), resource use (15, 17.05%), adverse events (7, 7.95%), physiological/clinical (51, 57.95%), and composite (8, 9.09%) outcomes. The types of outcomes varied by the type of intervention, and by geographic region. Only 15 of the 97 trials (17.04%) listed Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROMS). Conclusion: Trials evaluating interventions for snakebite demonstrate heterogeneity on outcomes and often omit important information related to outcome measurement (definitions, instruments, and time points). Developing high quality, region-specific COS for snakebite could inform the design of future trials and improve outcome reporting. Measurement of PROMS, resource use and life impact outcomes in trials on snakebite remains a gap.

                Background: Cytological samples are cleared with xylene in two or three baths during a Pap test, however, this solvent has a high degree of toxicity, and being a controlled reagent infers high costs for its purchase and implications for environmental pollution. We estimated the impact of xylene during the Pap test in terms of the number of liters and cost of two baths of xylene, and also estimated the impact with three baths  Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in four hospitals of EsSalud in Peru in two stages. First, the analysis of the impact due to the use of two baths of xylene was conducted during the period 2015–2019, and second, the estimates were calculated based on the assumption of three baths of xylene for the years 2020–2025. The assumption was based on the recommendations of the 2018 EsSalud cytology guideline. The monthly amount of xylene was ~10 liters per bath/month and the cost per liter was estimated at 8.13 USD (27 soles).  Results: For the staining of 594,898 cytology tests, 7,848 liters of xylene were necessary, resulting in a cost of 60,861 USD (202,068 soles) during the period 2015–2019. The estimates showed a maximum assumption of 9,483 liters and 77,110 USD (256,040 soles) for the use of three baths of xylene in the four EsSalud hospitals (p = 0.0025) during the period 2020–2025.   Conclusions: We determined that there was a high economic impact of using xylene with two baths from 2015 to 2019 and a dramatic increase in costs with the possible use of three baths of xylene in the Pap test for the following five years.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of invasive histological and molecular methods in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori from gastric biopsies of Sudanese patients: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The continuous rise in the number of patients suffering from Helicobacter pylori is probably due to the changes in modern life. Nowadays, patients suffering from gastrointestinal problems are diagnosed through invasive and non-invasive techniques. The choice of a diagnostic test is influenced by factors such as the tests' sensitivity and specificity, the clinical conditions, and the cost-effectiveness of the testing strategy. This study aimed to compare molecular detection methods of H. pylori by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S rRNA, ureA and glmM genes with an invasive histopathological technique. Methods: 290 gastric biopsies were collected using gastrointestinal endoscopy from patients with gastritis symptoms in different hospitals in Khartoum state. Two gastric biopsies were collected from each patient for PCR and histopathology. Results: A total of 103 (35.5%) samples were positive by histopathological examination, 88 (30.3%) by 16S rRNA, 39 (13.4%) by glmM gene, and 56 (19.3%) by ureA gene. The highest sensitivity was observed in 16S rRNA (46.6%), followed by glmM (24.3%) and ureA (23.3%). While the best specificity was observed in glmM gene (92.5%), followed by ureA (82.3%) and 16S rRNA (78.6%). Conclusion: PCR test targeting the 16S rRNA gene exhibited the best results for molecular detection of H. pylori compared to other genes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Individual-based model highlights the importance of trade-offs for virus-host population dynamics and long-term co-existence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fateme Pourhasanzade, Swami Iyer, Jesslyn Tjendra, Lotta Landor, Selina Våge</p>

Viruses play diverse and important roles in ecosystems. In recent years, trade-offs between host and virus traits have gained increasing attention in viral ecology and evolution. However, microbial organism traits, and viral population parameters in particular, are challenging to monitor. Mathematical and individual-based models are useful tools for predicting virus-host dynamics. We have developed an individual-based evolutionary model to study ecological interactions and evolution between bacteria and viruses, with emphasis on the impacts of trade-offs between competitive and defensive host traits on bacteria-phage population dynamics and trait diversification. Host dynamics are validated with lab results for different initial virus to host ratios (VHR). We show that trade-off based, as opposed to random bacteria-virus interactions, result in biologically plausible evolutionary outcomes, thus highlighting the importance of trade-offs in shaping biodiversity. The effects of nutrient concentration and other environmental and organismal parameters on the virus-host dynamics are also investigated. Despite its simplicity, our model serves as a powerful tool to study bacteria-phage interactions and mechanisms for evolutionary diversification under various environmental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cargo surface fluidity can reduce inter-motor mechanical interference, promote load-sharing and enhance processivity in teams of molecular motors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Niranjan Sarpangala, Ajay Gopinathan</p>

In cells, multiple molecular motors work together as teams to carry cargoes such as vesicles and organelles over long distances to their destinations by stepping along a network of cytoskeletal filaments. How motors that typically mechanically interfere with each other, work together as teams is unclear. Here we explored the possibility that purely physical mechanisms, such as cargo surface fluidity, may potentially enhance teamwork, both at the single motor and cargo level. To explore these mechanisms, we developed a three dimensional simulation of cargo transport along microtubules by teams of kinesin-1 motors. We accounted for cargo membrane fluidity by explicitly simulating the Brownian dynamics of motors on the cargo surface and considered both the load and ATP dependence of single motor functioning. Our simulations show that surface fluidity could lead to the reduction of negative mechanical interference between kinesins and enhanced load sharing thereby increasing the average duration of single motors on the filament. This, along with a cooperative increase in on-rates as more motors bind leads to enhanced collective processivity. At the cargo level, surface fluidity makes more motors available for binding, which can act synergistically with the above effects to further increase transport distances though this effect is significant only at low ATP or high motor density. Additionally, the fluid surface allows for the clustering of motors at a well defined location on the surface relative to the microtubule and the fluid-coupled motors can exert more collective force per motor against loads. Our work on understanding how teamwork arises in cargo-coupled motors allows us to connect single motor properties to overall transport, sheds new light on cellular processes, reconciles existing observations, encourages new experimental validation efforts and can also suggest new ways of improving the transport of artificial cargo powered by motor teams.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Annotation-free delineation of prokaryotic homology groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yongze Yin, Huw A. Ogilvie, Luay Nakhleh</p>

Phylogenomic studies of prokaryotic taxa often assume conserved marker genes are homologous across their length. However, processes such as horizontal gene transfer or gene duplication and loss may disrupt this homology by recombining only parts of genes, causing gene fission or fusion. We show using simulation that it is necessary to delineate homology groups in a set of bacterial genomes without relying on gene annotations to define the boundaries of homologous regions. To solve this problem, we have developed a graph-based algorithm to partition a set of bacterial genomes into Maximal Homologous Groups of sequences (MHGs) where each MHG is a maximal set of maximum-length sequences which are homologous across the entire sequence alignment. We applied our algorithm to a dataset of 19 Enterobacteriaceae species and found that MHGs cover much greater proportions of genomes than markers and, relatedly, are less biased in terms of the functions of the genes they cover. We zoomed in on the correlation between each individual marker and their overlapping MHGs, and show that few phylogenetic splits supported by the markers are supported by the MHGs while many marker-supported splits are contradicted by the MHGs. A comparison of the species tree inferred from marker genes with the species tree inferred from MHGs suggests that the increased bias and lack of genome coverage by markers causes incorrect inferences as to the overall relationship between bacterial taxa.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-dependent visualization of biological networks in the web-browser with NDExEdit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Florian Auer, Simone Mayer, Frank Kramer</p>

Networks are a common methodology used to capture increasingly complex associations between biological entities. They serve as a resource of biological knowledge for bioinformatics analyses, and also comprise the subsequent results. However, the interpretation of biological networks is challenging and requires suitable visualizations dependent on the contained information. The most prominent software in the field for the visualization of biological networks is Cytoscape, a desktop modeling environment also including many features for analysis.
A further challenge when working with networks is their distribution. Within a typical collaborative workflow, even slight changes of the network data force one to repeat the visualization step as well. Also, just minor adjustments to the visual representation not only need the networks to be transferred back and forth. Collaboration on the same resources requires specific infrastructure to avoid redundancies, or worse, the corruption of the data. A well-established solution is provided by the NDEx platform where users can upload a network, share it with selected colleagues or make it publicly available.
NDExEdit is a web-based application where simple changes can be made to biological networks within the browser, and which does not require installation. With our tool, plain networks can be enhanced easily for further usage in presentations and publications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An approximate stochastic optimal control framework to simulate nonlinear neuro-musculoskeletal models in the presence of noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tom Van Wouwe, Lena H. Ting, Friedl De Groote</p>

Optimal control simulations have shown that both musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise are important determinants of movement. However, due to the limited efficiency of available computational tools, deterministic simulations of movement focus on accurately modelling the musculoskeletal system while neglecting physiological noise, and stochastic simulations account for noise while simplifying the dynamics. We took advantage of recent approaches where stochastic optimal control problems are approximated using deterministic optimal control problems, which can be solved efficiently using direct collocation. We were thus able to extend predictions of stochastic optimal control as a theory of motor coordination to include muscle coordination and movement patterns emerging from non-linear musculoskeletal dynamics. In stochastic optimal control simulations of human standing balance, we demonstrated that the inclusion of muscle dynamics can predict muscle co-contraction as minimal effort strategy that complements sensorimotor feedback control in the presence of sensory noise. In simulations of reaching, we demonstrated that nonlinear multi-segment musculoskeletal dynamics enables complex perturbed and unperturbed reach trajectories under a variety of task conditions to be predicted. In both behaviors, we demonstrated how interactions between task constraint, sensory noise, and the intrinsic properties of muscle influence optimal muscle coordination patterns, including muscle co-contraction, and the resulting movement trajectories. Our approach enables a true minimum effort solution to be identified as task constraints, such as movement accuracy, can be explicitly imposed, rather than being approximated using penalty terms in the cost function. Our approximate stochastic optimal control framework predicts complex features, not captured by previous simulation approaches, providing a generalizable and valuable tool to study how musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise may alter neural control of movement in both healthy and pathological movements.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of anisometropia in children and adolescents [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This research was developed to study the epidemiology of anisometropia. It aims to estimate the prevalence of anisometropia in Portuguese children and adolescents at various educational stages, studying its association with sociodemographic variables. Methods: Observational cross sectional study envolving 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) from the central region of Portugal. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field auto refractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegia and under binocular conditions, to determine the rate of anisometropia and its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Results: The prevalence of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most prevalent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical differences were found between genders or between areas of residence regarding the rate of anisometropia. Regarding spherical equivalent anisometropia, there was a pattern of variation that increased with the cycle of studies (p = 0.012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: This study found an increase in anisometropia with the educational stage. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition beyond childhood.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">All neurons can perform linearly non-separable computations [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Multiple studies have shown how dendrites enable some neurons to perform linearly non-separable computations. These works focus on cells with an extended dendritic arbor where voltage can vary independently, turning dendritic branches into local non-linear subunits. However, these studies leave a large fraction of the nervous system unexplored. Many neurons, e.g. granule cells, have modest dendritic trees and are electrically compact. It is impossible to decompose them into multiple independent subunits. Here, we upgraded the integrate and fire neuron to account for saturation due to interacting synapses. This artificial neuron has a unique membrane voltage and can be seen as a single layer. We present a class of linearly non-separable computations and how our neuron can perform them. We thus demonstrate that even a single layer neuron with interacting synapses has more computational capacity than without. Because all neurons have one or more layer, we show that all neurons can potentially implement linearly non-separable computations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Noise intensity and its impact on the perception and concentration level among forest harvesting workers in industrial forest plantation, North Sumatera, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Noise has the potential to affect the comfort and health of workers. The objective of this research was to find out the effect of noise caused by the timber harvesting process using chainsaws on the concentration of workers in an industrial forest plantation. Methods: This experimental study included 20 respondents which consisted of 10 chainsaw operators/helpers and 10 non-chainsaw operators. All respondents were exposed to the sound of a chainsaw in three different conditions (idle, half gas and racing conditions) with and without personal protective equipment (PPE). The sound intensity produced by the chainsaw and the noise received by the respondents were measured using a sound level meter. Respondents’ perception toward noise was recorded using a Likert scale. Respondents’ concentration level was assessed by giving 25 math-questions to be answered within 10 minutes. Wilcoxon sign rank test was used to analysed paired data. Results: The average sound intensity received by respondents’ left and right ears were lower than the average sound intensity produced by the chainsaw. The use of earmuffs leads to better perception towards noise when compared with the use of earplugs and the absence of any PPE. The Wilcoxon test result showed that noise did not have significant impact on the concentration level of chainsaw operators, whilst the contrary result is true for non-chainsaw operators. Conclusions: The research indicated that although the noise produced by the chainsaw machine was considered noisy for both chainsaw operators and non-chainsaw operator, it did not have a significant effect on the concentration level of chainsaw operators and only affected the non-chainsaw operators. Therefore, given that the non-chainsaw operators were still affected by the noise, noise control measures are still needed to ensure occupational safety and health for the workers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Grammatical awareness and language performance: examining gendered differences among Saudi EFL (English as a foreign language) learners [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite the many studies that have been conducted on the learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) regarding grammar ability in various contexts, some gaps are still unbridged and need researching. Therefore, this study addresses the research gap in the Saudi context concerning the grammatical competence of Saudi EFL (English as foreign language) learners. Methods: This study described the Saudi EFL learners’ level of awareness in developing grammatical forms. It also assessed Saudi EFL students' level of performance in grammar learning. Finally, it quantitatively explored what, if any, gendered differences exist in the grammar acquisition of Saudi EFL learners. The study employed descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the data. The study sample comprised 50 Saudi EFL students out of the population of 120 students enrolled in EFL programs at Qassim University, Saudi Arabia with sample size being determined using online sampling calculator Raosoft. Results: The results of the present study show that the Saudi EFL learners manifest a favorable level of awareness in developing grammatical forms while they still not having attained mastery of English grammar. Results also indicate that grammatical competence and level of awareness are more advanced among the Saudi EFL female learners compared to their male counterparts. Conclusions: The outcomes of this research imply that Saudi EFL learners have sufficient performance in grammar learning but need further nurturance. Implications of this study will serve as a basis for English language learning development interventions in the benefit of the students.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, discovery-replication-validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 discovery cohort PD individuals and 83 replication cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associated with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which patients with PD showed fast (&gt; = 1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) versus slow (&lt; 1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the discovery cohort, testing it in the replication cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top 3 proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a validation cohort of 118 individuals with PD. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization (MR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only 3 proteins (melanoma inhibitory activity protein [MIA], C-reactive protein [CRP], and albumin) separated fast versus slow cognitive decline subgroups with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the validation cohort. The individuals with PD in the validation cohort in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at MIA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily obtained plasma-based predictor identifies individuals with PD at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Squamation and scale morphology at the root of jawed vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                Placoderms, as the earliest branching jawed vertebrates, are crucial to understanding how the characters of crown gnathostomes comprising Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes evolved from their stem relatives. Despite the growing knowledge of the anatomy and diversity of placoderms over the past decade, the dermal scales of placoderms are predominantly known from isolated material, either morphologically or histologically, resulting in their squamation being poorly understood. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the squamation and scale morphology of a primitive taxon of Antiarcha (a clade at the root of jawed vertebrates), <i>Parayunnanolepis xitunensis</i>, based on the virtual restoration of an articulated specimen by using X-ray computed tomography. Thirteen morphotypes of scales are classified to exhibit how the morphology changes with their position on the body in primitive antiarchs, based on which nine areas of the post-thoracic body are distinguished to show their scale variations in the dorsal, flank, ventral, and caudal lobe regions. In this study, the histological structure of yunnanolepidoid scales is described for the first time based on disarticulated scales from the type locality and horizon of <i>P. xitunensis</i>. The results demonstrate that yunnanolepidoid scales are remarkably different from their dermal plates as well as euantiarch scales in lack of a well-developed middle layer. Together, our study reveals that the high regionalization of squamation and the bipartite histological structure of scales might be plesiomorphic for antiarchs, and jawed vertebrates in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sparse genetically-defined neurons refine the canonical role of periaqueductal gray columnar organization</a></h4>

              
                During encounters with external threats, survival depends on the engagement of appropriate defensive reactions to minimize harm. There are major clinical implications for identifying the neural circuitry and activation patterns that produce such defensive reactions, as maladaptive overactivation of these circuits underlies pathological human anxiety and fear responses. A compelling body of work has linked activation of large glutamatergic neuronal populations in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) to defensive reactions such as freezing, flight and threat-induced analgesia. These pioneering data have firmly established that the overarching functional organization axis of the PAG is along anatomically-defined columnar boundaries. Accordingly, broad activation of the dorsolateral column induces flight, while activation of the lateral or ventrolateral (l and vl) columns induces freezing. However, the PAG contains a diverse arrangement of cell types that vary in neurochemical profile and location. How these cell types contribute to defensive responses remains largely unknown, indicating that targeting sparse, genetically-defined populations can lead to a deeper understanding of how the PAG generates a wide array of behaviors. Though several prior works showed that broad excitation of the lPAG or vlPAG causes freezing, we found in mice that activation of lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK) cells selectively caused flight to safer regions within an environment. Furthermore, inhibition of l/vlPAG-CCK cells reduced avoidance of a predatory threat without altering other defensive behaviors like freezing. Lastly, l/vlPAG-CCK activity decreased when approaching threat and increased during movement to safer locations. Taken together, these data suggest CCK cells are driving threat avoidance states, which are epochs during which mice increase distance from threat and perform evasive escape. In contrast, activating l/vlPAG cells pan-neuronally promoted freezing and these cells were activated near threat. These data underscore the importance of investigating genetically-identified PAG cells. Using this approach, we found a sparse population of CCK-expressing l/vlPAG cells that have distinct and opposing function and neural activation motifs compared to the broader local ensemble defined solely by columnar anatomical boundaries. Thus, in addition to the anatomical columnar architecture of the PAG, the molecular identity of PAG cells may confer an additional axis of functional organization, revealing unexplored functional heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Towards a molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial protein import through the TOM and TIM23 complexes</a></h4>

              
                Nearly all mitochondrial proteins need to be targeted for import from the cytosol. For the majority, the first port of call is the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex), followed by a procession of alternative molecular machines, conducting transport to their final destination. The pre-sequence translocase of the inner-membrane (TIM23-complex) imports proteins with cleavable pre-sequences. Progress in understanding these transport mechanisms has been hampered by the poor sensitivity and time-resolution of import assays. However, with the development of an assay based on split NanoLuc luciferase, we can now explore this process in greater detail. Here, we apply this new methodology to understand how ∆ψ and ATP hydrolysis, the two main driving forces for import into the matrix, contribute to the transport of pre-sequence-containing precursors (PCPs) with varying properties. Notably, we found that two major rate-limiting steps define PCP import time: passage of PCP across the outer membrane and initiation of inner membrane transport by the pre-sequence - the rates of which are influenced by PCP properties such as size and net charge. The apparent distinction between transport through the two membranes (passage through TOM is substantially complete before PCP-TIM engagement) is in contrast with the current view that import occurs through TOM and TIM in a single continuous step. Our results also indicate that PCPs spend very little time in the TIM23 channel – presumably rapid success or failure of import is critical for maintaining mitochondrial fitness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alone, in the dark: The extraordinary neuroethology of the solitary blind mole rat</a></h4>

              
                On the social scale, the blind mole rat (BMR; <i>Spalax ehrenbergi</i>) is an extreme. It is exceedingly solitary, territorial, and aggressive. BMRs reside underground, in self-excavated tunnels that they rarely leave. They possess specialized sensory systems for social communication and navigation, which allow them to cope with the harsh environmental conditions underground. This review aims to present the blind mole rat as an ideal, novel neuroethological model for studying aggressive and solitary behaviors. We discuss the BMR’s unique behavioral phenotype, particularly in the context of ‘anti-social’ behaviors, and review the available literature regarding its specialized sensory adaptations to the social and physical habitat. To date, the neurobiology of the blind mole rat remains mostly unknown and holds a promising avenue for scientific discovery. Unraveling the neural basis of the BMR’s behavior, in comparison to that of social rodents, can shed important light on the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders in humans, in which similar behaviors are displayed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">METTL18-mediated histidine methylation of RPL3 modulates translation elongation for proteostasis maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Protein methylation occurs predominantly on lysine and arginine residues, but histidine also serves as a methylation substrate. However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification have been reported. Moreover, the biological role of histidine methylation has remained poorly understood to date. Here, we report that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for the ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traversal on Tyr codons, allowing the proper folding of synthesized proteins. By performing an in vitro methylation assay with a methyl donor analog and quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at the τ-<i>N</i> position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed stoichiometric modification and suggested a role in translation reactions. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling and an in vitro translation assay revealed that translation elongation at Tyr codons was suppressed by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from the cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of a ribosome modification that ensures proteome integrity in cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological indices of individual differences in adult language learning</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in second language (L2) learning can offer insights into the neurobiological bases of learning aptitude. One neurophysiological marker of inter-individual differences in cognition is the individual alpha frequency (IAF), a trait-like measure correlated with cognition. Further, the N400 is an electrophysiological marker indexing stimulus irregularity and has been used to study L2 learning; however, its relationship with IAF and L2 learning remains unknown. To examine the relation between IAF and L2 learning (indexed by N400 amplitude), we report data from a modified miniature language learning study. After a vocabulary learning period, participants (N = 38, Mage = 25.3, SD = 7.13) judged the grammaticality of classifier-noun pairs, with mixed-effects modelling revealing lower IAF individuals were better than higher IAF individuals at grammaticality judgements. N400 amplitude also reduced across the experiment in low relative to high IAF individuals, indicating the relationship between IAF and language learning is more complex than initially postulated.

                Precisely timed behaviour and accurate time perception plays a critical role in our everyday lives, as our well-being and even survival can depend on well-timed decisions. Although the temporal structure of the world around us is essential for human decision making, we know surprisingly little about how representation of temporal structure of our everyday environment impacts decision making. How does the representation of temporal structure affect our ability to generate well-timed decisions? Here we address this question by using a well-established dynamic probabilistic learning task. Using computational modelling, we found that human subjects' beliefs about temporal structure are reflected in their choices to either exploit their current knowledge or to explore novel options. The model-based analysis illustrates a large within-group and within-subject heterogeneity. To explain these results, we propose a normative model for how temporal structure is used in decision making, based on the semi-Markov formalism in an active inference framework. We discuss potential key applications of the presented approach to the fields of cognitive phenotyping and computational psychiatry.

                Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a collection of rare disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures. Most DA mutations are in muscle- and joint-related genes, and the anatomical defects originate cell-autonomously within the musculoskeletal system. However, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO2, a principal mechanosensor in somatosensation, cause DA subtype 5 via unknown mechanisms. We show that expression of a GOF PIEZO2 mutation in proprioceptive sensory neurons mainly innervating muscle spindles and tendons is sufficient to induce DA5-like phenotypes in mice. Overactive PIEZO2 causes anatomical defects via increased activity within the peripheral nervous system during postnatal development. Remarkably, Botox and a dietary fatty acid that modulates PIEZO2 activity markedly reduce DA5-like deficits. This reveals an unexpected role for somatosensory neurons: excessive mechanosensation within these neurons disrupts musculoskeletal development.

                COVID-19 pandemic affected the global population in an unprecedented scale, with long-term consequences of SARS CoV-2 infection now emerging as a serious concern. Cognitive dysfunction is often reported in post-COVID patients, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we demonstrated that brain exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein through its infusion into the lateral ventricle of adult mice induced late cognitive impairment, hippocampal synapse loss, and microglial engulfment of presynaptic terminals. Additionally, TLR4 blockage prevented Sassociated detrimental effects on memory in mice and TLR4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10759931 was associated with late cognitive outcome in mild COVID-19-recovered patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that S protein directly impacts the brain and identify TLR4 as a key target to prevent cognitive dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model that recapitulates postCOVID cognitive impairment, opening new avenues for developing new strategies to prevent or treat the neurological outcomes of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binocular Imaging with The Conformal Eyes</a></h4>

              
                The human eye possesses a natural asymmetry of its optical components and an inhomogeneous distribution of photoreceptors causing optical aberrations and providing high acuity only at a 2-degree visual angle. Although these features greatly impact the visual system functions, they have not been supported by the geometric formulation of the fundamental binocular concepts. The author recently constructed a geometric theory of the binocular system with asymmetric eyes (AEs) integrated with the eyes' movement to address these problems. This theory suggests that a symmetric framework can fully represent the asymmetric properties of this binocular system with the AEs. Pursuing this idea leads to the conformal eye model furnished by the Riemann sphere. The conformal geometry of the Riemann sphere establishes efficient image representation in terms of the projective Fourier transform (PFT)---the Fourier transform on the group of image projective transformations representing images covariantly to these transformations. The PFT is fast computable by an FFT algorithm in log-polar coordinates known to approximate the retina-cortical mapping of the human brain's visual pathways. The retinotopy modeling here with PFT is compared to Schwartz's modeling with the exponential chirp transform showing clear advantages of PFT in both physiological conformity and numerical efficacy. Finally, the conformal eye model is extended to the AE, which can be implemented into the binocular system with AEs making PFT available for image processing. The PFT combined with the conformal eye model allows binocular extensions of the previous monocular algorithms for modeling visual stability during the saccade and smooth pursuit eye movements needed to offset the eye's acuity limitation.

                We report on the implementation and features of the Brain/MINDS Marmoset Connectivity Atlas, BMCA, a new resource that provides access to anterograde neuronal tracer data in the prefrontal cortex of a marmoset brain. Neuronal tracers combined with fluorescence microscopy are a key technology for the systematic mapping of structural brain connectivity. We selected the prefrontal cortex for mapping due to its important role in higher brain functions. This work introduces the BMCA standard image preprocessing pipeline and tools for exploring and reviewing the data. We developed the BMCA-Explorer, which is an online image viewer designed for data exploration. Unlike other existing image explorers, it visualizes the data of different individuals in a common reference space at an unprecedented high resolution, facilitating comparative studies. To foster the integration with other marmoset brain image databases and cross-species comparisons, we added fiber tractography data from diffusion MRI, retrograde neural tracer data from the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas project, and tools to map image data between marmoset and the human brain image space. This version of BMCA allows direct comparison between the results of 52 anterograde and 164 retrograde tracer injections in the cortex of the marmoset.

                High salt (HS) intake is a known risk factor for hypertension and dementia. Clinical studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs can decrease the incidence of dementia. Accordingly, a strong relationship can be suggested between hypertension and cognitive impairment. It is well-known that angiotensin II (Ang II)-AT1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-EP1 systems are involved in hypertension and neurotoxicity. However, the involvement of these systems in HS-mediated hypertension and emotional and cognitive impairments remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that hypertension and impaired social behavior and object recognition memory following HS intake could be associated with tau hyperphosphorylation, decreased phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice. These changes were blocked by pharmacological treatment with losartan, an Ang II receptor blocker (ARB), or EP1 gene knockout. Our findings suggest that Ang II-AT1 and PGE2-EP1 systems could be novel therapeutic targets for hypertension-induced dementia.

                The human brain is distinct from those of other species in terms of size, organization, and connectivity. How do these structural evolutionary differences drive patterns of neural activity enabling brain function? Here, we combine brain imaging and biophysical modeling to show that the anatomical wiring of the human brain distinctly shapes neural dynamics. This shaping is characterized by a narrower distribution of dynamic ranges across brain regions compared with that of chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives. We find that such a sharp dynamic range distribution supports faster integration between regions, particularly in transmodal systems. Conversely, a broad dynamic range distribution as seen in chimpanzees facilitates brain processes relying more on neural interactions within specialized local brain systems. These findings suggest that human brain dynamics have evolved to foster rapid associative processes in service of complex cognitive functions and behavior.

	<p>Background: Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine improves neurological function. Whether dexmedetomidine reduces mortality or improves quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) among patients post-craniotomy remains unclear. Methods: This single-center randomized study was conducted prospectively from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Patients who were transferred to the ICU after craniotomy within 24 h were included. The analgesic was titrated to a Critical care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) score &amp;amp;le;2, and the sedative was titrated to a Richmond Agitation&amp;amp;ndash;Sedation Scale (RASS) score &amp;amp;le;&amp;amp;minus;3 for at least 24 h. The qEEG signals were collected by four electrodes (F3, T3, F4, and T4 according to the international 10/20 EEG electrode practice). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and qEEG results on day 1 and day 3 after sedation. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 77 were in the dexmedetomidine group and 74 in the midazolam group. No significant difference was found between the two groups in mortality at 28 days (14.3% vs. 24.3%; p = 0.117) as well as in the theta/beta ratio (TBR), the delta/alpha ratio (DAR), and the (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (DTABR) between the two groups on day 1 or day 3. However, both the TBR and the DTABR were significantly increased in the dexmedetomidine group. The DTABR in the midazolam group was significantly increased. The DAR was significantly increased on the right side in the dexmedetomidine group (20.4 (11.6&amp;amp;ndash;43.3) vs. 35.1 (16.7&amp;amp;ndash;65.0), p = 0.006) as well as on both sides in the midazolam group (Left: 19.5 (10.1&amp;amp;ndash;35.8) vs. 37.3 (19.3&amp;amp;ndash;75.7), p = 0.006; Right: 18.9 (10.1&amp;amp;ndash;52.3) vs. 39.8 (17.5&amp;amp;ndash;99.9), p = 0.002). Conclusion: Compared with midazolam, dexmedetomidine did not lead to a lower 28-day mortality or better qEEG results in brain injury patients after a craniotomy.</p>

	<p>Background: Multi-modal neuroimaging with appropriate atlas is vital for effectively differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls (HC). Methods: The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) of 69 MCI patients and 61 HC subjects were collected. Then, the gray matter volumes obtained from the sMRI and Hurst exponent (HE) values calculated from rs-fMRI data in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL-90), Brainnetome (BN-246), Harvard&amp;amp;ndash;Oxford (HOA-112) and AAL3-170 atlases were extracted, respectively. Next, these characteristics were selected with a minimal redundancy maximal relevance algorithm and a sequential feature collection method in single or multi-modalities, and only the optimal features were retained after this procedure. Lastly, the retained characteristics were served as the input features for the support vector machine (SVM)-based method to classify MCI patients, and the performance was estimated with a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results: Our proposed method obtained the best 92.00% accuracy, 94.92% specificity and 89.39% sensitivity with the sMRI in AAL-90 and the fMRI in HOA-112 atlas, which was much better than using the single-modal or single-atlas features. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the multi-modal and multi-atlas integrated method could effectively recognize MCI patients, which could be extended into various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.</p>

	<p>Objectives: our group explored the correlation between postoperative coordinates of the electrode contacts, VTA, and anxiety and depression symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). Methods: STN-DBS was conducted on PD patients (n = 57) for six months with follow-up. Clinical outcomes were explored using the unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease rating scale Part III (UPDRS-III), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) before and after surgery. At the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), the location of active contacts and the volume of tissue activated (VTA) were calculated. Results: patient evaluations took place preoperatively and follow-ups took place at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The average patient improvement rates for HAM-A and HAM-D scores at the 6-month follow-up were 41.7% [interquartile range (IQR) 34.9%] and 37.5% (IQR 33.4%), respectively (both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In medication-off, there were negative correlations between the HAM-A improvement rate and the Z-axis coordinate of the active contact (left side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.308, p = 0.020; right side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.390, p = 0.003), and negative correlations between the HAM-D improvement rate and the Z-axis coordinate of the active contact (left side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.345, p = 0.009; right side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.521, p = 0.001). There were positive correlations between the HAM-A and HAM-D scores improvement rate at 6 months after surgery and bilateral VTA in the right STN limbic subregion (HAM-A: r = 0.314, p = 0.018; HAM-D: r = 0.321, p = 0.015). Conclusion: bilateral STN-DBS can improve anxiety and depression symptoms in PD patients. The closer the stimulation to the ventral limbic region of the STN, the more significant the improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms of PD patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Sensorimotor difficulties significantly interfere with daily activities, and when undiagnosed in early life, they may increase the risk of later life cognitive and mental health disorders. Subtests from the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery (LNNB) discriminate sensorimotor impairments predictive of sensorimotor dysfunction. However, scoring the LNNB sensorimotor assessment is highly subjective and time consuming, impeding the use of this task in epidemiologic studies. Aim: To train and validate a novel automated and image-derived scoring approach to the LNNB neuro-motor tasks for use in adolescents and young adults. Methods: We selected 46 adolescents (19.6 +/&amp;amp;minus; 2.3 years, 48% male) enrolled in the prospective Public Health Impact of Metal Exposure (PHIME) study. We visually recorded the administration of five conventional sensorimotor LNNB tasks and developed automated scoring alternatives using a novel mathematical approach combining optic flow fields from recorded image sequences on a frame-by-frame basis. We then compared the conventional and image-derived LNNB task scores using Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations. Finally, we provided the accuracy of the novel scoring approach with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (AUC). Results: Image-derived LNNB task scores strongly correlated with conventional scores, which were assessed and confirmed by multiple administrators to limit subjectivity (Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation &amp;amp;ge; 0.70). The novel image-derived scoring approach discriminated participants with low motility (&amp;amp;lt;mean population levels) with a specificity ranging from 70% to 83%, with 70% sensitivity. Conclusions: The novel image-derived LNNB task scores may contribute to the timely assessment of sensorimotor abilities and delays, and may also be effectively used in telemedicine.</p>

	<p>Corticomuscular functional coupling reflects the neuronal communication between cortical oscillations and muscle activity. Although the motor cortex is significantly involved in complex motor tasks, there is still no detailed understanding of the cortical contribution during such tasks. In this paper, we first propose a vine copula model to describe corticomuscular functional coupling and we construct the brain muscle function network. First, we recorded surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals corresponding to the hand open, hand close, wrist flexion, and wrist extension motions of 12 participants during the initial experiments. The pre-processed signals were translated into the marginal density functions of different channels through the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model. Subsequently, we calculated the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, and used the R-vine model to decompose the multi-dimensional marginal density function into two-dimensional copula coefficient to determine the structure of the R-vine. Finally, we used the normalized adjacency matrix to structure the corticomuscular network for each hand motion considered. Based on the adjacency matrix, we found that the Kendall rank correlation coefficient between EEG and EMG was low. Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the correlation between the C3 and EMG signals for the different hand-motion activities. We also observed two core nodes in the networks corresponding to the four activities when the vine copula model was applied. Moreover, there was a large difference in the connections of the network models corresponding to the different hand-motion activities. Therefore, we believe that our approach is sufficiently accurate in identifying and classifying motor tasks.</p>

	<p>Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of chronic dizziness associated with significant morbidity, and perhaps constitutes the commonest cause of chronic dizziness across outpatient neurology settings. Patients present with altered perception of balance control, resulting in measurable changes in balance function, such as stiffening of postural muscles and increased body sway. Observed risk factors include pre-morbid anxiety and neuroticism and increased visual dependence. Following a balance-perturbing insult (such as vestibular dysfunction), patients with PPPD adopt adaptive strategies that become chronically maladaptive and impair longer-term postural behaviour. In this article, we explore the relationship between behavioural postural changes, perceptual abnormalities, and imaging correlates of such dysfunction. We argue that understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of PPPD necessitates an integrated methodological approach that is able to concurrently measure behaviour, perception, and cortical and subcortical brain function.</p>

                Background: To compare and correlate the maxillary sinus dimensions and basal bone height among various facial patterns using CBCT for advanced diagnosis and treatment planning in Orthodontics. Methods: 66 CBCT images within age group of 18-30 years were divided into horizontal (Group 1), average (Group 2) and vertical (Group 3) facial growth patterns. Maxillary sinus dimensions were compared and correlated in all three groups. The sinus height and basal bone height were recorded at 3 locations-between 1st premolar and 2nd premolar (PM1-PM2), between 2nd premolar and 1st Molar (PM2-M1) and between 1st and 2nd molar (M1-M2). Results: Overall reduction in sinus height and significantly reduced sinus volume was seen in Group-1. Longest maxillary sinus height in M1-M2 region and shortest in PM1-PM2 region was seen in Group-3. The basal bone height in PM1-PM2 region was significantly longer in Group-3 than in Group-1(p<.05).Shortest basal bone height in M1-M2 region was seen in Group-3. A significant negative correlation was seen between the maxillary sinus height and the basal bone height in Group-1 and Group-3(p<.05). Conclusion: There is a correlation between the maxillary sinus height and basal bone height with that of facial pattern which needs to be considered during orthodontic treatment planning and while carrying out facial growth modification procedures in younger patients.

                Background: Standardised neonatal referral forms (NRFs) facilitate effective communication between healthcare providers and ensure continuity of care between facilities, which are essential for patient safety. We sought to determine the essential data items, or core clinical information (CCI), that should be conveyed for neonatal inter-hospital transfer in resource-limited settings (Rounds 1 to 3) and to create an NRF suitable for our setting (Round 4). Methods: We conducted an international, four-round, modified Delphi-consensus study. Round-1 was a literature and internet search to identify existing NRFs. In Round-2 and -3, participants were Rwandan clinicians and international paediatric healthcare practitioners who had worked in Rwanda in the five years before the study. These participants evaluated the draft items and proposed additional items to be included in an NRF. Round-4 focused on creating the NRF and used five focus groups of Rwandan general practitioners at district hospitals. Results: We identified 16 pre-existing NRFs containing 125 individual items. Of these, 91 items met the pre-defined consensus criteria for inclusion in Round-2. Only 33 items were present in more than 50% of the 16 NRFs, confirming the need for this consensus study. In Round-2, participants proposed 12 new items, six of which met the pre-defined consensus criteria. In Round-3, participants scored items for importance, and 57 items met the final consensus criteria. In Round-4, 29 general practitioners took part in five focus groups; a total of 16 modifications were utilised to finalise the NRF. Conclusions: We generated a novel, robust, NRF that may be readily employed in resource-limited settings to communicate the essential clinical information to accompany a neonate requiring inter-hospital transfer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Impact of Green Practices in Value Chain on Firm Performance in the Context of a Developing Country [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Companies need to go green to remain relevant. Previous studies have confirmed that going green leads to superior performance for companies. However, research of green practices in a value chain requires further attention, especially in identifying the green value chain activities that lead to superior performance. A value chain analysis focuses on identifying competitive advantages of firms through five primary and four support activities. Methods: This study extends from Ong et al. (2019), who developed and validated the instrument for the nine green value chain activities, to also examine their effect on firm performance. The 207 valid responses in this study are collected through a questionnaire survey of the sampling frame consisting of companies in Bursa Malaysia and the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Directory. Results: The findings reveal that the companies’ green practices in primary value chain activities are higher than in the supporting value chain activities. Technological development is the activity with the lowest green attention among the nine value chain activities. Our multiple regression analysis shows that 25% of the variation in firm performance can be significantly explained by the nine green value chain activities. In terms of the individual green value chain activities, green technology development is the only activity that can positively and significantly explain firm performance. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that companies intending to build their green core competence need to engage in green technology development. Companies that go green for the purpose of complying to regulations and fulfilling minimum customers’ demands can still embed green practices into their green value chain without compromising their performance.

                <p>by Colin Campbell, Laura Russo, Réka Albert, Angus Buckling, Katriona Shea</p>

The impact of invasion by a single non-native species on the function and structure of ecological communities can be significant, and the effects can become more drastic–and harder to predict–when multiple species invade as a group. Here we modify a dynamic Boolean model of plant-pollinator community assembly to consider the invasion of native communities by multiple invasive species that are selected either randomly or such that the invaders constitute a stable community. We show that, compared to random invasion, whole community invasion leads to final stable communities (where the initial process of species turnover has given way to a static or near-static set of species in the community) including both native and non-native species that are larger, more likely to retain native species, and which experience smaller changes to the topological measures of nestedness and connectance. We consider the relationship between the prevalence of mutualistic interactions among native and invasive species in the final stable communities and demonstrate that mutualistic interactions may act as a buffer against significant disruptions to the native community.

This tool employs a newly developed mixed Student’s <i>t</i>-test statistical method that detects high-scoring binding sites utilizing conservation information among species. The program performs sequence scanning at a rate of 3.2 Mbp/s on a quad-core Amazon server and has been benchmarked by the well-established ChIP-Seq datasets, putting Grit amongst the top-ranked TFBS predictors. It significantly outperforms the well-known transcription factor motif scanning tools, Pscan (4.8%) and FIMO (17.8%), in analyzing well-documented ChIP-Atlas human genome Chip-Seq datasets.</p> Significance <p>Grit is a good alternative to current available motif scanning tools.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The aesthetic value of reef fishes is globally mismatched to their conservation priorities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juliette Langlois, François Guilhaumon, Florian Baletaud, Nicolas Casajus, Cédric De Almeida Braga, Valentine Fleuré, Michel Kulbicki, Nicolas Loiseau, David Mouillot, Julien P. Renoult, Aliénor Stahl, Rick D. Stuart Smith, Anne-Sophie Tribot, Nicolas Mouquet</p>

Reef fishes are closely connected to many human populations, yet their contributions to society are mostly considered through their economic and ecological values. Cultural and intrinsic values of reef fishes to the public can be critical drivers of conservation investment and success, but remain challenging to quantify. Aesthetic value represents one of the most immediate and direct means by which human societies engage with biodiversity, and can be evaluated from species to ecosystems. Here, we provide the aesthetic value of 2,417 ray-finned reef fish species by combining intensive evaluation of photographs of fishes by humans with predicted values from machine learning. We identified important biases in species’ aesthetic value relating to evolutionary history, ecological traits, and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threat status. The most beautiful fishes are tightly packed into small parts of both the phylogenetic tree and the ecological trait space. In contrast, the less attractive fishes are the most ecologically and evolutionary distinct species and those recognized as threatened. Our study highlights likely important mismatches between potential public support for conservation and the species most in need of this support. It also provides a pathway for scaling-up our understanding of what are both an important nonmaterial facet of biodiversity and a key component of nature’s contribution to people, which could help better anticipate consequences of species loss and assist in developing appropriate communication strategies.

                <p>Autosomal-dominant, Dutch-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D-CAA) offers a unique opportunity to develop biomarkers for pre-symptomatic CAA. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures of white matter injury would be present and progressive in D-CAA prior to hemorrhagic lesions or symptomatic hemorrhage. In a longitudinal cohort of D-CAA carriers and non-carriers, we observed divergence of white matter injury measures between D-CAA carriers and non-carriers prior to the appearance of cerebral microbleeds and &gt;14 years before the average age of first symptomatic hemorrhage. These results indicate that white matter disruption measures may be valuable cross-sectional and longitudinal biomarkers of D-CAA progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differences in the length of postoperative care of endoscopic endonasal surgery in simple and complex surgical procedure groups [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid development of endoscopic endonasal surgery has made the procedure widely used in nasal and sinus surgery. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, but the possibility of postoperative damage to the sinonasal mucosa cannot be ruled out. The aim of this study was to analyze the difference in the length of postoperative care between complex and simple endoscopic endonasal surgeries which can be used as a reference in planning postoperative care.   Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study. The participants were divided into two groups, i.e., simple, and complex surgical procedures groups. The simple procedure group consisted of middle meatal anstrostomy, uncinectomy, endoscopic septoplasty, and endoscopic turbinoplasty. The complex procedure group included frontal sinusotomy, sphenoidectomy, as well as anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy. The length of postoperative care between the two groups were measured and analyzed using the Chi-square test.   Results: The median length of care in the complex procedure group was significantly longer than that in the simple procedure group (p = 0.028), 12 weeks and 9 weeks, respectively. The number of postoperative outpatient visits was significantly less in the simple procedure group compared with the complex procedure group (Median 4 vs. 5; p=0.015). There was a significant correlation between length of care and the endonasal endoscopic surgical procedure group (p = 0.023).   Conclusions: The complex endoscopic endonasal surgery group required a longer length of care and more postoperative outpatient visit than the simple procedure group.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast bacterial growth reduces antibiotic accumulation and efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Phenotypic variations between individual microbial cells play a key role in the resistance of microbial pathogens to pharmacotherapies. Nevertheless, little is known about cell individuality in antibiotic accumulation. Here, we hypothesise that phenotypic diversification can be driven by fundamental cell-to-cell differences in drug transport rates. To test this hypothesis, we employed microfluidics-based single-cell microscopy, libraries of fluorescent antibiotic probes and mathematical modelling. This approach allowed us to rapidly identify phenotypic variants that avoid antibiotic accumulation within populations of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Crucially, we found that fast growing phenotypic variants avoid macrolide accumulation and survive treatment without genetic mutations. These findings are in contrast with the current consensus that cellular dormancy and slow metabolism underlie bacterial survival to antibiotics. Our results also show that fast growing variants display significantly higher expression of ribosomal promoters before drug treatment compared to slow growing variants. Drug-free active ribosomes facilitate essential cellular processes in these fast-growing variants, including efflux that can reduce macrolide accumulation. We used this new knowledge to eradicate variants that displayed low antibiotic accumulation through the chemical manipulation of their outer membrane inspiring new avenues to overcome current antibiotic treatment failures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional coupling between TRPV4 channel and TMEM16F modulates human trophoblast fusion</a></h4>

              
                TMEM16F, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase), is critical for placental trophoblast syncytialization, HIV infection, and SARS-CoV2-mediated syncytialization, however, how TMEM16F is activated during cell fusion is unclear. Here, using trophoblasts as a model for cell fusion, we demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid channel TRPV4 is critical for TMEM16F activation and plays a role in subsequent human trophoblast fusion. GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 specific agonist, robustly activates TMEM16F in trophoblasts. We also show that TRPV4 and TMEM16F are functionally coupled within Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains in a human trophoblast cell line using patch clamp electrophysiology. Pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of TRPV4 hinders TMEM16F activation and subsequent trophoblast syncytialization. Our study uncovers the functional expression of TRPV4 and one of the physiological activation mechanisms of TMEM16F in human trophoblasts, thus providing us with novel strategies to regulate CaPLSase activity as a critical checkpoint of physiologically- and disease-relevant cell fusion events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells driven by T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling predominantly infiltrate Trypanosoma cruzi-infected hearts</a></h4>

              
                Increasing attention has been directed to cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4CTLs) in different pathologies, both in humans and mice. The impact of CD4CTLs in immunity and the mechanisms controlling their generation, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we show that CD4CTLs abundantly differentiate during mouse infection with the intracellular parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>. CD4CTLs display parallel kinetics to Th1 cells in the spleen, mediate specific cytotoxicity against cells presenting pathogen-derived antigens and express immunoregulatory and/or exhaustion markers. We demonstrate that CD4CTL absolute numbers and activity are severely reduced in both <i>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Il18ra<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Of note, the infection of mixed-bone marrow chimeras revealed that WT but not <i>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells transcribe the CD4CTL gene signature and that <i>Il18ra<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup></i> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells phenocopy each other. Moreover, adoptive transfer of WT CD4<sup>+</sup>GzB<sup>+</sup> T cells to infected <i>Il18ra<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice extended their survival. Importantly, cells expressing the CD4CTL phenotype predominate among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating the infected mouse cardiac tissue and are increased in the blood of Chagas patients, in which the frequency of CD4CTLs correlates with the severity of cardiomyopathy. Our findings describe CD4CTLs as a major player in immunity to a relevant human pathogen and disclose T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling as a key pathway controlling the magnitude of the CD4CTL response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The control and training of single motor units in isometric tasks are constrained by a common input signal</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in neural interfaces enable the real-time and non-invasive tracking of motor neuron spiking activity. Such novel interfaces could provide a promising basis for human motor augmentation by extracting potentially high-dimensional control signals directly from the human nervous system. However, it is unclear how flexibly humans can control the activity of individual motor neurons to effectively increase the number of degrees-of-freedom available to coordinate multiple effectors simultaneously. Here, we provided human subjects (N=7) with real-time feedback on the discharge patterns of pairs of motor units (MUs) innervating a single muscle (tibialis anterior) and encouraged them to independently control the MUs by tracking targets in a 2D space. Subjects learned control strategies to achieve the target-tracking task for various combinations of MUs. These strategies rarely corresponded to a volitional control of independent input signals to individual MUs during the onset of neural activity. Conversely, MU activation was consistent with a common input to the MU pair, while individual activation of the MUs in the pair was predominantly achieved by alterations in de-recruitment order that could be explained with history-dependent changes in motor neuron excitability. These results suggest that flexible MU recruitment based on independent synaptic inputs to single MUs is unlikely, although de-recruitment might reflect varying inputs or modulations in the neuron's intrinsic excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tonic inhibition of the chloride/proton antiporter ClC-7 by PI(3,5)P2 is crucial for lysosomal pH maintenance</a></h4>

              
                The acidic luminal pH of lysosomes, maintained within a narrow range, is essential for proper degrative function of the organelle and is generated by the action of a V-type H<sup>+</sup> ATPase, but other pathways for ion movement are required to dissipate the voltage generated by this process. ClC-7, a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter responsible for lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability, is a candidate to contribute to the acidification process as part of this 'counterion pathway'. The signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2 modulates lysosomal dynamics, including by regulating lysosomal ion channels, raising the possibility that it could contribute to lysosomal pH regulation. Here we demonstrate that depleting PI(3,5)P2 by inhibiting the PIKfyve kinase causes lysosomal hyperacidification, primarily via an effect on ClC-7. We further show that PI(3,5)P2 directly inhibits ClC-7 transport and that this inhibition is eliminated in a disease-causing gain-of-function ClC-7 mutation. Together these observations suggest an intimate role for ClC-7 in lysosomal pH regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A mechanism with severing near barbed ends andannealing explains structure and dynamics of dendriticactin networks</a></h4>

              
                Single molecule imaging has shown that part of actin disassembles within a few seconds after incorporation into the dendritic filament network in lamellipodia, suggestive of frequent destabilization near barbed ends. To investigate the mechanisms behind network remodeling, we created a stochastic model with polymerization, depolymerization, branching, capping, uncapping, severing, oligomer diffusion, annealing, and debranching. We find that filament severing, enhanced near barbed ends, can explain the single molecule actin lifetime distribution, if oligomer fragments reanneal to free ends with rate constants comparable to in vitro measurements. The same mechanism leads to actin networks consistent with measured filament, end, and branch concentrations. These networks undergo structural remodeling, leading to longer filaments away from the leading edge, at the +/- 35&#x1D45C; orientation pattern. Imaging of actin speckle lifetimes at sub-second resolution verifies frequent disassembly of newly-assembled actin. We thus propose a unified mechanism that fits a diverse set of basic lamellipodia phenomenology.

                We report the real-time response of E. coli to lactoferricin-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) on length-scales bridging microscopic cell-sizes to nanoscopic lipid packing using millisecond time-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering. Coupling a multi-scale scattering data analysis to biophysical assays for peptide partitioning revealed that the AMPs rapidly permeabilize the cytosolic membrane within less than three seconds-much faster than previously considered. Final intracellular AMP concentrations of ~ 80 to 100 mM suggest an efficient obstruction of physiologically important processes as primary cause for bacterial killing. On the other hand, damage of the cell envelope and leakage occurred also at sublethal peptide concentrations, thus emerging as a collateral effect of AMP activity that does not kill the bacteria. This implies that the impairment of the membrane barrier is a necessary but not sufficient condition for microbial killing by lactoferricins. The most efficient AMP studied exceeds others in both speed of permeabilizing membranes and lowest intracellular peptide concentration needed to inhibit bacterial growth.

                Visual perception in adult humans is thought to be optimised to represent the statistical regularities of natural scenes (e.g. Parraga et al., 2000; Simoncelli, 2003). In infancy and early childhood, visual input is required to drive visual development (Berardi et al., 2000; Blakemore & Cooper, 1970; Jand&oacute et al., 2012; Knudsen, 2004), but whether or not scene statistics are extracted and represented colour is currently unknown. In adults, visual sensitivity to different hues shows an asymmetry, which relates to the statistical regularity of colour in the natural world (Bosten et al., 2015). We measured colour discrimination in infants to investigate whether or not the visual system can in very early life represent scene statistics. Our results reveal the earliest association between vision and natural scene statistics that has yet been found: even as young as four months of age, colour vision is aligned with the distributions of colours in natural scenes.

                Ifit2, an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2, plays a critical role in restricting neurotropic murine {beta}-coronavirus RSA59 infection. RSA59 intracranial injection of Ifit2 deficient (-/-) compared to wild type (WT) mice results in impaired acute microglial activation, associated with reduced CX3CR1 expression, which consecutively limits migration of peripheral lymphocytes into the brain, leading to impaired virus control followed by severe morbidity and mortality. While the protective role of Ifit2 is established for acute viral encephalitis, less is known about its influence on demyelination during the chronic phase of RSA59 infection. Our current study demonstrates that Ifit2 deficiency causes extensive RSA59 viral spread throughout both the spinal cord grey and white matter and is associated with impaired CD4 + T cell infiltration. Cervical lymph nodes of RSA59 infected Ifit2 -/- mice showed reduced activation of CD4 + T cells and impaired IFN{gamma} expression during acute encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, blood-brain-barrier integrity was preserved in the absence of Ifit2 as evidenced by integral, tight junction protein ZO-1 expression surrounding the meninges and blood vessels and decreased Texas red dye uptake. In contrast to WT mice exhibiting only sparse myelin loss, the chronic disease phase in Ifit2-/- mice was associated with severe demyelination and persistent viral load, even at low infection doses. Overall, our study highlights that Ifit2 provides antiviral functions by promoting acute neuroinflammation and thereby aiding virus control and limiting severe demyelination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals apoE4-dependent phosphorylation of the actin-regulating protein VASP</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers Disease (AD). While neurons generally produce a minority of the apoE in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of apoE increases dramatically in response to stress and is sufficient to drive pathology. Currently, the molecular mechanisms of how apoE4 expression may regulate pathology are not fully understood. Here we expand upon our previous studies measuring the impact of apoE4 on protein abundance to include the analysis of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling in isogenic Neuro-2a cells expressing apoE3 or apoE4. ApoE4 expression resulted in a dramatic increase in VASP S235 phosphorylation in a PKA-dependent manner. This phosphorylation disrupted VASP interactions with numerous actin cytoskeletal and microtubular proteins. Reduction of VASP S235 phosphorylation via PKA inhibition resulted in a significant increase in filopodia formation and neurite outgrowth in apoE4-expressing cells, exceeding levels observed in apoE3-expressing cells. Our results highlight the pronounced and diverse impact of apoE4 on multiple modes of protein regulation and identify potential therapeutic targets to restore apoE4-related cytoskeletal defects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generalization reveals asymmetric and history-dependent control networks for multi-finger dexterous movements</a></h4>

              
                Finger dexterity, fundamental in our daily lives, is manifested by the generation of multi-finger and multi-directional patterns of muscles activity during various motor tasks, and further, by the generalization of learning in one context to other contexts. Tying shoelaces, for example, requires precise coordination of multiple fingers, some active primarily in the flexion direction, others in the extension direction, and some immobile. Nevertheless, whether the control processes of these actions are independent or interact and potentially generalize across each other, remains unclear. In a set of experiments, we sought to characterize the behavioral principles underlying the control process, learning and generalization of dexterous extension and flexion movements. We developed an isometric dexterity task that precisely measures dexterity in terms of finger individuation, force accuracy and temporal synchronization during finger flexion and extension. First, we investigated learning and generalization abilities across flexion and extension directions, both within and across hands. To do so, two groups of participants were trained for 3 days in either the flexion or extension direction. We found improvement in all dexterity measures in both groups following training, though finger extension generally exhibited inferior dexterity. Surprisingly, while the newly acquired finger extension abilities generalized to the untrained flexion direction, the newly acquired finger flexion abilities did not generalize to the untrained extension direction. Generalization biases of the finger flexion direction were also evident in the untrained hand. Next, we examined whether the asymmetric generalization pattern of multi-finger dexterous movements was history dependent. We thus recruited skilled musicians who showed increased baseline levels of dexterity in both directions and found that the degree to which learning generalizes between two contexts was affected by prior experience. Overall, our data indicate that control of multi-digit dexterous patterns is direction-specific in humans, supporting the hypothesis that control circuits for learning of finger flexion and extension are overlapped in that they partially, but asymmetrically, transfer between directions. This ability, however, is modular as it depends on hand use and the history of prior training.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fine-scale dynamics of functional connectivity in the face processing network during movie watching</a></h4>

              
                Face are naturally dynamic, multimodal and embedded in rich social context. However, mapping the face processing network in the human brain and its relation to behavior is typically done during rest or using isolated, static face images. The use of such contrived stimuli might result in overlooking widespread cortical interactions obtained in response to naturalistic context and the temporal dynamics of these interactions. Here we examined large-scale cortical connectivity patterns measured in response to a dynamic movie in a sample of typical adults (n=517), to determine how inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC) relates to face recognition scores. We found a positive correlation with recognition scores in edges connecting the occipital visual and anterior temporal regions and a negative correlation in edges connecting attentional dorsal, frontal default, and occipital visual regions. These ISFC patterns resembled previous findings comparing individuals with congenital prosopagnosia to normal controls and the viewing of inverted compared to upright faces. To further examine these connectivity patterns, we developed a novel method that allows analysis of inter-subject stimulus-evoked node/edge responses at a single TR resolution. Using this method, we demonstrated that co-fluctuations in face-selective edges observed here and in previous work are related to local activity in core face-selective regions. Finally, correlating this temporal decomposition of the observed ISFC patterns to the movie content revealed that they peak during boundaries between movie segments rather than during the presence of faces in the movie. Our novel approach demonstrates how visual processing of faces is linked to fine-scale dynamics in attentional, memory, and perceptual neural circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sound Frequency Predicts the Bodily Location of Auditory-Induced Tactile Sensations in Synesthetic and Ordinary Perception</a></h4>

              
                For individuals who experience sound-touch synesthesia, sounds consistently evoke strong, localized sensations on the body. Interestingly, visual and auditory information can also evoke bodily sensations in ordinary perception, such as the sight or sound of a mosquito producing phantom sensations of touch. We systematically investigated the functional relationship between sound frequency and several characteristics of induced tactile experiences in synesthetes and controls. Sound frequency strongly predicted the location of tactile sensations on the body in both synesthetes and controls. Synesthetes felt sound-induced touch more frequently and in significantly more concentrated locations on their bodies compared to sound-induced touch perceptions in controls. This spatial distribution of touch reflects a behavioral mapping between tonotopy and somatotopy that suggests the involvement of early, tonotopically- and somatotopically-organized brain areas. Sound frequency also predicted the hardness, roughness, and sharpness of tactile sensations in both groups. Together, these findings highlight a strong similarity between auditory-tactile mappings in synesthetic and ordinary perception, suggesting that synesthesia only differs in the strength of the mappings and therefore is on a spectrum with ordinary perception. Furthermore, these findings offer insights into the possible underlying neural mechanisms of sound-touch mappings, suggesting that they rely on cross-modal neural pathways already in use in ordinary perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic decoupling of salience and default mode networks by optogenetic manipulation of anterior insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                The salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) are among the most widely investigated networks in the human brain. The SN, anchored in the anterior insular cortex (AI), is thought to play a critical role in stimulus-driven suppression of DMN nodes. However, the causal neural mechanisms underlying DMN suppression and SN-DMN interactions are poorly understood. Here we combine feedforward optogenetic AI stimulation with fMRI and computational modeling to dissect the causal role of AI in dynamic functional interactions between SN and DMN nodes in the rat brain. Optogenetic stimulation of Chronos-expressing AI neurons in rats suppressed DMN activity and decreased AI-DMN and intra-DMN functional connectivity. Our findings demonstrate that feedforward optogenetic stimulation of AI neurons induces dynamic suppression and decoupling of the DMN and elucidates previously unknown features of rodent brain network organization. Our study advances foundational knowledge of causal mechanisms underlying dynamic cross-network interactions and brain network switching.

	<p>Very few studies have investigated online spoken word recognition in templatic languages. In this study, we investigated both lexical (neighborhood density and frequency) and morphological (role of root morpheme) aspects of spoken word recognition of Hebrew, a templatic language, using the traditional gating paradigm. Additionally, we compared the traditional gating paradigm with a novel, phoneme-based gating paradigm. The phoneme-based approach allows for better control of information available at each gate. We found lexical effects with high-frequency words and low neighborhood density words being recognized at earlier gates. We also found that earlier access to root-morpheme information enabled word recognition at earlier gates. Finally, we showed that both the traditional gating paradigm and gating by phoneme paradigm yielded equivalent results.</p>

	<p>A major proportion of people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PwP) in Germany has written an advance directive (AD). Unfortunately, these ADs are unclear for PD-specific endpoints. We previously established consensus-based recommendations for disease-specific content of an AD in PwP. However, the implementation of those recommendations and the consulting of AD creation and modification in PwP remains to be evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the practical use of PD-specific recommendations for ADs in outpatient settings. A total of 87 physicians (45 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 neurologists, 10% response rate) answered a self-constructed semiquantitative questionnaire. The participants were asked to evaluate the suggested PD-specific recommendations for ADs and the supply of palliative care in the outpatient setting. Overall, the vast majority of treating physicians agreed on the usefulness of the newly constructed PD-specific recommendations. Consultations to discuss information about PD-specific ADs were scarce with short durations. Only 24% of participating physicians implemented the PD-specific recommendations in their daily practice. GPs and neurologists agreed on the benefit of disease-specific recommendations for ADs. In future, a more general integration of these recommendations in routine care might improve specific AD creation of PwP and advanced care planning.</p>

	<p>Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is a rare but devastating complication of advanced cancer. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma are the three most common causes of LMC, whereas it is rare in ovarian cancer. Here, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who was diagnosed with LMC from ovarian cancer and was successfully treated with intrathecal chemotherapy via Ommaya reservoir and radiation therapy. The patient had an amelioration of symptoms and prolonged survival. Though LMC from ovarian cancer is thought to be rare, it is not going to remain a rare entity because the incidence of LMC in general is thought to be increasing, which is also the case with ovarian cancer. According to 31 cases whose treatment course is reported in literature, despite the absence of an established treatment for LMC, intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy whose survival benefit has been suggested in past studies might also prolong survival in patients with LMC from ovarian cancer. IT chemotherapy via Ommaya reservoir may be preferred to the lumbar puncture route. The presentation of non-specific symptoms of LMC in patients may hinder its diagnosis; however, early diagnosis and treatment induction is the key for patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prolonged survival and restored useful life.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Patients with occlusal disharmony (OD) may be susceptible to depression. The hypothalamus&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal axis, 5-HT and 5HT2AR in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus are involved in the modulation of emotion and depression. This study investigated whether OD affects the HPA axis and 5-HT system and, subsequently, produces depression-like behaviors in rats. Materials and methods: OD was produced by removing 0.5 and 0.25 mm of hard tissue from the cusps of the maxillary molars in randomly selected sides of Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats. CUS involved exposure to 2 different stressors per day for 35 days. OD-, CUS-, and OD + CUS-treated groups and an untreated control group were compared in terms of behavior, endocrine status and brain histology. Results: There were significant differences among the four groups in the behavior tests (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), especially in the sucrose preference test, where there was a significant decrease in the OD group compared to the control group. ACTH and CORT concentrations were significantly higher in the OD + CUS group than the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Expression of GR and 5-HT2AR in the PFC, amygdala and hippocampal CA1 was significantly higher in the OD, CUS and OD + CUS groups than the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: OD promotes depression-like behaviors through peripheral and central pathways via the HPA axis, GR and 5-HT system.</p>

	<p>Excellent response inhibition is the basis for outstanding competitive athletic performance, and sleep may be an important factor affecting athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; response inhibition. This study investigates the effect of sleep deprivation on athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; response inhibition, and its differentiating effect on non-athlete controls&amp;amp;rsquo; performance, with the aim of helping athletes effectively improve their response inhibition ability through sleep pattern manipulation. Behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data were collected from 36 participants (16 table tennis athletes and 20 general college students) after 36 h of sleep deprivation using ERP techniques and a stop-signal task. Sleep deprivation&amp;amp;rsquo;s different effects on response inhibition in the two groups were explored through repeated-measures ANOVA. Behavioral data showed that in a baseline state, stop-signal response time was significantly faster in table tennis athletes than in non-athlete controls, and appeared significantly longer after sleep deprivation in both groups. ERP results showed that at baseline state, N2, ERN, and P3 amplitudes were lower in table tennis athletes than in non-athlete controls, and corresponding significant decreases were observed in non-athlete controls after 36 h of sleep deprivation. Table tennis athletes showed a decrease in P3 amplitude and no significant difference in N2 and ERN amplitudes, after 36 h of sleep deprivation compared to the baseline state. Compared to non-athlete controls, table tennis athletes had better response inhibition, and the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on response inhibition occurred mainly in the later top-down motor inhibition process rather than in earlier automated conflict detection and monitoring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline is Reversed by D-Serine Supplementation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain aging is a natural process that involves structural and functional changes that lead to cognitive decline, even in healthy subjects. This detriment has been associated with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction because of a reduction in the brain levels of D-serine, the endogenous NMDAR co-agonist. However, it is not clear whether D-serine supplementation could be used as an intervention to reduce or reverse age-related brain alterations. In the present work, we aimed to analyze the D-serine effect on aging-associated alterations in cellular and large-scale brain systems that could support cognitive flexibility in rats. We found that D-serine supplementation reverts the age-related decline in cognitive flexibility, frontal dendritic spine density, and partially restored large-scale functional connectivity without inducing nephrotoxicity; instead, D-serine restored the thickness of the renal epithelial cells that were affected by age. Our results suggest that D-serine could be used as a therapeutic target to reverse age-related brain alterations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Selectively Imaging Cranial Sensory Ganglion Neurons Using AAV-PHP.S</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Because of their ease of use, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are indispensable tools for much of neuroscience. Yet AAVs have been used relatively little to study the identities and connectivity of peripheral sensory neurons, principally because methods to selectively target peripheral neurons have been limited. The introduction of the AAV-PHP.S capsid with enhanced tropism for peripheral neurons (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Chan et al., 2017</cross-ref>) offered a solution, which we further elaborate here. Using AAV-PHP.S with GFP or mScarlet fluorescent proteins, we show that the mouse sensory ganglia for cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X are targeted. Pseudounipolar neurons of both somatic and visceral origin, but not satellite glia, express the reporters. One week after virus injection, 66% of geniculate ganglion neurons were transduced. Fluorescent reporters were transported along the central and peripheral axons of these sensory neurons, permitting visualization of terminals at high resolution, and in intact, cleared brain using light sheet microscopy. Further, using a Cre-dependent reporter, we demonstrate by anatomic and functional criteria, that expression is in a cell type-selective manner. Finally, we integrate earlier neuroanatomical and molecular data with <I>in vivo</I> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to demonstrate the sensory characteristics of geniculate ganglion auricular neurons, which were previously undocumented. Our analyses suggest that the AAV-PHP.S serotype will be a powerful tool for anatomically and functionally mapping the receptive fields and circuits of the expanding numbers of molecular subtypes of many somatosensory and viscerosensory neurons that continue to be defined via single-cell RNA sequencing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multitask fMRI Data Classification via Group-Wise Hybrid Temporal and Spatial Sparse Representations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) has been widely used to induce functional brain activities corresponding to various cognitive tasks. A relatively under-explored question is whether there exist fundamental differences in fMRI signal composition patterns that can effectively classify the task states of tfMRI data, furthermore, whether there exist key functional components in characterizing the diverse tfMRI signals. Recently, fMRI signal composition patterns of multiple tasks have been investigated via deep learning models, where relatively large populations of fMRI datasets are indispensable and the neurologic meaning of their results is elusive. Thus, the major challenges arise from the high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, interindividual variability, a small sample size of fMRI data, and the explainability of classification results. To address the above challenges, we proposed a computational framework based on group-wise hybrid temporal and spatial sparse representations (HTSSR) to identify and differentiate multitask fMRI signal composition patterns. Using relatively small cohorts of Human Connectome Project (HCP) tfMRI data as test-bed, the experimental results demonstrated that the multitask of fMRI data can be successfully classified with an average accuracy of 96.67%, where the key components in differentiating the multitask can be characterized, suggesting the effectiveness and explainability of the proposed method. Moreover, both task-related components and resting-state networks (RSNs) can be reliably detected. Therefore, our study proposed a novel framework that identifies the interpretable and discriminative fMRI composition patterns and can be potentially applied for controlling fMRI data quality and inferring biomarkers in brain disorders with small sample neuroimaging datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-monotonic effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs on neuronal firing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aghil Abed Zadeh, Brandon D. Turner, Nicole Calakos, Nicolas Brunel</p>

GABA is generally known as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, usually acting by hyperpolarizing membrane potential. However, GABAergic currents sometimes exhibit non-inhibitory effects, depending on the brain region, developmental stage or pathological condition. Here, we investigate the diverse effects of GABA on the firing rate of several single neuron models, using both analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We find that GABAergic synaptic conductance and output firing rate exhibit three qualitatively different regimes as a function of GABA reversal potential, <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub>: monotonically decreasing for sufficiently low <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> (inhibitory), monotonically increasing for <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> above firing threshold (excitatory); and a non-monotonic region for intermediate values of <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub>. In the non-monotonic regime, small GABA conductances have an excitatory effect while large GABA conductances show an inhibitory effect. We provide a phase diagram of different GABAergic effects as a function of GABA reversal potential and glutamate conductance. We find that noisy inputs increase the range of <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> for which the non-monotonic effect can be observed. We also construct a micro-circuit model of striatum to explain observed effects of GABAergic fast spiking interneurons on spiny projection neurons, including non-monotonicity, as well as the heterogeneity of the effects. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of paradoxical effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs, with implications for understanding the effects of GABA in neural computation and development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deciphering clock cell network morphology within the biological master clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus: From the perspective of circadian wave dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hyun Kim, Cheolhong Min, Byeongha Jeong, Kyoung J. Lee</p>

The biological master clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus (of rat and mouse), is composed of ~10,000 clock cells which are heterogeneous with respect to their circadian periods. Despite this inhomogeneity, an intact SCN maintains a very good degree of circadian phase (time) coherence which is vital for sustaining various circadian rhythmic activities, and it is supposedly achieved by not just one but a few different cell-to-cell coupling mechanisms, among which action potential (AP)-mediated connectivity is known to be essential. But, due to technical difficulties and limitations in experiments, so far very little information is available about the morphology of the connectivity at a cellular scale. Building upon this limited amount of information, here we exhaustively and systematically explore a large pool (~25,000) of various network morphologies to come up with some plausible network features of SCN networks. All candidates under consideration reflect an experimentally obtained ‘indegree distribution’ as well as a ‘physical range distribution of afferent clock cells.’ Then, importantly, with a set of multitude criteria based on the properties of SCN circadian phase waves in extrinsically perturbed as well as in their natural states, we select out appropriate model networks: Some important measures are, 1) level of phase dispersal and direction of wave propagation, 2) phase-resetting ability of the model networks subject to external circadian forcing, and 3) decay rate of perturbation induced “phase-singularities.” The successful, realistic networks have several common features: 1) “indegree” and “outdegree” should have a positive correlation; 2) the cells in the SCN ventrolateral region (core) have a much larger total degree than that of the dorsal medial region (shell); 3) The number of intra-core edges is about 7.5 times that of intra-shell edges; and 4) the distance probability density function for the afferent connections fits well to a beta function. We believe that these newly identified network features would be a useful guide for future explorations on the very much unknown AP-mediated clock cell connectome within the SCN.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing collaborative transcription regulation with a graph-based deep learning approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhenhao Zhang, Fan Feng, Jie Liu</p>

Human epigenome and transcription activities have been characterized by a number of sequence-based deep learning approaches which only utilize the DNA sequences. However, transcription factors interact with each other, and their collaborative regulatory activities go beyond the linear DNA sequence. Therefore leveraging the informative 3D chromatin organization to investigate the collaborations among transcription factors is critical. We developed ECHO, a graph-based neural network, to predict chromatin features and characterize the collaboration among them by incorporating 3D chromatin organization from 200-bp high-resolution Micro-C contact maps. ECHO predicted 2,583 chromatin features with significantly higher average AUROC and AUPR than the best sequence-based model. We observed that chromatin contacts of different distances affected different types of chromatin features’ prediction in diverse ways, suggesting complex and divergent collaborative regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, ECHO was interpretable via gradient-based attribution methods. The attributions on chromatin contacts identify important contacts relevant to chromatin features. The attributions on DNA sequences identify TF binding motifs and TF collaborative binding. Furthermore, combining the attributions on contacts and sequences reveals important sequence patterns in the neighborhood which are relevant to a target sequence’s chromatin feature prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fluid mechanics of the zebrafish embryonic heart trabeculation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adriana Gaia Cairelli, Renee Wei-Yan Chow, Julien Vermot, Choon Hwai Yap</p>

Embryonic heart development is a mechanosensitive process, where specific fluid forces are needed for the correct development, and abnormal mechanical stimuli can lead to malformations. It is thus important to understand the nature of embryonic heart fluid forces. However, the fluid dynamical behaviour close to the embryonic endocardial surface is very sensitive to the geometry and motion dynamics of fine-scale cardiac trabecular surface structures. Here, we conducted image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to quantify the fluid mechanics associated with the zebrafish embryonic heart trabeculae. To capture trabecular geometric and motion details, we used a fish line that expresses fluorescence at the endocardial cell membrane, and high resolution 3D confocal microscopy. Our endocardial wall shear stress (WSS) results were found to exceed those reported in existing literature, which were estimated using myocardial rather than endocardial boundaries. By conducting simulations of single intra-trabecular spaces under varied scenarios, where the translational or deformational motions (caused by contraction) were removed, we found that a squeeze flow effect was responsible for most of the WSS magnitude in the intra-trabecular spaces, rather than the shear interaction with the flow in the main ventricular chamber. We found that trabecular structures were responsible for the high spatial variability of the magnitude and oscillatory nature of WSS, and for reducing the endocardial deformational burden. We further found cells attached to the endocardium within the intra-trabecular spaces, which were likely embryonic hemogenic cells, whose presence increased endocardial WSS. Overall, our results suggested that a complex multi-component consideration of both anatomic features and motion dynamics were needed to quantify the trabeculated embryonic heart fluid mechanics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nanoscale organization of ryanodine receptor distribution and phosphorylation pattern determines the dynamics of calcium sparks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by María Hernández Mesa, Jonas van den Brink, William E. Louch, Kimberly J. McCabe, Padmini Rangamani</p>

Super-resolution imaging techniques have provided a better understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale organization and function of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in cardiomyocytes. Recent data have indicated that this relationship is disrupted in heart failure (HF), as RyRs are dispersed into smaller and more numerous clusters. However, RyRs are also hyperphosphorylated in this condition, and this is reported to occur preferentially within the cluster centre. Thus, the combined impact of RyR relocalization and sensitization on Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark generation in failing cardiomyocytes is likely complex and these observations suggest that both the nanoscale organization of RyRs and the pattern of phosphorylated RyRs within clusters could be critical determinants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we used computational modeling to quantify the relationships between RyR cluster geometry, phosphorylation patterns, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. We found that RyR cluster disruption results in a decrease in spark fidelity and longer sparks with a lower amplitude. Phosphorylation of some RyRs within the cluster can play a compensatory role, recovering healthy spark dynamics. Interestingly, our model predicts that such compensation is critically dependent on the phosphorylation pattern, as phosphorylation localized within the cluster center resulted in longer Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and higher spark fidelity compared to a uniformly distributed phosphorylation pattern. Our results strongly suggest that both the phosphorylation pattern and nanoscale RyR reorganization are critical determinants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in HF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-checking ecological state-transition graphs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Colin Thomas, Maximilien Cosme, Cédric Gaucherel, Franck Pommereau</p>

Model-checking is a methodology developed in computer science to automatically assess the dynamics of discrete systems, by checking if a system modelled as a state-transition graph satisfies a dynamical property written as a temporal logic formula. The dynamics of ecosystems have been drawn as state-transition graphs for more than a century, ranging from state-and-transition models to assembly graphs. Model-checking can provide insights into both empirical data and theoretical models, as long as they sum up into state-transition graphs. While model-checking proved to be a valuable tool in systems biology, it remains largely underused in ecology apart from precursory applications.
This article proposes to address this situation, through an inventory of existing ecological STGs and an accessible presentation of the model-checking methodology. This overview is illustrated by the application of model-checking to assess the dynamics of a vegetation pathways model. We select management scenarios by model-checking Computation Tree Logic formulas representing management goals and built from a proposed catalogue of patterns. In discussion, we sketch bridges between existing studies in ecology and available model-checking frameworks. In addition to the automated analysis of ecological state-transition graphs, we believe that defining ecological concepts with temporal logics could help clarify and compare them.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Finding landmarks–An investigation of viewing behavior during spatial navigation in VR using a graph-theoretical analysis approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jasmin L. Walter, Lucas Essmann, Sabine U. König, Peter König</p>

Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gathering data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows one to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment. The analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined “gaze” events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention. Applying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them “gaze-graph-defined landmarks”. Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible. Our findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Burnout and work satisfaction are differentially associated in gastroenterologists in Germany [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout in the field of gastroenterology is an under-researched phenomenon. So far, only a few studies have dealt with this topic. There are large geographical variations in burnout rates with 16–20% of gastroenterologists in Mexico and Germany being at risk or having burnout, 30–40% in the United Kingdom, and 50–55% in South Korea, Canada, and the USA. The investigation of differential associations of burnout with important factors in gastroenterologists leading to tailored therapy recommendations is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the associations between work satisfaction and burnout in this specialization. Methods: We distributed an electronic survey to gastroenterologists organized mainly in the Federal Organization of Gastroenterology in Germany (the BVGD - Bundesverband Gastroenterologie Deutschland). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) were examined regarding their postulated internal structure in our sample of gastroenterologists. Canonical correlations were performed to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians. Results: An acceptable model fit was shown for both the MBI and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of .62 (p<.001) and .27 (p<.001). The full model across all functions was significant (χ2 (18) = 386.26, p<.001). Burden, personal rewards, and global item regarding the job situation were good predictors for less exhaustion, while patient care and professional relations were good predictors for personal accomplishment. This supports the recognition of burnout as being a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed. Conclusions: Specific interventions should be designed to improve symptoms of burnout in endoscopy physicians according to their individual complaints as burnout is a multidimensional construct. Differential interventions should be offered on the basis of our study results in order to alleviate the issue of work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The genetic causes of male infertility: a Middle East and North Africa perspective [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Male infertility is attributable to 60% of total infertility cases and about 30-50% of these cases remain idiopathic. In the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), male infertility affects about 22.6% of men of reproductive age. Male infertility is caused by a variety of factors, including endocrine disruption, exposure to toxins, lifestyle, genetic and epigenetic modifications. Genetic modifications, including chromosomal abnormalities, chromosomal rearrangements, Y chromosome microdeletions and single-gene mutations, explain for about 10-15% of infertility cases. Since genetic aberration is a key player in the pathogenesis of male infertility, it is important to explore the impact in the MENA region due to the high incidence of male infertility. Therefore, the current study aims to systematically analyse the literature regarding the impact and common causes of male infertility in the MENA region. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. Following the search, a total of 126 articles was retrieved, of which 12 were duplicates and another 69 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, totaling the exclusion of 81 articles. Studies excluded were those that had patient populations originating outside the MENA region, review articles, non-English written articles, or studies where the patient population was under 18 years of age. Findings showed that the frequent genetic aberration leading to male infertility in these regions include Y chromosome microdeletions, gene polymorphisms or copy number variations, mitochondrial microdeletions and other genetic deletions or mutations. In lieu of this, diverse clinical genetic tests should be made available for the proper diagnosis of male infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Realisation of Solid-State Electrochromic Devices Based on Gel Electrolyte [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the last decade, there has been much interest in the area of solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to address the issues of electrolyte leakage and evaporation in electrochromic devices (ECD). ECD is a state-of-the-art technology having the ability to change from transparent state to opaque state under the influence of a small applied voltage for energy saving applications. Methods: In this work, tungsten oxide (WO3) films were fabricated via the sol-gel spin-coating method. Subsequently, ECDs were assembled based on SPE and liquid polymer electrolyte (LPE), respectively using indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass as conducting electrodes and WO3 films as working electrode. Results: Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results revealed reduced ionic conductivity of conducting ions in SPE based ECD (SECD) owing to increased viscosity by addition of PMMA. However, lesser time was required for the colouration process. LPE based ECD (LECD) showed higher colouration efficiency (CE) compared to its SECD counterpart. This is attributed to its larger optical modulation. Conclusions: This work presents a comparison between the performance of LECD and SECD in terms of electrochromic (EC) and optical properties. They were analysed through CV, chronoamperometry (CA) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. Furthermore, this work provides an insight on the employment of solid-state electrolytes in ECDs in view of the persistent leakage and evaporation problems in ECD implementation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evaluating potential vaccine side effects is often a prerequisite to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic more effectively in a low-resource setting where herd immunity could be the most feasible option. Case report: Here, we present, an 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities was admitted into the coronary care unit at Ibn Sina Medical College Hospital (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with severe central chest pain and respiratory distress after receiving the first dose of Moderna vaccine on July 26, 2021. On admission, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, temperature 36.7°C. He had a vesicular breath sound with bilateral basal crepitations and normal heart sounds. On the ECG, significant changes were observed. Other lab findings were significant troponin-I: 1.72 ng/ml, trace protein and glucose in the urine, total white blood cell count: 12820/cm3; HbA1c, 7.5%; serum creatinine, 1.56 mg/dl; serum electrolytes: sodium 133 mmol/L, chloride 92 mmol/L. The patient had a medical history of prior myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension but no chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, or bronchial asthma. After admission, he was treated conservatively with necessary medications and monitored periodically. The patient was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular failure with acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was discharged from the hospital on day six with proper medicinal support with full recovery. Conclusions: Though acute cardiac complications following COVID-19 vaccines are unusual, this case report can contribute to further molecular research to identify the possible role of vaccine compounds in triggering such complications among the general population.

                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr El Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Patients’ medical records were evaluated.   The oral manifestations were assessed according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in SLE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic.  Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with SLE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of SLE a widespread state. Also, the implementation of oral hygiene measures to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life is recommended.

                Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is characterized by a clinical presentation that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is reversible. Alterations of Takotsubo in patients without previous heart disease remain a challenge for diagnosis. Case report: We present a case of an 80-year-old patient from Peru. The patient underwent surgery, with the diagnosis of Chilaiditi’s syndrome. One day after surgery, she presented with dyspnea, tachycardia, and electrocardiographic changes. The diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome with cardiogenic shock and renal failure on hemodialysis was made. She was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and was managed with vasopressors and nitroglycerin. There was no cardiac lesion in the cineangiogram or occlusion of arteries. The patient was extubated and received daily dialysis until discharge. Conclusions: Takotsubo is an emotional, non-cardiac, or post-traumatic stressful event that triggers myocardial injury with segmental anomalous, the possible etiology of which is the release of an endothelial neurotransmitter caused by stress. Emergency physicians should be aware of this as even patients without previous cardiac pathologies when exposed to stressors (such as surgeries) develop emergency symptomatology similar to myocardial infarction. Thus, emergency physicians should identify any cardiac abnormalities after a stressor, as well as be prepared for the diagnosis of TC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reporting of health equity considerations in equity-relevant observational studies: Protocol for a systematic assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mitigation of unfair and avoidable differences in health is an increasing global priority. Observational studies including cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies tend to report social determinants of health which could inform evidence syntheses on health equity and social justice. However, the extent of reporting and analysis of equity in equity-relevant observational studies is unknown. Methods: We define studies which report outcomes for populations at risk of experiencing inequities as “equity-relevant”. Using a random sampling technique we will identify 320 equity-relevant observational studies published between 1 January 2020 to 27 April 2022 by searching the MEDLINE database. We will stratify sampling by 1) studies in high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) according to the World Bank classification, 2) studies focused on COVID and those which are not, 3) studies focused on populations at risk of experiencing inequities and those on general populations that stratify their analyses. We will use the PROGRESS framework which stands for place of residence, race or ethnicity, occupation, gender or sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, to identify dimensions where inequities may exist. Using a previously developed data extraction form we will pilot-test on eligible studies and revise as applicable. Conclusions: The proposed methodological assessment of reporting will allow us to systematically understand the current reporting and analysis practices for health equity in observational studies. The findings of this study will help inform the development of the equity extension for the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology) reporting guidelines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The complete genome sequence of elite bread wheat cultivar, “Sonmez” [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                High-yielding crop varieties will become critical in meeting the future food demand in the face of worsening weather extremes and threatening biotic stressors. The bread wheat cultivar Sonmez-2001 is a registered variety that is notable for its performance under low-irrigation conditions, which further improves upon irrigation. Additionally, Sonmez-2001 is resilient against certain biotic stressors, particularly soil-borne pathogens. Here, we provide a reference-guided whole genome sequence of Sonmez-2001, assembled into 21 chromosomes of the A, B and D genomes and totaling 13.3 gigabase-pairs in length. Additionally, a de novo assembly of an additional 1.05 gigabase-pairs was generated that represents either Sonmez-specific sequences or sequences that considerably diverged between Sonmez and Chinese Spring. Within this de novo assembly, we identified 35 gene models, of which 11 were high-confidence, that may contribute to the favorable traits of this high-performing variety. We identified up to 24 million sequence variants, of which up to 2.4% reside in coding sequences, that can be used to develop molecular markers that should be of immediate use to the cereal community.

                Background: Bionic hand prosthesis helps restore the original hand function. A survey on prosthetic users concluded that 79% thought that their devices were "too heavy". Therefore, the weight of the prosthesis is a major cause of user discomfort and fatigue. This research was aimed at the reduction of hand mass bionic prosthesis by optimizing the structure of the fingers with generative design methods.  Methods: The materials used were Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic and Nylon 6, and the manufacturing method used Additive Manufacturing. The prosthesis was designed with a lighter finger structure with a max displacement of 2 mm and a maximum safety factor of 4.  Results: Generative design produced more than 80 designs. The selection of the best design was based on the status of design solutions, research limitations, visual aesthetics, recommendation values, and validation of mechanical performances.  The best is the SS-2. This design has an 80% lighter mass with the highest safety factor of 3.79, the lowest stress of 5.26 MPa, and the maximum displacement of 0.61 mm.  Conclusion: Based on the exploration scheme, the generative design could produce more than 80 design solutions. The selection of the best design was based on the status of design solutions, research limitations, visual aesthetics, recommendation values, and validation of mechanical performances in the design. Design validation was carried out by simulating finite element analysis with static stress study methods in selected design candidates with input study cases similar to generative design exploration schemes. Finally, SS – 2 design was the best design produced by the generative design method with the highest factor of safety value of 3.79.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainable development of smart cities and smart territories based on the model of minimizing externalities [version 2; peer review: 3 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The development of conceptual models of a digital city poses numerous challenges for developers. The public sector concept model has become one of the most difficult models to use. When developing algorithms to find a solution, the multidirectional interests of businesses and public institutions are combined. This type of model reflects the most acute and urgent problems faced by megapolises with regard to combining numerous localized services provided to the community in a limited territory. The administrations of both cities and regions (the scale of the smart territories) must make decisions concerning overcoming the barriers existing between the profits of commercial structures, the negative externalities generated by their activities, and the social benefits to the population in the territory under their control. It is necessary to solve this problem to achieve the effective management of enterprises belonging to the segment of long-term participants in various business activities, interacting with the surrounding social and business environment in a complex. This study takes into account the complex structures of the economic processes characteristic of megacities. The periodicity of economic processes is also taken into account. When choosing an optimization criterion, functions reflecting the level of internalization of responsibility for external effects were considered. The authors propose a mathematical model that can be used as part of the management decision support systems software, aiming at taking into account the externalities of a wide range of national, institutional, business, and social activities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Increasing Brain Gamma Activity Improves Episodic Memory and Restores Cholinergic Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess whether non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation at gamma-frequency (γ-tACS) applied over the precuneus can improve episodic memory and modulate cholinergic transmission by modulating cerebral rhythms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, crossover study, 60 AD patients underwent a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation including assessment of episodic memory and cholinergic transmission pre and post 60 minutes treatment with γ-tACS targeting the precuneus or sham tACS. In a subset of 10 patients, EEG analysis and individualized modelling of electric field distribution were carried out. Predictors to γ-tACS efficacy were evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant improvement in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL) test immediate recall (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and delayed recall scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) after γ-tACS but not after sham tACS. Face-name associations scores improved with γ-tACS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not after sham tACS. Short latency afferent inhibition, an indirect measure of cholinergic transmission, increased only after γ-tACS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <i>ApoE</i> genotype and baseline cognitive impairment were the best predictors of response to γ-tACS. Clinical improvement correlated with the increase in gamma frequencies in posterior regions and with the amount of predicted electric field distribution in the precuneus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Precuneus γ-tACS, able to increase γ-power activity on the posterior brain regions, showed a significant improvement of episodic memory performances, along with restoration of intracortical excitability measures of cholinergic transmission. Response to γ-tACS was dependent on genetic factors and disease stage. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate, and incidence, and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women, with the strict clinicopathological definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men, by December 31, 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4 years with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with a mean survival of 14 years from symptom onset. Survival rates from both diagnosis date and symptom onset were decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Prefrontal cortex supports speech perception in listeners with cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in people with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing, specifically in a region engaged in a separate spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment of the left prefrontal cortex.
