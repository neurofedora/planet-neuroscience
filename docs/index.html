   href="http://wileyonlinelibrary.com">wileyonlinelibrary.com</a>), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editor-in-Chief, Lawrence S. Sherman, and Wiley Periodicals LLC. The retraction has been agreed upon following an investigation into concerns raised by a third party. The article purports a homology between amino acid sequences of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and the rubella virus E2 glycoprotein. However, further analysis has demonstrated that the referenced sequences are not present in the mature MOG proteins. The authors did not respond to address the concerns and did not provide their original data. As a result, the editors consider the conclusions of this article to be unsupported.</p>

                <p>Behavioral neuroscience research often requires substantial financial investment in specialized equipment and software, creating barriers for new investigators and limiting the flexibility of established laboratories. This study explores how 3D printing and machine learning can be combined to reduce startup and operational costs while maintaining research quality. Using 3D printing, we designed and manufactured a mouse T-maze and elevated plus maze to assess cognition and anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. These custom-built mazes demonstrated comparable efficacy with commercial alternatives while offering greater affordability, scalability, and customization. To complement the hardware, we integrated machine learning for automated tracking and analysis of mouse behavior, achieving accuracy equivalent to commercial solutions or experienced human scoring at significantly reduced cost. By combining 3D printing with machine learning, our approach significantly lowers financial barriers for new investigators and enables established research groups to allocate resources more effectively. This approach not only expands research possibilities for established labs but also lowers the barrier to entry for early-career scientists and institutions with limited funding.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/9/ENEURO.0153-25.2025?rss=1">Spatial Attention Weakly Modulates Visual Responses in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual responses in the cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced perception near the center of attention at the cost of perception at other locations. Information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of spatial attention on spiking activity in macaque LGN (one male, one female) and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention toward the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared with when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1 vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak, inconsistent, and restricted to a small subset of parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/9/ENEURO.0172-25.2025?rss=1">Treatment of Mitochondrial Disturbances due to Early Life Adversity in Mice Results in Restoration of Complex I Activity and Normal Reward Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The environment experienced by children, such as exposure to chronic early life adversity (ELA), increases lifespan brain disorder risk. The mechanisms that link ELA exposure to functional brain disruptions are not well understood. A limited-bedding and nesting paradigm, in which ELA is induced in mouse pups over the first postnatal week through disruption of maternal care, is characterized by limited resources, environment unpredictability, and disruption of reward and cognitive behaviors. Studies using this model demonstrated sex-selective alterations in hippocampal mitochondrial-associated proteins in response to ELA compared with care as usual (CAU). Further, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and complex I activity are increased in ELA juveniles, yet decreased in adults, with the impact of ELA moderated by sex in adults. Given that altered mitochondrial function is a key mediator in metabolic adaptations, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of reversing mitochondrial dysfunction and the anhedonia that accompanies ELA by addressing oxidative stress. Treatment with the antioxidant MitoQ began at weaning and extended to 3&nbsp;months. Measures of complex I activity demonstrated full recovery in adults. Female-specific deficits in the sucrose preference task, which is a measure of rewarding behavior in rodents, also exhibited recovery, with preference for sucrose comparable with that of CAU mice. These data indicate that mitochondrial health is one component of responses to early life adversity that has lifespan implications, but with the capacity to recover normal functioning in adults.</p>

                <p>by Yichao Liu, Peter Fransson, Julian Heidecke, Prasad Liyanage, Jonas Wallin, Joacim Rocklöv</p>

A majority of all infectious diseases manifest some climate-sensitivity. However, many of those sensitivities are not well understood as meteorological drivers of infectious diseases co-occur with other drivers exhibiting complex non-linear influences and feedback. This makes it hard to dissect their individual contributions. Here we apply a novel deep learning Explainable AI (XAI) compartment model with covariate drivers and dynamic feedback to predict and explain the dengue incidence across Sri Lanka. We compare the compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to a deep learning model without a compartmental structure. We find that the covariate compartmental hybrid model performs better and can describe drivers of the dengue spatiotemporal incidence over time. The strongest drivers in our model in order of importance are precipitation, socio-demographics, and normalized vegetation index. The novel method demonstrated can be used to leverage known infectious disease dynamics while accounting for the influence of other drivers and different population immunity contexts. While allowing for interpretation of the covariate driver influences, the approach bridges the gap between dynamical compartmental and data driven dynamical models.

The spread of infectious diseases is shaped by spatial and temporal aspects, such as host population structure or changes in the transmission rate or number of infected individuals over time. These spatiotemporal dynamics are imprinted in the genomes of pathogens and can be recovered from those genomes using phylodynamics methods. However, phylodynamic methods typically quantify either the temporal or spatial transmission dynamics, which leads to unclear biases, as one can potentially not be inferred without the other. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a structured coalescent skyline approach, MASCOT-Skyline, that allows us to jointly infer spatial and temporal transmission dynamics of infectious diseases using Markov chain Monte Carlo inference. To do so, we model the effective population size dynamics in different locations using a non-parametric function, allowing us to approximate a range of population size dynamics. We show, using a range of different viral outbreak datasets, potential issues with phylogeographic methods. We then use these viral datasets to motivate simulations of outbreaks that illuminate the nature of biases present in the different phylogeographic methods. We show that spatial and temporal dynamics should be modeled jointly, even if one seeks to recover just one of the two. Further, we showcase conditions under which we can expect phylogeographic analyses to be biased, particularly different subsampling approaches, as well as provide recommendations on when we can expect them to perform well. We implemented MASCOT-Skyline as part of the open-source software package MASCOT for the Bayesian phylodynamics platform BEAST2.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012872">Dual process impairments in reinforcement learning and working memory systems underlie learning deficits in physiological anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer D. Senta, Sonia J. Bishop, Anne G.E. Collins</p>

Anxiety has been robustly linked to deficits in frontal executive function including working memory (WM) and attentional control processes. However, although anxiety has also been associated with impaired performance on learning tasks, computational investigations of reinforcement learning (RL) impairment in anxiety have yielded mixed results. WM processes are known to contribute to learning behavior in parallel to RL processes and to modulate the effective learning rate as a function of load. However, WM processes have typically not been modeled in investigations of anxiety and RL. In the current study, we leveraged an experimental paradigm (RLWM) which manipulates the relative contributions of WM and RL processes in a reinforcement learning and retention task using multiple stimulus set sizes. Using a computational model of interactive RL and WM processes, we investigated whether individual differences in physiological or cognitive anxiety impacted task performance via deficits in RL or WM. Elevated physiological, but not cognitive, anxiety scores were strongly associated with worse performance during learning and retention testing across all set sizes. Computationally, higher physiological anxiety scores were significantly related to reduced learning rate and increased rate of WM decay. To highlight the importance of modeling WM contributions to learning, we considered the effect of fitting RL models without WM modules to the data. Here we found that reduced learning performance for higher physiological anxiety was at least partially misattributed to stochastic decision noise in 9 out of 10 RL-only models considered. These findings reveal a dual-process impairment in learning in anxiety that is linked to a more physiological than cognitive anxiety phenotype. More broadly, this work also points to the importance of accounting for the contribution of WM to RL when investigating psychopathology-related deficits in learning.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003404">Maternal food-derived signals oscillate in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus before its circadian clock develops</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Martin Sládek, Pavel Houdek, Tomáš Čajka, Alena Sumová</p>

The ontogenesis of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and its sensitivity to maternal signals are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the development of the clock in the rat SCN from the fetal to the postweaning period and identified rhythmic metabolic signals from the mother to the fetal SCN. We determined daily expression profiles of clock genes (<i>Per2</i>, <i>Nr1d1</i>, <i>Bmal1</i>) and clock- and metabolism-related genes (<i>Dbp</i>, <i>E4bp4</i>) and performed time-resolved analysis of the metabolome and lipidome in the SCN and plasma of 19-day-old embryos (E19) and 2-, 10-, 20-, and 28-day-old pups (P02–28). Our data show that rhythms in the expression of canonical clock genes are absent at E19 and develop gradually until P10, but the <i>Dbp</i> rhythm was still developing between P20 and P28. Expression of the metabolism-sensitive gene <i>E4bp4</i> and levels of essential amino acids and other metabolites supplied by maternal food are rhythmic in the fetal SCN, which is lost after birth at P02 and reappears later in the postnatal period. Maternal food-derived metabolites were also rhythmic in fetal plasma. The temporal coherence of the fetal SCN metabolome and lipidome declines markedly and its rhythmicity disappears immediately after birth. The results revealed previously unforeseen pathways by which the fetal SCN may receive rhythmic information from the mother before its clock develops.

                Du et al. demonstrate that task data alone can map the detailed organization of within-individual brain networks. Applications include reanalysis of existing data, pooling of task and resting-state data to increase statistical power, and studies that solely acquire task data to simultaneously estimate brain networks and extract the evoked response.

                Sun et al. use long-read sequencing data from high-grade serous ovarian cancer to perform de novo profiling of extrachromosomal DNA characteristics. They show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a multifunctional driver of genomic variations and tumor progression, including genomic instability, enhancer amplification, and transposon activation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100734">Spatial frequency adaptation modulates population receptive field sizes</a></h4>

              
                The spatial tuning of neuronal populations in the early visual cortical regions is related to the spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of neurons. However, there has been no direct investigation into how this relationship is reflected in population receptive field (pRF) sizes despite the common application of pRF mapping in visual neuroscience. We hypothesised that adaptation to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field sizes, resulting in a change in pRF sizes as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test this hypothesis, we first quantified the SF aftereffect using a psychophysical paradigm where human observers made SF judgments following adaptation to high/low SF noise patterns. We then incorporated the same adaptation technique into a standard pRF mapping procedure to investigate the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex following SF adaptation. Results showed that adaptation to a low/high SF resulted in smaller/larger pRFs, respectively, as hypothesised. Our results provide the most direct evidence to date that the spatial tuning of the visual cortex, as measured by pRF mapping, is related to the SF selectivity of visual neural populations. This has implications for various domains of visual processing, including size perception and visual acuity.

">Deep Learning-Based Control of Electrically Evoked Activity in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual cortical prostheses offer a promising path to sight restoration, but current systems elicit crude, variable percepts and rely on manual electrode-by-electrode calibration that does not scale. This work introduces an automated data-driven neural control method for a visual neuroprosthesis using a deep learning framework to generate optimal multi-electrode stimulation patterns that evoke targeted neural responses. Using a 96-channel Utah electrode array implanted in the occipital cortex of a blind participant, we trained a deep neural network to predict single-trial evoked responses. The network was used in two complementary control strategies: a learned inverse network for real-time stimulation synthesis and a gradient-based optimizer for precise targeting of desired neural responses. Both approaches significantly outperformed conventional methods in controlling neural activity, required lower stimulation currents, and adapted stimulation parameters to resting state data, reliably evoking more stable percepts. Crucially, recorded neural responses better predicted perceptual outcomes than stimulation parameters alone, underscoring the value of our neural population control framework. This work demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven neural control in a human implant and offers a foundation for next-generation, model-driven neuroprosthetic systems, capable of enhancing sensory restoration across a range of clinical applications.

">The alignment of respiration to sensory-motor events is shaped by expected effort.</a></h4>

              
                Humans often align their respiration with external events, a phenomenon thought to optimize neural resources for perception and action. Indeed, in sensory-cognitive experiments participants tend to align their respiration to the upcoming expected trials and their respiratory phase relates to neurophysiological processes reflecting changes in neural excitation, attention or arousal. However, it remains unclear whether this alignment is a passive entrainment to a task's overall rhythm or an active process selectively aligning respiration based on the demands of individual events. We here tested this by recording respiration during three visual discrimination experiments that manipulated trial importance by either imposing different response deadlines or by manipulating trial value and difficulty. Our results show that participants align their respiration more consistently around stimulus onset for trials with short deadlines or trials presenting high-value and high-difficulty. These findings demonstrate that respiratory alignment is dynamically modulated on a trial-by-trial basis according to the anticipated required effort or task demands. Hence we conclude that respiration serves as an active tool to strategically allocate cognitive resources for sensory-motor challenges.

">A multisensory, bidirectional, valence encoder guides behavioral decisions</a></h4>

              
                A key function of the brain is to categorize sensory cues as repulsive or attractive and respond accordingly. While we have some understanding of how sensory information is processed in the sensory periphery, the classification of cues according to valence in central brain circuits is less well understood. Here, we addressed this question in the Drosophila larva, where we could leverage the synaptic resolution connectome to determine where innate and learnt information from distinct aversive and appetitive sensory modalities converges; and combine this with imaging and manipulation of neural activity to determine how valence information is encoded and used to guide navigation. We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors. Together, our study reveals a neuron that bi-directionally encodes valence and controls actions.

">Effects of Cholesterol Modulation on Cisplatin-Induced Hearing Loss</a></h4>

              
                Cisplatin is a widely used and effective anticancer drug. However, it causes permanent sensorineural hearing loss in over 50% of treated patients. There are no FDA-approved therapies to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL) in adults, highlighting a critical unmet clinical need. Previous studies suggest that statins, commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, are associated with reduced incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Statins are primarily used to lower cholesterol, but they also exert several pleiotropic effects, making the mechanism(s) underlying this protection unclear. Here we examine whether reduced plasma cholesterol confers protection against CIHL independent of statin treatment. We utilized mice lacking serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9 knockout (KO) mice) as a genetic model of reduced plasma cholesterol. We find that Pcsk9 KO mice are protected against cisplatin-induced hearing loss, as reflected by significantly lower ABR and DPOAE threshold shifts relative to wild type (WT) mice following treatment. Histological analyses confirmed preservation of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) in Pcsk9 KO mice treated with cisplatin, whereas WT mice showed significant OHC loss in the high-frequency cochlear regions. Finally, hearing loss positively correlated with baseline plasma cholesterol levels. Together our data demonstrate that systemic cholesterol reduction provides significant protection against CIHL, and they suggest that the protective effect of statins against CIHL is mediated by cholesterol reduction.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The superficial white matter (SWM) comprises short-range fibers that connect adjacent cortical regions; however, its structural connectivity remains poorly understood. In a previous dissection study, we identified anatomical “crossings” where superficial white matter fibers converge from multiple directions. Building on this, the present study investigated superficial white matter characteristics associated with these crossings using diffusion-weighted imaging data from 10 individuals in the Human Connectome Project. A total of 605 regions of interest (ROIs) were placed at presumed crossing locations in the dominant hemisphere. Superficial white matter fibers were categorized by tract length (short, medium, and long), and streamline distribution was analyzed. Short- and medium-length fibers showed predominantly intragyral connections, while long fibers exhibited more diverse intragyral connectivity. Graph theoretical analysis identified high-efficiency regions of interest, putative hub regions, which were mapped onto cytoarchitectonic structures from the Economo-Koskinas atlas and compared with myelin concentration. High-efficiency regions for short- and middle-length fibers were mainly in primary motor and sensory areas, particularly visual regions, corresponding to high myelin concentration and cytoarchitectonic areas 1 and 5. In contrast, high-efficiency regions for long fibers were distributed in the association cortex (area 3). These findings provide new insights into the structural organization of superficial white matter and its relationship to cortical architecture.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding someone else’s attention lies at the heart of human interaction. When we perceive something to be in someone else’s attention, we understand it to be in that person’s mind in the moment, ready to affect that person’s choices. It has been proposed that people construct predictive models of the attentional state of others. In that proposal, a working understanding of someone else’s attention goes far beyond merely tracking the direction of someone’s eyes. For example, in a recent study, participants watched a spotlight of attention moving around a picture and successfully judged whether the trace represented real, human attention or an artificially manipulated version, demonstrating implicit information about how patterns of attention behave over space and time. However, the neuronal underpinnings of attention modeling are almost entirely unstudied. Here we tested people in an fMRI scanner while they performed the attention judgment paradigm. When contrasting attention traces that participants judged to be artificial versus those judged to be real, activity was found bilaterally in the precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and anterior insula, as well as in a part of the right temporoparietal junction. These areas partially overlap the theory-of-mind network and the salience network. The activations differ from those known to be involved in processing low-level features of attention such as the sight of other people’s eyes. The results provide an initial picture of the cortical networks involved in monitoring the attention patterns of others and recognizing when those patterns deviate from expectation.</span>

                <p>When compared with nature sounds, exposure to mechanical sounds evokes higher levels of perceptual and physiological arousal, prompting the recruitment of attentional and physiological resources to elicit adaptive responses. However, it is unclear whether these attributes are solely related to the sound intensity of mechanical sounds, since in most real-world scenarios, mechanical sounds are present at high intensities or if other acoustic or semantic factors are also at play. We measured the skin conductance response (SCR), reflecting sympathetic nervous system activity as well as the pleasantness and eventfulness of the soundscape across two passive and active listening tasks in healthy subjects (<I>N</I> = 25; 14 females, 11 males). The auditory stimuli were divided into two categories, nature and mechanical sounds, and were manipulated to vary in three perceived loudness levels. As expected, we found that the sound category influenced perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness. SCR was analyzed by taking the mean level across the stimulus epoch and also by quantifying its dynamics. We found that mean SCR was modulated by loudness only. SCR rise-time (a measure of the time it takes the skin response to increase from the baseline to its maximum value) correlated significantly with soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness for nature and mechanical sounds. This study highlights the importance of considering both the loudness level and sound category in evaluating the perceptual soundscape, and it identifies SCR as a valuable tool for such assessments.</p>

                <p>Rhythmic network states have been theorized to facilitate communication between brain regions, but how these oscillations influence communication subspaces, i.e., the low-dimensional neural activity patterns that mediate interregional communication, and in turn how subspaces impact behavior remain unclear. Using a spatial memory task in rats (male Long&ndash;Evans rats), we simultaneously recorded ensembles from hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to address this question. We found that task behaviors best aligned with low-dimensional, shared subspaces between these regions rather than local activity in either region. Critically, both network oscillations and speed modulated the structure and performance of this communication subspace. To understand the communication space, we visualized shared CA1&ndash;PFC communication geometry using manifold techniques and found ring-like structures. We hypothesize that these shared activity manifolds are utilized to mediate the task behavior. These findings suggest that memory-guided behaviors are driven by shared CA1&ndash;PFC interactions that are dynamically modulated by oscillatory states, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between rhythms and behaviorally relevant neural communication.</p>

Drug effects are difficult to investigate in detail <i>in vivo</i>. However, a mechanistic understanding of drug action is clearly beneficial for both pharmaceutical development as well as for optimization of treatment designs. We here established a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) mouse model which simultaneously describes whole-body pharmacokinetics of murine IFN-α as well as the cellular pharmacodynamic effect through the antiviral response biomarker Mx2. To this end, a dynamic model of intracellular IFN-α signalling in the JAK/STAT pathway was combined with a whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of IFN-α in mice. The pharmacodynamic behaviour of the resulting mouse IFN-α QSP model was first compared to a cellular model of the JAK/STAT pathway to compare <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> drug effects and to identify functional differences. It was found that the <i>in vitro</i> drug effect in the cellular model overestimates the <i>in vivo</i> response in mice at least by a factor of two which is partly due to the missing drug clearance <i>in vitro</i>. Also, the drug responses in the <i>in vitro</i> model were time delayed. Interspecies analyses in murine and a previously published human QSP model of IFN-α next show a similar dynamic behavior. However, our models demonstrate eight to 16-fold stronger response levels in mice than in humans due to more efficient interferon binding. Our analysis supports a mechanistic analysis of both upstream pharmacokinetic as well as downstream pharmacodynamic drug effects through the combination of physiological knowledge and quantitative computational models. The study hence shows potential applications for QSP modelling in terms of study planning, for example by choosing physiologically relevant in vitro concentrations. Also, the QSP model allows inter-species comparisons of the effect strength in specific functional readouts, which in humans are otherwise not possible due to the limited sampling possibilities. We expect QSP modelling to play an increasingly important role in drug development and research in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508">Mathematical modeling of dopamine rhythms and timing of dopamine reuptake inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tianyong Yao, Ruby Kim</p>

Dopamine (DA) plays a vital role in mood, alertness, and behavior, with dysregulation linked to disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, depression, and addiction. In this study, we develop and analyze a reduced mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake to investigate how daily rhythms influence dopamine dynamics and the efficacy of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) used in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions. We simplify a detailed mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake and demonstrate that our reduced system maintains key dynamical features including homeostatic regulation via autoreceptors. Our model captures core autoregulatory mechanisms and reveals that DRIs can exert substantial time-of-day effects, allowing for dopamine levels to be sustained at elevated levels when administered at circadian troughs. These fluctuations depend sensitively on the timing of DRI administration relative to circadian variations in enzyme activity. We further extend the model to incorporate feedback from local dopaminergic tone, which generates ultradian oscillations in the model independent of circadian regulation. Administration of DRIs lengthens the ultradian periodicity. Our findings provide strong evidence that intrinsic fluctuations in DA should be considered in the clinical use of DRIs, offering a mechanistic framework for improving chronotherapeutic strategies targeting dopaminergic dysfunction.

                <p>by Zhiqiang Ma, Ran Chen, Zibo Feng</p>
Background <p>Circulating proteins play a critical role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet few have been targeted therapeutically. This study aimed to identify novel protein targets for RA therapy.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian Randomization (MR), colocalization analysis, and summary-data-based MR (SMR) to explore potential causal relationships between plasma proteins and RA, with an overall sample size of 1,148,608. The GWAS data on plasma proteins were obtained from the FinnGen study, the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and Iceland GWAS data. Then, validation of key molecules’ differential expression pattern was done using external transcriptomic data from RA patients, while the Drug Signatures Database (DsigDB) was used to identify potential therapeutic drugs. Drugs and target proteins interactions was evaluated with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations approaches. Potential side effects of plasma proteins associated with RA were elucidated by phenome-wide association study (Phe-WAS) approach.</p> Results <p>Genetically predicted levels of 68 plasma proteins were associated with RA. After colocalization and SMR analysis, 6 plasma proteins (FCRL3, SUGP1, TNFAIP3, EHBP1, HAPLN4, and CILP2) have been passed all tests and identified as having potential as therapeutic targets for RA. Further Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis indicated that three protiens (CILP2, TNFAIP3 and EHBP) have a good potential as biomarkers for RA. Differential gene analysis showed the downregulation of HAPLN4, FCRL3, EHBP1 and TNFAIP3 in RA, as well as the upregulation of CILP2 in RA. Further Phe-WAS suggested that targeting these proteins may have potential side effects.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study investigated the causal relationships between plasma proteins and RA, deepening our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and facilitating the development of new therapeutic drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003418">Microsaccades strongly modulate but do not directly cause the EEG N2pc marker of spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Baiwei Liu, Siyang Kong, Freek van Ede</p>

The N2pc is a popular human-neuroscience marker of covert and internal spatial attention that occurs 200–300 ms after being prompted to shift attention—a time window also characterized by the spatial biasing of small fixational eye movements known as microsaccades. Here, we show how co-occurring microsaccades profoundly modulate N2pc amplitude during top-down shifts of spatial attention in both perception and working memory. At the same time, we show that a significant—albeit severely weakened—N2pc can still be established in the absence of co-occurring microsaccades. Moreover, despite the strong modulation of the N2pc by microsaccade presence and direction, the N2pc does not align to the precise timing of microsaccades, ruling out that the observed N2pc modulations by microsaccades are a direct artifact of microsaccade-related eye-muscle activity, corneo-retinal dipole movement, or visual inputs moving over the retina. Thus, while microsaccades strongly modulate N2pc amplitude, microsaccades themselves are not a prerequisite for, nor a direct cause of, the N2pc.

                <p>by Xianhui Liu, Yao D. Cai, Chunyan Hou, Xu Liu, Youcheng Luo, Aron Judd P. Mendiola, Xuehan Xu, Yige Luo, Haiyan Zheng, Caifeng Zhao, Ching-Hsuan Chen, Yong Zhang, Yang K. Xiang, Junfeng Ma, Joanna C. Chiu</p>

The liver circadian clock and hepatic transcriptome are highly responsive to metabolic signals generated from feeding–fasting rhythm. Previous studies have identified a number of nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways that could interpret metabolic input to regulate rhythmic hepatic biology. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification (PTM) in mediating metabolic regulation of rhythmic biology in the liver. We observe daily oscillation of global nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation in the liver of mice subjected to night-restricted feeding (NRF) using label-free global O-GlcNAc proteomics. Additional site-specific O-GlcNAc analysis by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry further supports temporal differences in O-GlcNAcylation by revealing day–night differences. Proteins involved in gene expression are enriched among rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated proteins, suggesting rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation may directly regulate the hepatic transcriptome. We show that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation can also indirectly modulate nuclear proteins by interacting with phosphorylation. Several proteins harboring O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interplay motif exhibit rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. Specifically, we show that O-GlcNAcylation occurs at a phospho-degron of a key circadian transcriptional activator, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), thus regulating its stability and transcriptional output. Finally, we report that day-restricted feeding (DRF) in the nocturnal mouse significantly alters O-GlcNAcylation pattern. Whereas global O-GlcNAcylation analysis indicates dampening of global O-GlcNAcylation rhythm in mice fed under DRF, site-specific analysis reveals differential responses of O-GlcNAc sites when timing of food intake is altered. Notably, a substantial number of O-GlcNAcylation sites exhibit inverted day–night profiles when mice are subjected to DRF. This suggests the dysregulation of daily nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation rhythm may contribute to the disruption in liver transcriptome previously observed in DRF condition. In summary, our results provide new mechanistic insights into metabolic regulation of hepatic transcriptional regulators via interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and shed light on the deleterious effects of improper mealtimes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003396">Cross‐species rescue reveals sequence requirements for a rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered region</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sang On Park, Rishad Khondker, Ariel Blank, Annie Dyatel, Corey Frazer, Richard J. Bennett, Robert J. Reid, Rodney J. Rothstein, Luke E. Berchowitz</p>

Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are essential for their function but do not adopt a stable structure; instead, they exist as an ensemble of conformations. Because these regions lack fixed structural constraints, traditional structure-based and alignment-based approaches are often ineffective for studying their sequence–function relationships. Here, we present an approach that combines molecular evolution with genetic complementation to extract functional sequence features of an IDR. We use the budding yeast RNA-binding protein Rim4 as a model system. Rim4 is required for sporulation, and its IDR facilitates its dual role as a translational activator and repressor. Notably, Rim4’s IDR supports assembly into an SDS-resistant amyloid-like form, which is required for its repressor function. We demonstrate that the Rim4 IDR is functionally conserved across orthologous sequences spanning more than 400 million years of evolution, despite extensive sequence divergence. Our results suggest that noncomplementing Rim4 IDRs generally evolve toward higher hydrophobicity, and that reducing hydrophobicity can refunctionalize a nonfunctional IDR sequence that diverged over 200 million years ago. In the refunctionalized IDR, the activator function is restored, whereas assembly into an amyloid-like form remains uncomplemented. Overall, our findings add to evidence that IDRs can perform multiple functions, with each role optimized by distinct biochemical properties, and that evolutionary pressure favoring one function may drive the IDR toward biochemical characteristics that compromise its other functions.

<p>Teles et al. propose a model of brain evolution that explains how come fish with larger bodies have larger brains with more neurons across cohorts raised in different growth conditions, while individuals within a cohort do not, mimicking the different findings across and within species, respectively.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Comparative work on brain size variation across vertebrates has shown that larger species have larger brains and that larger brains have more neurons across species in each clade. This trend supports the expectation that larger bodies require larger brains with more neurons but is at odds with the finding that within a species, larger animals do not necessarily have larger brains, and larger brains do not have more neurons. While the latter finding is inconsistent with the expectation that larger brained species evolve through selection of larger brained individuals, the lack of correlation between brain size and numbers of neurons across individuals of a same species might be due to the small range of variation that is typically found within a species. Here, we take advantage of ecologically regulated indeterminate growth exhibited by the cichlid fish tilapia (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>) raised under different population densities to generate an over 30-fold variation in body mass across adult individuals of the same age. We find that across the cohorts of individuals raised with different growth opportunities provided by different population densities, larger animals have larger brains with more neurons that occur at similar neuronal densities, as applies to interspecific scaling in several vertebrate clades. Within each cohort raised at a given population density, however, those animals with more neurons have higher neuronal densities, but not larger brains or bodies, though the latter scale together—as applies to intraspecific scaling in mice and chickens. We conclude that brain size and number of neurons are determined independently across individuals in a population but scale together across cohorts, in step changes that accompany varying opportunities for growth, in the absence of any selection pressure. Based on these results, we propose a model of brain evolution through plastic changes in response to changing environmental opportunities that accounts for intra-, inter-, and clade-specific patterns of brain scaling and diversity.</p>

                Ali et al. demonstrate that the neuropeptide ADM plays an important role in regulating GSC-macrophage symbiosis in GBM. EGFR-driven ADM promotes GSC self-renewal, macrophage infiltration, and pro-tumor reprogramming via the ADMR-STAT3/STAT6 pathway. Blocking this signaling axis disrupts the symbiosis and inhibits tumor growth in GBM mouse and PDX models.

                Newton et al. establish PERK as a copper-regulated kinase. The copper dependency of PERK kinase activity is characterized in vitro utilizing glutathione pull-down assays, kinase assays, and CETSA. The physiological implications of this regulatory paradigm for the modulation of ER stress tolerance are demonstrated in cellular and animal models.

                González-Pérez et al. developed an in vitro method to induce trained immunity using murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Standardization of training protocols using experimental mouse models is critical for advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate innate immune-memory responses and develop therapies that target trained macrophages under pathological conditions.

Quorum-sensing control in S. haemolyticus by the Agr system had a significant impact on the outcome of septic blood infection in mice, which was completely driven by production of phenol-soluble modulin toxins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100687">Steady-state neuron-predominant LINE-1 encoded ORF1p protein and LINE-1 RNA increase with aging in the mouse and human brain</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant, and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly, which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98624">Segment-specific axon guidance by Wnt/Fz signaling diversifies motor commands in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Functional diversification of homologous neuronal microcircuits is a widespread feature observed across brain regions, as well as across species, while its molecular and developmental mechanisms remain largely unknown. We address this question in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae by focusing on segmentally homologous Wave command-like neurons, which diversify their wiring and function in a segment-specific manner. Anterior Wave (a-Wave) neurons extend axons anteriorly and connect to circuits inducing backward locomotion, whereas posterior Wave (p-Wave) neurons extend axons posteriorly and trigger forward locomotion. Here, we show that Frizzled receptors DFz2 and DFz4, together with the DWnt4 ligand, regulate the segment-specific Wave axon projection. <i>DFz2</i> knockdown (KD) not only reroutes Wave axons to posterior neuromeres but also biases its motor command to induce forward instead of backward locomotion as tactile response. Thus, segment-specific axon guidance diversifies the function of homologous command neurons in behavioral regulation. Since control of anterior-posterior (A-P) axon guidance by Wnt/Fz signaling is evolutionarily conserved, our results reveal a potentially universal molecular principle for formation and diversification of the command system in the nerve cord. Furthermore, this work indicates that sensorimotor transduction can be rerouted by manipulating a single gene in a single class of neurons, potentially facilitating the evolutionary flexibility in action selection.

                Glutamatergic synapses form the vast majority of connections within neuronal circuits, but how these subcellular structures are molecularly organized within the mammalian brain is poorly understood. Conventional electron microscopy using chemically fixed, metal-stained tissue has identified a proteinaceous, membrane-associated thickening called the ‘postsynaptic density’ (PSD). Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh isolated and anatomically intact synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse did not consistently show a higher density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane, thought to be characteristic of the PSD. Instead, a ‘synaptoplasm’ consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes, and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into membrane remodeling processes. Clusters of up to 60 ionotropic glutamate receptors were positioned inside and outside the synaptic cleft. Together, these information-rich tomographic maps present a detailed molecular framework for the coordinated activity of synapses in the adult mammalian brain.

                This study investigated 17α-estradiol’s effects on aged hypothalamic physiological activity via long-term administration. Single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on pooled hypothalami from each group: aged male Norway brown rats treated with 17α-estradiol (O.T), aged controls (O), and young controls (Y). Supervised clustering of neurons (based on neuropeptides/receptors) evaluated subtype responses to aging and 17α-estradiol. Aging-induced elevation of neuronal cellular metabolism, stress, and reduced synapse formation-related pathways were significantly attenuated by 17α-estradiol. Neuron population analysis showed that subtypes regulating food intake, reproduction, blood pressure, stress response, and electrolyte balance were sensitive to 17α-estradiol. 17α-estradiol increased serum oxytocin (Oxt) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis activity (elevated plasma Gnrh, total testosterone; reduced estradiol). Gnrh1 upregulation mediated its effects on energy homeostasis, neural synapse, and stress response. Notably, <i>Crh</i> neurons in O.T showed prominent stress phenotypes, distinct from <i>Agrp/Ghrl</i> neurons. Thus, HPG axis and energy metabolism may be key 17α-estradiol targets in male hypothalamus. Additionally, our results demonstrate that supervised clustering (based on neuropeptides/receptors) effectively assesses the responses of hypothalamic neuron subtypes to aging and 17α-estradiol treatment.

">Context-dependent presynaptic inhibition of somatostatin interneuron inputs to Layer 1 of the visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Layer 1 of the cortex is a critical site for integrating top-down inputs onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where inhibitory neurons modulate these inputs to enable context-dependent sensory processing. Yet, it remains unclear how behavioral context dynamically regulates inhibition in Layer 1. We discover a circuit motif in which NDNF cortical interneurons (cINs) presynaptically inhibit the axonal outputs of somatostatin (SST) cINs in Layer 1 of the visual cortex. Using combinatorial genetics, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, super-resolution imaging, optogenetics, slice electrophysiology, and in vivo calcium imaging, we show that NDNF cINs form direct contacts onto SST axons and suppress their output, thereby modulating inhibitory responses in L2/3 pyramidal neurons. This presynaptic inhibitory circuit is preferentially engaged during locomotion and low-contrast visual conditions. By dynamically modulating Layer 1-mediated inhibitory output onto pyramidal neurons, this circuit motif enables context-dependent modulation of visual processing.

">The functional organization of retrosplenial feedback to V1</a></h4>

              
                Cortical feedback from higher frontal and association areas to early sensory cortex is thought to contribute to a range of cognitive processes in which sensory signals are processed in a context sensitive manner. Despite the ubiquity of feedback circuitry in the cortex, the information carried by feedback connections, and the principles governing how it is targeted from area to area remains poorly understood. Here we characterized the functional properties of a prominent feedback circuit which links retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and primary visual cortex (V1). We found that RSC>V1 axons relay retinotopically selective signals to V1 which at a coarse scale match the region of the V1 retinotopic map innervated, were tuned for spatial and temporal frequency, but not tuned for orientation. Two-color imaging of RSC>V1 boutons and local L2/3 V1 neurons further revealed that at a finer scale RSC>V1 bouton receptive fields are systematically offset relative to those of V1 in the nasal direction, consistent with RSC>V1 boutons conveying signals predictive of upcoming V1 activity in the retinotopic region innervated during forward movement.

">CS - plasticity and behavioral-state integration in the posterior insula during auditory fear learning</a></h4>

              
                During fear learning, animals learn to associate sensory cues (conditioned stimulus, CS) with aversive outcomes, and neurons in several brain areas become entrained to the CS. The posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) contains representations of internal states and sensory cues, amongst them auditory stimuli. Nevertheless, the possibility of plastic encoding of auditory responses in the pInsCx during fear learning, and its underlying synaptic mechanisms have not been addressed. Using single-unit recordings in the pInsCx of male mice during fear learning, we find that ~ 10% of putative principal neurons acquire a response to an auditory CS during fear learning ("CS learners"). CS learners are enriched in the insula auditory field (IAF) of the dorsal pInsCx, and strongly overlap with a larger neuronal subpopulation which increases its activity during movement initiation. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we find that the IAF receives glutamatergic synapses from the non-lemniscal auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex (A1); fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at the cortical, but not at the thalamic input synapse. Combined single-unit recordings and optogenetic axon silencing showed that the acquired CS-response during fear recall depends on transmission at the A1 [-&gt;] pInsCx synapse. Our study shows that the pInsCx generates a plastic representation of an auditory CS during fear learning, driven by LTP of an associative cortical input. Future work should further investigate how the integration of CS- and movement information in the insula contributes to the expression of auditory-cued fear memories.

">Brain-wide representational drift: memory consolidation and entropic force</a></h4>

              
                Memory engrams change on the microscopic level with time and experience as the neurons that compose them switch in a process termed representational drift. On the macroscopic level the engrams are not static either: numbers of engram neurons in different brain regions change over time, which is considered to reflect the process of memory consolidation. Here we predict a link between these two levels, using a novel statistical physics approach to engram modeling. Importantly, it is general as it makes only minimal assumptions on the engram's nature, does not rely on a specific architecture, and its fundamental implications hold for any representational drift with random component. Our first, analytically well tractable model shows that an entropic force emerges at the region level from random representational drift at the neuronal level. We refine the model by incorporating the interaction of the entropic force with biological processes that shape neuronal engrams. Here, the connectivity between the brain regions strongly influences the (quasi-)equilibrium engram distribution. The obtained distributions are in qualitative agreement with the ones of a biologically detailed drifting assembly model. Our engram description allows to predict the engram evolution in large neuronal systems such as the mouse brain. We find several predictions that are consistent across the valid tested parameter ranges, such as a strong tendency of the engram to leave the hippocampus. The results suggest that the brain operates in a regime where engrams drift, both deterministically and randomly, to allow for memory consolidation.

                Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are dynamic, membraneless organelles that sequester translationally repressed mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of localized protein synthesis. While disassembly of RNP granules is essential for reactivating translation, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity regulates this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) triggers calcium influx, leading to activation of calpain 1 and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a core component of stress granules. This cleavage results in the disassembly of G3BP1 granules in the neurites and promotes mTOR-dependent local translation, thereby linking synaptic activity to spatially restricted protein synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that the NMDAR-calpain 1-G3BP1-mTOR signaling axis contributes to axonal regeneration, establishing proteolytic remodeling of RNP granules as a key mechanism of activity-dependent neural repair, with potential implications for therapeutic intervention in brain injury.

">A specialized cold sensing system in the naked mole-rat</a></h4>

              
                Avoiding cold or seeking warmth are universal animal needs. Homeothermic mammals maintain a constant body temperature despite fluctuating ambient temperatures. One exception is the naked mole-rat which lacks effective thermogenesis. We show that the naked mole-rat has evolved a greatly expanded cold sensing system. Compared to mice, this species has many more cold-sensitive sensory neurons and most express the cold-activated TRPM8 channel. The naked mole-rat TrpM8 gene harbors a unique upstream exon that when translated produces a TRPM8 protein with a 71 amino acid N-terminal extension. When expressed, the N-terminal extension prevents membrane targeting and abolishes TRPM8 function. Splice forms lacking the extension formed functional cold and menthol activated channels in vivo. Additionally, many naked mole-rat sensory neurons use a TRPM8-independent mechanism to detect cold. Thus, we identified molecular changes that confer both sensitivity and flexibility to cold sensing in a species that is critically dependent on following thermal cues.

">Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling in COVID-19 positive patients reveals alterations in pathways linked to neurological dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA betacoronavirus, causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a broad spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to a severe, deadly illness. Emerging evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 affects host gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, potentially contributing to immune dysregulation and post-acute sequelae, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the extent and functional relevance of these epigenetic changes remain uncertain. Methods and results We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in peripheral blood from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients across a spectrum of symptom severity, ranging from asymptomatic to severe (n=101), in comparison to SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals (n=105). We observed a widespread hypomethylation in the genomes of infected individuals, which was more pronounced in severe cases. Notably, we identified differentially methylated genes in patients with mild (19 genes), moderate (19 genes), and severe (35 genes) symptoms. These genes included those involved in canonical immune responses as well as known to be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis further supported the significant association between the differentially methylated genes and those implicated in Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, as well as neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting potential epigenetic links between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-term neurological outcomes. This is one of the first studies to comprehensively map severity-stratified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Our findings underscore the potential importance of epigenetic regulation in the acute responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight an overlap with epigenetic mechanisms relevant for neuropsychiatric disease processes.

">High-Fidelity Neural Speech Reconstruction through an Efficient Acoustic-Linguistic Dual-Pathway Framework</a></h4>

              
                Reconstructing speech from neural recordings is crucial for understanding speech coding and developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, existing methods trade off acoustic richness (pitch, prosody) for linguistic intelligibility (words, phonemes). To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-path framework to concurrently decode acoustic and linguistic representations. The acoustic pathway uses a long-short term memory (LSTM) decoder and a high-fidelity generative adversarial network (HiFi-GAN) to reconstruct spectrotemporal features. The linguistic pathway employs a transformer adaptor and text-to-speech (TTS) generator for word tokens. These two pathways merge via voice cloning to combine both acoustic and linguistic validity. Using only 20 minutes of electrocorticography (ECoG) data per subject, our approach achieves highly intelligible synthesized speech (mean opinion score = 4.0/5.0, word error rate = 18.9%). Our dual-path framework reconstructs natural and intelligible speech from ECoG, resolving the acoustic-linguistic trade-off.

">Changing the Motivation for Mental Work with Temporal Interference Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Successful goal-directed behavior often requires the exertion of effortful control processes. The striatum is thought to play a key role in determining whether a goal is worth the required cognitive effort, but whether and how the striatum causally influences effort-based decisions in humans remained unclear. Here, we address this gap by employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique capable of targeting deeper brain regions. We applied striatum-targeted tTIS to healthy participants performing an effort-based decision task during functional MRI scanning. Supporting the idea that the striatum encodes both the benefits and costs of actions, we found that, on the behavioral level, striatum-targeted tTIS increased the sensitivity to both reward magnitudes and effort costs. At the neural level, this was mirrored by stronger representations of effort demands in the striatum under stimulation as well as by enhanced functional coupling between the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex, a region at the intersection of motivation and cognition. Together, our findings provide insights into the causal contributions of the striatum to trading-off rewards against effort costs, informing neural accounts of motivated cognition and suggesting novel neural interventions for the treatment of amotivation.

">Peripheral nerve-targeting and pain-promoting transcriptomic signatures in early Guillain-Barr&eacute syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Guillain-Barr&eacute syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness, sensory loss, autonomic dysfunction, and chronic neuropathic pain. The mediators responsible for driving early autoimmune injury in the most common GBS variant, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), remain incompletely understood. We performed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from early untreated AIDP-variant GBS patients and healthy controls to comprehensively deduce leukocyte transcriptome alterations and predict disease-driving interactions between pathogenic leukocytes and peripheral nervous system cells. Bulk transcriptomics showed interferon- and JAK/STAT-driven proinflammatory signatures in myeloid cells. CD8+ T-cells were highly proliferative and expressed axon guidance genes. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed dysregulation of CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory and CD4+ effector memory T-cells indicative of poorly controlled type 1 and type 17 immune responses. Highly activated intermediate monocytes upregulated genes related to angiogenesis and oncostatin M. Interactome analysis between GBS leukocytes, Schwann cells, and sensory neurons predicted increased engagement of ligand-receptor pairs with nerve integrity and pain functions, including epiregulin, interferon-beta, adrenomedullin, clusterin, IL-6, IL-15, and CCL4. Functional validation demonstrated that CCL4 sensitizes human sensory neurons in vitro. These results unearth molecular interactions by which specific leukocyte populations in AIDP-variant GBS may induce peripheral nerve injury and drive neuropathic pain.

">RHO1-2 meganuclease gene editing targets human P23H rhodopsin-induced retinitis pigmentosa to rejuvenate rods and maintain cones</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive vision loss and eventual blindness. The P23H mutation (proline to histidine substitution at codon 23) in the rhodopsin (RHO) gene represents the most common form of adRP in North Americans. Currently, there is no cure for P23H adRP. Genome editing targeting the mutant RHO allele, leaving a functional wildtype (WT) allele, is an attractive approach for P23H adRP, as only one copy of RHO is needed for normal retinal function. We re-engineered an I-Cre meganuclease, called RHO1-2, to target a 22bp recognition sequence encompassing the mutation responsible for the p.P23H RHO mutation. In vitro, RHO1-2, cuts human P23H RHO but not WT RHO. In vivo, we delivered scAAV5:GRK1:RHO1-2 via subretinal injection in early-stage degeneration using the only large animal model of human p.P23H RHO adRP (TgP23H pigs). We tested RHO1-2 efficacy and durability, on retinal function using full-field electroretinograms and on retinal structure using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and immunohistochemistry. We observe that RHO1-2 treatment: arrests rod photoreceptor degeneration, resurrects rod-driven retinal function that does not exist in untreated TgP23H pigs, restores mislocalized rhodopsin expression and rebuilds rod inner and outer segments (IS/OS). Rod rescue maintains cones. A year after RHO1-2 treatment, we show that TgP23H pigs use rod-driven vision to navigate a maze. Our results demonstrate that genome editing via RHO1-2 meganuclease is a viable treatment to cure human p.P23H RHO adRP. They also suggest that meganuclease-based editors can be effective for other IRDs.

">Whole-Brain Models of Minimal Phenomenal Experience: Approaching Criticality through Jhana Meditation</a></h4>

              
                Minimal phenomenal experiences (MPE) provide a distinctive entry point for investigating consciousness and understanding how certain meditative practices may represent and contribute to human flourishing. Adopting a neurophenomenological stance, we combine first-person phenomenology with formal whole-brain modeling to ask what mechanisms underlie MPE states and the progression towards it, as reached through jh[a]na meditation, a type of advanced concentrative absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We used a dataset of advanced practitioners performing the eight ACAM-J states scanned in high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each state, we build a mechanistic whole-brain model that reproduces brain activity by modeling the dynamical regimes of different resting-state networks. We found that the later ACAM-J states, taken here as candidates for MPE, show a shift of functional network dynamics toward near-bifurcation working points. The default mode network exhibits the largest shift, from a distant noise-driven regime at a control condition to near-critical dynamics. We also observed that the pathway to MPE is non-linear, with prominent reconfigurations at key meditative milestones. Our results suggest that MPE corresponds to a globally susceptible state where near-critical dynamics dominate. We interpret this critical regime as a form of "openness", where the usual hierarchical and heterogeneous patterns of brain activity give way to generalized flexibility. In this light, MPE provides both a minimal model of consciousness and a window into how advanced meditation can profoundly reshape brain dynamics.

">Vision dominates sound in mediating classic cue-induced microsaccadic eye movement modulations in rhesus macaque monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Visual onsets in the environment cause a short-latency reduction in saccade generation likelihood. Concomitant with that, the metrics of the saccades that do happen near the time of saccadic inhibition reflect the landscape of stimulus-driven neural responses in topographically organized brain maps. While certain aspects of saccadic inhibition have already been explored from a neurophysiological perspective, several questions remain, including which sensory-motor pathways propagate visual input information to the final oculomotor control circuitry with such short latencies. Here, motivated by evidence of a dissociation between temporal and spatial aspects of saccadic inhibition, we devised behavioral paradigms experimentally manipulating either aspect. Rhesus macaque monkeys maintained gaze fixation, and we characterized visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition with and without paired auditory pulses. In one condition, the sound pulses were spatially-unbiased, thus only affecting the temporal processes associated with microsaccadic inhibition; in another, the pulses were spatially-biased, affecting both the temporal and spatial components. We found that sound pulses alone barely affected microsaccade rates. However, when paired with visual stimuli, they accelerated the timing of visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition by ~14-18 ms. In terms of microsaccade directions, spatially-unbiased sounds interfered with, but did not eliminate, visually-driven direction modulations. Surprisingly, spatially-biased sounds had a much weaker effect on microsaccade direction modulations, even when the sound source was in the opposite hemifield as the appearing visual stimulus. We conclude that vision dominates sound in mediating classic microsaccadic inhibition, and we argue that our paradigms are ideal for neurophysiological investigations of the parallel sensory-motor pathways contributing to such inhibition.

">Aβ Antibodies Target Not Only Amyloid Plaques But Also Distinct Brain Cells And Vessels</a></h4>

              
                Background: Antibodies against amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) are the only therapies capable of slowing cognitive decline and reducing A{beta} plaque burden in Alzheimer disease (AD). Yet the precise sites where antibodies engage A{beta} in the brain, and the mechanisms that drive A{beta} clearance, are not fully defined. Defining the A{beta} antibody engagement with A{beta} in brain is essential to understand how immunotherapy can be beneficial for AD. Methods: We administered the well-establsihed N-terminal A{beta} antibody 6E10 via intrahippocampal (IH), cisterna magna (CM), or intraperitoneal (IP) injection in AD mouse models. N-terminal A{beta} antibodies were seen as most effective in AD mouse models. Antibody 6E10 was not only assessed in A{beta} plaques, but also examined in association with diverse brain cells and vascular compartments. Glymphatic dynamics were evaluated following A{beta} antibody treatment. Results: As expected, A{beta} antibody 6E10 bound to A{beta} plaques but remarkably also localized to vulnerable neurons, such as hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, as well as microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, perivascular macrophages (PVMs), and blood vessels. Glymphatic function showed no significant alterations after antibody administration. Conclusions: A{beta} antibodies distribute not only to amyloid plaques but also to neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels. This study provides detailed localizations of antibody in the AD brain, offering valuable insights into cellular targets and spatial dynamics of A{beta} antibody-based immunotherapy.

">The turbulent brain: Modelling vortex interactions for understanding human cognition</a></h4>

              
                The human brain needs distributed, time-critical computation to efficiently solve complex problems. Turbulence provides such highly efficient spacetime information processing and transmission across wide-spread brain networks, yet we have been missing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of turbulent vortices underlying human cognition. Here, we build the first whole-brain model of turbulent vortices as defined by the levels of local synchronisation in brain signals quantifying turbulent interactions in vortex space. Specifically, using large-scale human neuroimaging data, we found that the interactions of turbulent vortices is an excellent framework for understanding cognition and brain computation. It is not only useful for distinguishing the detailed spacetime dynamics of rest and cognition - but can even distinguish between subtle sub-components of cognitive tasks, where manipulation of vortices can be shown to change cognition. Overall, this whole-brain framework creates a natural vortex space for the brain computation underlying cognition, as well as potentially providing novel ways of controlling turbulent interactions in disease.

">A dNmnat-sensitized in vivo platform for unbiased discovery of regulators of neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration drives nervous system dysfunction in diverse neurological diseases and injuries. While key regulators of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration have been identified, approaches have largely relied on axotomy, a particularly extreme injury for a neuron. Here, we developed a forward genetic screening platform in the adult Drosophila wing that sensitizes neurons to degeneration through depletion of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (dNmnat), the essential NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We screened 9,393 mutagenized chromosomes and recovered 59 mutations that suppress neurodegeneration induced by dNmant depletion, including the known pro-degenerative molecule dSarm, thereby validating our approach. We show loss of CG4098, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian enzyme NUDT9, robustly preserved axons and induced widespread remodeling of NAD-related metabolites, which provides a new link between cADP-ribose hydrolase activity and neuronal survival. We further show mutations in the transcription factor Abrupt resulted in elevated dNmnat protein levels and blocked axon degeneration, suggesting Abrupt normally tunes dNmnat levels and neuronal NAD homeostasis. dNmnat depletion is thus a versatile approach for unbiased discovery of axon death pathway components, each of which may provide new entry points for therapeutic strategies to preserve axons in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Exponential Map Models as an Interpretable Framework for Generating Neural Spatial Representations</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI is understanding how physical space is mapped into neural representations. While artificial neural networks can generate brain-like spatial representations, such as place and grid cells, their black-box nature makes it difficult to determine if these representations arise as general solutions or as artifacts of a chosen architecture, objective function, or training protocol. Critically, these models offer no guarantee that learned solutions for core navigational tasks, like path integration (updating position from self-motion), will generalize beyond their training data. To address these challenges, we introduce a first-principles framework based on an exponential map model. Instead of using deep networks or gradient optimization, the presented model uses generator matrices to map physical locations into neural representations through the matrix exponential, creating a transparent framework that allows us to identify several exact algebraic conditions underlying key properties of neural maps. We show that path invariance (ensuring location representations are independent of traversal route) is achieved if the generators commute, while translational invariance (maintaining consistent spatial relationships across locations) demands generators producing orthogonal transformations. We also show that preserving the metric of flat space requires the eigenvalues of the generator matrices to form sets of roots of unity. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework constructs diverse biologically relevant spatial tuning, including place cells, grid cells, and context-dependent remapping. The framework we propose thus offers a transparent, theoretically-grounded alternative to black-box models, revealing the exact conditions required for a coherent neural map of space.

">Integrative analysis reveals generalizable human neurodegenerative disease-associated glial states</a></h4>

              
                Disease-associated glia represent plastic transcriptional cellular states observed across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). In particular, microglial states have been characterized in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of amyloidosis. Although single-cell transcriptomic technologies have increased the dimensionality of information available across cell states, few studies have systematically tested for changes in glial transcription across brain regions and disease states. Here, we report a statistical framework for glial annotation, disease association, and transcriptional profiling, which facilitate identification of generalizable glial states that are present across a spectrum of NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal dementia). We identify seven astrocyte substates, 14 microglia/myeloid substates, and five oligodendrocyte substates where transcriptional variability is attributable to region, disease, or batch effects. Regional heterogeneity of astrocytes masked disease associations, even within cortical astrocytes. We found only limited oligodendrocyte transcriptional heterogeneity, resulting in few substates for further interrogation. Notably, microglia showed the strongest evidence for disease association. We show, for the first time, that this association exists across the entire NDD spectrum. Using latent factor analysis, we created a consensus human neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia (hnDAM) signature, which we experimentally validated in 11 independent sample series. We demonstrate that the hnDAM signature is a statistically testable biomarker for conserved microglial activation in NDDs by: i) comparing to murine DAM-like signatures, ii) performing transcription factor analysis, and iii) modeling transcriptional reprogramming perturbations in iPSC-derived microglia. Taken together, this work broadens our understanding of glial activation across neuropathologies and reveals hnDAM as a putative therapeutic target that can be widely generalized to patients suffering from NDDs.

">From Correlation to Causation: Cell-Type-Specific Gene Regulatory Networks in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves complex regulatory disruptions across multiple brain cell types, yet a comprehensive understanding of the intracellular causal mechanisms remains unclear. METHODS: We presented an integrative analysis framework using single-nucleus transcriptomic with matched subject-level genotype data from 272 human AD in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) study, and constructed causality-based, cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). RESULTS: Our method identifies regulatory genes from both transcription factors (TFs) and non-TFs, thereby capturing a complete and accurate causal regulatory map across different brain cell types. This work revealed both established and novel regulations, pathways, and cell-type-unique hub genes in AD. Beyond constructing transcriptome-wide GRNs, we quantitatively assessed hub genes and distinguished those with regulatory or responsive roles. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a comprehensive mapping of cell-type-specific causal GRNs in AD, providing a powerful resource for dynamic pathway exploration, hypothesis generation, and functional interpretation.

                We provide a multimodal naturalistic neuroimaging database (NNDb-3T+), designed to support the study of brain function under both naturalistic and controlled experimental conditions. The database includes high-quality 3T fMRI data from 40 participants acquired during full-length movie-watching and three sensory mapping tasks: somatotopy, retinotopy, and tonotopy. Each participant also completed synchronized eye-tracking during movie-watching and retinotopy, physiological recordings, and a battery of behavioral and cognitive assessments. Data were collected across two MRI sessions and a remote testing session, with all data organized in a BIDS-compliant format. Technical validation confirms high data quality, with minimal head motion, accurate eye-tracker calibration, and robust task-evoked activation patterns. The database provides a unique resource for investigating individual differences, functional topographies, multimodal integration, and naturalistic cognition. All raw and preprocessed data, quality metrics, and preprocessing scripts are publicly available to support reproducible research.

">Modelling Discrete States and Long-Term Dynamics in Functional Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                Functional brain network dynamics underlie fundamental aspects of human cognition and behaviour, including memory, ageing, and a range of clinical disorders. It has been shown that ongoing brain network dynamics can be reliably inferred at fast, sub-second timescales from electrophysiological data using unsupervised machine learning. However, these methods often struggle with inherent trade-offs. For example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used to infer categorical brain network states that provide good interpretability but do not model long-range temporal structure. Recently, deep learning approaches using recurrent neural networks (e.g., Dynamic Network Modes) have been proposed to model long-range temporal dependencies, but at the expense of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Network States (DyNeStE) to address this problem. This new model employs amortised Bayesian inference with recurrent neural networks to model long-range temporal structure and uses a Gumbel-Softmax distribution to enforce categorical states for greater interpretability. In both simulations and real resting-state magnetoencephalography data, DyNeStE was able to recover plausible dynamic brain network states and showed superior performance over the HMM in capturing long-range temporal dependencies in network dynamics. These dynamic networks were reproducible across independent data splits and build on established HMM-based findings. Together, these results highlight DyNeStE as an interpretable and temporally informative framework, capable of representing large-scale neural activity as discrete state transitions while capturing transient and long-range brain network dynamics.

">Toward navigating emotional states using real-time representational similarity analysis fMRI neurofeedback - a feasibility study</a></h4>

              
                Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) is a promising non-invasive brain-computer-interface (BCI) technique for enhancing self-regulation of affective states in the brain. However, conventional univariate rt-fMRI-NF approaches are limited in their ability to distinguish neural patterns of distinct emotions that involve overlapping brain regions. In this study, we applied an rt-fMRI semantic neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-sNF) paradigm, incorporating real-time representational similarity analysis (rt-RSA) to enable navigation between emotional states. Four emotional patterns were first derived from functional localizer runs, each designed to evoke a specific emotion, and then applied as target patterns during neurofeedback. Using an RSA-informed circular semantic map (CSM), participants received real-time visual feedback indicating both the similarity and intensity of their current brain activity relative to target emotional patterns. Participants were instructed to use mental imagery to shift their brain activity toward the specific target pattern and increase its intensity. Twenty-four healthy participants completed the localizer runs, and two consecutive neurofeedback runs in the same session. Ten participants successfully engaged with both the similarity and intensity components of the CSM, showing effective modulations of their mental states. Analyses of the localizer runs revealed overlapping regional activations across emotions and demonstrated that RSA outperformed univariate analysis in distinguishing between them. For the neurofeedback runs, linear mixed-effects model (LMM) analyses across multiple performance metrics indicated consistent within-run improvements and higher initial performance in the second run, while significant between-run learning effects emerged only in exploratory models with quadratic time terms. A block-wise comparison also showed significantly higher performance at the end of each run compared to the beginning based on the intensity metric. These findings support the usability of RSA in differentiating multiple emotional states and demonstrate the feasibility of the rt-fMRI-sNF paradigm for emotion regulation.

">Altered coding of environmental boundaries in human aging: an fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with changes in spatial memory and navigation, yet the mechanisms underlying these changes are not yet fully understood. Environmental boundaries are among the most salient and reliable spatial cues, supporting both spatial memory and orientation. Here, we investigated how aging affects the use and the neural representation of boundary information during a virtual object location memory task. Healthy young and older adults navigated a square virtual environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, allowing us to assess moment-to-moment encoding of distance to environmental boundaries in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Behaviorally, both age groups showed more accurate memory for objects located near boundaries, but this effect was amplified in older adults, whose spatial precision declined more steeply with increasing distance from boundaries. Older adults also exhibited a stronger bias to recall objects closer to boundaries. Analysis of navigation behaviour revealed that older adults followed boundary-oriented paths regardless of target location, whereas young adults flexibly adapted their navigation based on spatial context. Neurally, older adults - but not young adults - showed significant blood-oxygen-level-dependent modulation by boundary distance in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum, with activity decreasing as participants moved farther from boundaries. This effect was most pronounced in low-performing older adults and was associated with stronger behavioral boundary bias, suggesting a maladaptive reliance on proximity-based cues. Together, our results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that aging alters the use and representation of boundary information, with downstream effects on spatial memory. Altered boundary processing may represent a key mechanism contributing to age-related declines in spatial cognition.

">Preparatory encoding of diverse features of intended movement in the human motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Over the course of a voluntary movement, motor cortical activity exhibits a transition from preparation to execution, with markedly different activity across these phases. Preparatory activity in particular might be used to improve brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that harness brain activity to control external assistive devices, for example by anticipating a user's intended movement trajectory for quick and fluid performance. However, to leverage preparatory activity for clinical BCIs, we must first understand which features of upcoming movements are encoded by preparatory activity in humans. In this work, we collected intracortical recordings from 3 research participants in the BrainGate2 clinical trial to investigate whether diverse features of movement, such as direction, curvature, and distance, are encoded by preparatory activity in the human motor cortex. We first show that preparatory activity is tuned to the direction of upcoming movements, and this tuning is largely preserved across movements with different effectors. Further investigation demonstrated this preparatory activity is also informative of initial and endpoint directions of curved movement trajectories, and encodes movement distance and speed independently. Finally, we present an online control paradigm that leverages preparatory activity to predict movements towards intended directions in advance, yielding rapid, self-paced control of a computer cursor by human participants. Altogether, these results demonstrate that preparatory activity in the human motor cortex encodes rich features of upcoming movement, highlighting its potential use for high performance brain-computer interface applications.

">Chronic stress facilitates behavioral engagement and alters lateral habenula activity during flexible decision making in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The ability to integrate feedback and flexibly adjust behavior under shifting environmental demands is required to optimize decision-making strategies. Clinical and preclinical data indicate that individuals with stress-related disorders and rodents exposed to chronic stress exhibit impaired behavioral flexibility. The lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a key brain region contributing to the effects of stress on cognitive performance. However, the extent to which the LHb is recruited to fine-tune decision-making strategies, as well as the impacts of chronic stress on LHb recruitment during task performance, remain largely unknown. To this end, we used a three-week model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and performed in vivo fiber photometry to investigate Ca2+ transients in LHb neurons during an attentional set-shifting task in adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (n=7-12/sex/group). We found that CUS exposure did not significantly impair behavioral flexibility. Rather, CUS-exposed rats made fewer omissions and exhibited shorter response latencies compared to controls, suggesting enhanced task engagement. We also observed sex differences in LHb Ca2+ activity. In control animals, we found that male rats showed stronger LHb signal prior to decision making, and greater activation following trial outcome than females. These differences were normalized by CUS, resulting in similar signaling patterns across sexes. Altogether, these findings reveal that chronic stress alters LHb activity in a sex-dependent manner without overtly impairing behavioral flexibility, thereby underscoring the importance of the LHb in decision making under stressful conditions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A crucial mechanism for the brain to make sense of the auditory environment is the synchronization of neural responses to external temporal regularities, such as a musical beat. It is debated whether this synchronization and the resulting beat percept reflect phase alignment of endogenous neural oscillations to the external regularity (“entrainment”), or evoked responses to the rhythmic stimulus (“tracking”). Here, we use the tempo-dependent properties of beat processing to differentiate between the two accounts. Participants listened to a repeating rhythmic pattern at different speeds. Behaviorally, they consistently tapped at the preferred beat rate (around 2 Hz) across tempi, shifting to higher metrical levels as tempo increased. We found a similar shift in EEG data, where the metrical level at which neural synchronization was strongest depended on tempo. This selective enhancement is consistent with entrainment accounts and could indeed be mimicked by an oscillator model. However, importantly, the results were also captured by a model simulating evoked responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that while neural responses to rhythm are selectively enhanced at the beat rate, this enhancement need not be taken as evidence for entrainment, but can also be explained by successive evoked responses.</span>

                <p>Perisynaptic astroglia provide critical molecular and structural support to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the nanodomain of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the adult hippocampus. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in awake male rats. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30&nbsp;min or 2&nbsp;h after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Under all conditions, &gt;85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120&nbsp;nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon&ndash;spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon&ndash;spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon&ndash;spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/39/e1018252025?rss=1">Familiarity Gates Socially Transmitted Aggression via the Medial Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aggressive behavior can be acquired through observation, providing adaptive advantages but also posing significant social risks. In humans, individuals repeatedly exposed to aggression are more likely to engage in violent behavior later in life. Yet, the environmental factors and neural mechanisms underlying observationally acquired aggression remain unclear. Here, we propose that social familiarity with an aggressor is critical for activating neural circuits in observers that primes aggression. To investigate this, we established a novel behavioral paradigm termed "socially transmitted aggression (STA)," in which witness mice observed either familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators attacking intruder mice. Remarkably, male, but not female, witnesses displayed increased aggression only after observing familiar demonstrators, with no effect from unfamiliar ones. Given that excitatory neurons in the posterior&ndash;ventral segment of the medial amygdala (MeApv) have been implicated in aggression priming, we hypothesized these neurons might be involved in STA as well. Supporting this hypothesis, fiber photometry revealed selective activation of excitatory MeApv neurons during familiar, but not unfamiliar, demonstrator attacks. Chemogenetically and optogenetically inhibiting these neurons suppressed STA, while activating them during unfamiliar demonstrator attacks promoted aggression. These results establish social familiarity as essential for the observational transmission of aggression and identify excitatory MeApv neurons as critical mediators of this phenomenon, offering potential avenues for clinical intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/39/e2073242025?rss=1">Hierarchical Organization of Human Visual Feature Attention Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Attention can be deployed in advance of visual stimuli based on features such as color or direction of motion. This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from the frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance attended information and suppress distraction. For example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. Anticipatory attention can also be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions that define task-relevant aspects of the stimuli. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where human participants of either sex were cued to either attend to a motion direction (up or down) or a color (blue or green) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band activity (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) during attention control (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (motion vs color) and specific feature attributes (up vs down; blue vs green). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (motion vs color) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (up vs down and blue vs green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first biasing the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing to the specific feature attribute.</p>

                <p>The human brain must add information to the acoustic speech signal in order to understand language. Many accounts propose that the prosodic structure of utterances (including their syllabic rhythm and speech melody), in combination with stored lexical knowledge, cue and interact with higher order abstract semantic and syntactic information. While cortical rhythms, particularly in the delta and theta band, synchronize to quasi-rhythmic low-level acoustic speech features, it remains unclear how the human brain encodes abstract speech properties in neural rhythms in the absence of an acoustic signal, i.e., when speakers hold planned sentences in working memory. This study disentangles the contributions of prosodic and syntactic features in cortical rhythms during delayed sentence repetition. Using high-resolution ECoG during awake tumor surgery in the left perisylvian cortex in nine patients (five female), we show that the phase of neural rhythms with frequencies ranging from 1 to 48&nbsp;Hz and the broadband gamma power envelope code both low-level acoustic and abstract syntactic speech features during sentence processing and retention. Syntax and prosody coding occurred in the same frequency bands, which argues against the assumption of different frequency channels for processing and representing these speech features. Our data suggest the brain leverages the phase of various neural rhythms to code both acoustic and abstract linguistic features.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/39/e2175242025?rss=1">Spatial and Temporal Factors Influencing Fixational Saccades</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much research has focused on how perceptual, cognitive, and attentional processes modulate microsaccades, the small rapid gaze shifts that humans perform when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a point. Yet the reasons why these fixational saccades occur in the first place have remained unclear. Long-standing theories have argued for either spatial (i.e., gaze centering) or temporal mechanisms (i.e., a periodical release process). However, this debate has never been resolved, primarily because of uncertainty in determining where the observer looks. Whereas modern eye-trackers enable detection of small eye movements, accurate localization of the line of sight remains challenging. Here, rather than indirectly inferring gaze position from oculomotor activity, we used a gaze-contingent procedure to directly estimate the perceived center of the visual field, a method that has been previously shown to effectively reduce uncertainty. Our results from subjects of both sexes show that the generation of fixational saccades depends on the interaction of spatial and temporal factors. Fixational saccades are remarkably accurate in correcting for fixation errors, even when gaze is minimally displaced. However, fixational saccades also occur when gaze is centered, but their latency increases as the fixation error decreases. These results suggest that fixational saccades serve an important corrective function when needed, but they can only be avoided for a limited period of time when fixation is already accurate.</p>
