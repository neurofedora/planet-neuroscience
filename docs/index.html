              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03286">A Biologically Interpretable Cognitive Architecture for Online Structuring of Episodic Memories into Cognitive Maps</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive maps provide a powerful framework for understanding spatial and abstract reasoning in biological and artificial agents. While recent computational models link cognitive maps to hippocampal-entorhinal mechanisms, they often rely on global optimization rules (e.g., backpropagation) that lack biological plausibility. In this work, we propose a novel cognitive architecture for structuring episodic memories into cognitive maps using local, Hebbian-like learning rules, compatible with neural substrate constraints. Our model integrates the Successor Features framework with episodic memories, enabling incremental, online learning through agent-environment interaction. We demonstrate its efficacy in a partially observable grid-world, where the architecture autonomously organizes memories into structured representations without centralized optimization. This work bridges computational neuroscience and AI, offering a biologically grounded approach to cognitive map formation in artificial adaptive agents.

                arXiv:2510.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors have emerged as ideal components for modeling synaptic connections in neural networks due to their ability to emulate synaptic plasticity and memory effects. Discrete models of memristor-coupled neurons are crucial for simplifying computations and efficiently analyzing large-scale neural networks. Furthermore, incorporating fractional-order calculus into discrete models enhances their capacity to capture the memory and hereditary properties inherent in biological neurons, thus reducing numerical discretization errors compared to integer-order models. Despite this potential, discrete fractional-order neural models coupled through memristors have received limited attention. To address this gap, we introduce two novel discrete fractional-order neural systems. The first system consists of two Rulkov neurons coupled via dual memristors to emulate synaptic functions. The second system expands this configuration into a ring-shaped network of neurons consisting of multiple similar subnetworks. We present a novel theorem that defines stability regions for discrete fractional-order systems, applicable to both proposed models. Integrating discrete fractional-order calculus into memristor-coupled neural models provides a foundation for more accurate and efficient simulations of neural dynamics. This work advances the understanding of neural network stability and paves the way for future research into efficient neural computations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03684">Model-Guided Microstimulation Steers Primate Visual Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast, higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task, model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation. Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more complex visual experiences.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03881">Intrinsic cause-effect power: the tradeoff between differentiation and specification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated information theory (IIT) starts from the existence of consciousness and characterizes its essential properties: every experience is intrinsic, specific, unitary, definite, and structured. IIT then formulates existence and its essential properties operationally in terms of cause-effect power of a substrate of units. Here we address IIT's operational requirements for existence by considering that, to have cause-effect power, to have it intrinsically, and to have it specifically, substrate units in their actual state must both (i) ensure the intrinsic availability of a repertoire of cause-effect states, and (ii) increase the probability of a specific cause-effect state. We showed previously that requirement (ii) can be assessed by the intrinsic difference of a state's probability from maximal differentiation. Here we show that requirement (i) can be assessed by the intrinsic difference from maximal specification. These points and their consequences for integrated information are illustrated using simple systems of micro units. When applied to macro units and systems of macro units such as neural systems, a tradeoff between differentiation and specification is a necessary condition for intrinsic existence, i.e., for consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04084">Bridging integrated information theory and the free-energy principle in living neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between {\Phi} and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of {\Phi} during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04110">Simultaneously Determining Regional Heterogeneity and Connection Directionality from Neural Activity and Symmetric Connection</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are jointly shaped by directed structural interactions and heterogeneous intrinsic features of the neural components. Despite well-developed methods for estimating directionality in network connections from network of homogeneous nodes, how local heterogeneity impacts on directionality estimation remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in shaping network directionality and how these interactions should be incorporated into reconstruction frameworks remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel reconstruction framework that simultaneously estimates effective heterogeneity across network nodes and asymmetric network connections from neural activity and symmetric connection, both are assessible in experimental data, validated using macaque cortical connectivity data and several circuit models. We found that the estimated local heterogeneity remains consistent across various forms of parameterized local circuit heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated and quantified how hidden local inhibitory populations only modify within-region connection strengths, elucidating the functional equivalence between dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory networks and purely observing excitatory networks when estimating effective heterogeneity and asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrated the sampling interval effect in estimating network interactions with respect to the sampling resolution. Together, our results not only provide a unified framework for evaluating relative functional contributions of local heterogeneity and asymmetry to overall system dynamics but also reveal the fundamental limitations and scaling principles in reconstructing neural circuit connectivity from experimental observations.

                arXiv:2510.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the representation of probability in the human mind has been of great interest to understanding human decision making. Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05098">On graphical domination for threshold-linear networks with recurrent excitation and global inhibition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical domination was first introduced in [1] in the context of combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs). There it was shown that when a domination relationship exists between a pair of vertices in a graph, certain fixed points in the corresponding CTLN can be ruled out. Here we prove two new theorems about graphical domination, and show that they apply to a significantly more general class of recurrent networks called generalized CTLNs (gCTLNs). Theorem 1 establishes that if a dominated node is removed from a network, the reduced network has exactly the same fixed points. Theorem 2 tells us that by iteratively removing dominated nodes from an initial graph $G$, the final (irreducible) graph $\widetilde{G}$ is unique. We also introduce another new family of TLNs, called E-I TLNs, consisting of $n$ excitatory nodes and a single inhibitory node providing global inhibition. We provide a concrete mapping between the parameters of gCTLNs and E-I TLNs built from the same graph such that corresponding networks have the same fixed points. We also show that Theorems 1 and 2 apply equally well to E-I TLNs, and that the dynamics of gCTLNs and E-I TLNs with the same underlying graph $G$ exhibit similar behavior that is well predicted by the fixed points of the reduced graph $\widetilde{G}$.

                arXiv:2510.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others. To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

Abstract: While neural-based models have led to significant advancements in audio feature extraction, the interpretability of the learned representations remains a critical challenge. To address this, disentanglement techniques have been integrated into discrete neural audio codecs to impose structure on the extracted tokens. However, these approaches often exhibit strong dependencies on specific datasets or task formulations. In this work, we propose a disentangled neural audio codec that leverages spectral decomposition of time-domain signals to enhance representation interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses a state-of-the-art baseline in both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality.

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: From a falcon detecting prey to humans recognizing faces, many species exhibit extraordinary abilities in rapid visual localization and classification. These are made possible by a specialized retinal region called the fovea, which provides high acuity at the center of vision while maintaining lower resolution in the periphery. This distinctive spatial organization, preserved along the early visual pathway through retinotopic mapping, is fundamental to biological vision, yet remains largely unexplored in machine learning. Our study investigates how incorporating foveated retinotopy may benefit deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. By implementing a foveated retinotopic transformation in the input layer of standard ResNet models and re-training them, we maintain comparable classification accuracy while enhancing the network's robustness to scale and rotational perturbations. Although this architectural modification introduces increased sensitivity to fixation point shifts, we demonstrate how this apparent limitation becomes advantageous: variations in classification probabilities across different gaze positions serve as effective indicators for object localization. Our findings suggest that foveated retinotopic mapping encodes implicit knowledge about visual object geometry, offering an efficient solution to the visual search problem - a capability crucial for many living species.

                arXiv:2405.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation, a foundational algorithm for training artificial neural networks, predominates in contemporary deep learning. Although highly successful, it is widely considered biologically implausible, because it relies on precise symmetry between feedforward and feedback weights to accurately propagate gradient signals that assign credit. The so-called weight transport problem concerns how biological brains learn to align feedforward and feedback paths while avoiding the non-biological transport of feedforward weights into feedback weights. To address this, several credit assignment algorithms, such as feedback alignment and the Kollen-Pollack rule, have been proposed. While they can achieve the desired weight alignment, these algorithms imply that if a neuron sends a feedforward synapse to another neuron, it should also receive an identical or at least partially correlated feedback synapse from the latter neuron, thereby forming a bidirectional connection. However, this idealized connectivity pattern contradicts experimental observations in the brain, a discrepancy we refer to as the weight symmetry problem. To address this challenge posed by considering biological constraints on connectivity, we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. We demonstrate that PFA can eliminate explicit weight symmetry entirely while closely approximating backpropagation and achieving comparable performance in deep convolutional networks. Our results offer a novel approach to solve the longstanding problem of credit assignment in the brain, leading to more biologically plausible learning in deep networks compared to previous methods.

                arXiv:2510.03306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current atlas-based approaches to brain network analysis rely heavily on standardized anatomical or connectivity-driven brain atlases. However, these fixed atlases often introduce significant limitations, such as spatial misalignment across individuals, functional heterogeneity within predefined regions, and atlas-selection biases, collectively undermining the reliability and interpretability of the derived brain networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel atlas-free brain network transformer (atlas-free BNT) that leverages individualized brain parcellations derived directly from subject-specific resting-state fMRI data. Our approach computes ROI-to-voxel connectivity features in a standardized voxel-based feature space, which are subsequently processed using the BNT architecture to produce comparable subject-level embeddings. Experimental evaluations on sex classification and brain-connectome age prediction tasks demonstrate that our atlas-free BNT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art atlas-based methods, including elastic net, BrainGNN, Graphormer and the original BNT. Our atlas-free approach significantly improves the precision, robustness, and generalizability of brain network analyses. This advancement holds great potential to enhance neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical diagnostic tools for personalized precision medicine.

                arXiv:2510.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.

                arXiv:2510.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram monitoring devices and online data repositories hold large amounts of data from individuals participating in research and medical studies without direct reference to personal identifiers. This paper explores what types of personal and health information have been detected and classified within task-free EEG data. Additionally, we investigate key characteristics of the collected resting-state and sleep data, in order to determine the privacy risks involved with openly available EEG data. We used Google Scholar, Web of Science and searched relevant journals to find studies which classified or detected the presence of various disorders and personal information in resting state and sleep EEG. Only English full-text peer-reviewed journal articles or conference papers about classifying the presence of medical disorders between individuals were included. A quality analysis carried out by 3 reviewers determined general paper quality based on specified evaluation criteria. In resting state EEG, various disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parkinson's disease, and alcohol use disorder have been classified with high classification accuracy, often requiring only 5 mins of data or less. Sleep EEG tends to hold classifiable information about sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, and REM sleep disorder, but usually involve longer recordings or data from multiple sleep stages. Many classification methods are still developing but even today, access to a person's EEG can reveal sensitive personal health information. With an increasing ability of machine learning methods to re-identify individuals from their EEG data, this review demonstrates the importance of anonymization, and the development of improved tools for keeping study participants and medical EEG users' privacy safe.

                arXiv:2510.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), recognized as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), have advanced rapidly through the scaling of models and datasets. However, such scaling incurs considerable training overhead, posing challenges for researchers with limited computational resources and hindering the sustained development of SNNs. Data pruning is a promising strategy for accelerating training by retaining the most informative examples and discarding redundant ones, but it remains largely unexplored in SNNs. Directly applying ANN-based data pruning methods to SNNs fails to capture the intrinsic importance of examples and suffers from high gradient variance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spike-aware data pruning (SADP) method. SADP reduces gradient variance by determining each example's selection probability to be proportional to its gradient norm, while avoiding the high cost of direct gradient computation through an efficient upper bound, termed spike-aware importance score. This score accounts for the influence of all-or-nothing spikes on the gradient norm and can be computed with negligible overhead. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SADP consistently outperforms data pruning baselines and achieves training speedups close to the theoretical maxima at different pruning ratios. Notably, SADP reduces training time by 35% on ImageNet while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of full-data training. This work, therefore, establishes a data-centric paradigm for efficient SNN training and paves the way for scaling SNNs to larger models and datasets. The source code will be released publicly after the review process.

                arXiv:2510.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across tasks but remain energy-intensive due to dense matrix operations. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) improve energy efficiency by replacing dense matrix multiplications with sparse accumulations. Their sparse spike activity enables efficient LLMs deployment on edge devices. However, prior SNN-based LLMs often sacrifice performance for efficiency, and recovering accuracy typically requires full pretraining, which is costly and impractical. To address this, we propose SpikingMamba, an energy-efficient SNN-based LLMs distilled from Mamba that improves energy efficiency with minimal accuracy sacrifice. SpikingMamba integrates two key components: (a) TI-LIF, a ternary-integer spiking neuron that preserves semantic polarity through signed multi-level spike representations. (b) A training-exclusive Smoothed Gradient Compensation (SGC) path mitigating quantization loss while preserving spike-driven efficiency. We employ a single-stage distillation strategy to transfer the zero-shot ability of pretrained Mamba and further enhance it via reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments show that SpikingMamba-1.3B achieves a 4.76$\times$ energy benefit, with only a 4.78\% zero-shot accuracy gap compared to the original Mamba, and achieves a further 2.55\% accuracy improvement after RL.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for applying metaheuristic algorithms, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), to combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) like the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The framework consists of three sequential stages: broad exploration of the parameter space, exploitation of top-performing parameters, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess the reliability of results. As a case study, we apply ACO to the TSPLIB berlin52 dataset, which has a known optimal tour length of 7542. Using our framework, we calculate that the probability of ACO finding the global optimum is approximately 1/40 in a single run and improves to 1/5 when aggregated over ten runs.

                arXiv:2510.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations.

                arXiv:2510.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate decade-scale daily runoff forecasting in small watersheds is difficult because signals blend drifting trends, multi-scale seasonal cycles, regime shifts, and sparse extremes. Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement, frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance, flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment, augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter / LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a ~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818, improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.

                arXiv:2510.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution (LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW, where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including optical metrology and microscopy.

                arXiv:2510.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) offers a method for training controllable level designer agents without the need for human datasets, using metrics that serve as proxies for level quality as rewards. Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes, which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed, multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.

                arXiv:2510.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.

Abstract: The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and tone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral, Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.

                arXiv:2501.06572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast EAs as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

                arXiv:2405.09351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that, depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller than or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and infinite depth cases. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding and universal approximation, i.e., on the exact and approximate representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs.

                arXiv:2506.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi 2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

                In neural information processing, the nervous system transmits neuronal activity between layers of neural circuits, occasionally passing through small layers composed only of sparse neurons. Hippocampal hilar mossy cells (MCs) constitute such a typical bottleneck layer. However, how efficient information encoding is achieved within such constrained layers remains poorly understood. To address this, we focused on sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) – synchronous neural events originating in the CA3 region – and investigated functional diversity within MC populations using in vivo/in vitro patch-clamp recordings in mice. By combining machine learning algorithms, we developed a model to predict CA3 SWR waveforms based on the synaptic response waveforms of MCs, suggesting that SWR-related information is indeed encoded in their subthreshold activity. While individual MCs were generally associated with specific SWR clusters, partial overlap across some MCs was also observed, indicating that CA3 activity is distributed across the MC population. Our findings suggest that CA3 SWR activity is represented in a pseudo-orthogonal manner across MC populations, allowing the small MC layer to effectively compress and relay hippocampal information.

">Measured and modelled transitions between self-paced walking and synchronization with rhythmic auditory cues</a></h4>

              
                Constraining gait rhythm with a metronome has been shown to influence gait pattern in many different ways. While rhythmic cues can improve several parameters in some clinical populations, they do alter the long-range autocorrelations naturally exhibited in series of stride durations. However, transitions between walking with and without a metronome (and vice versa) have not been measured; it is therefore unclear how people adapt to such a change in task. To address this gap, a total of 21 healthy volunteers were asked to walk overground under three conditions: one unconstrained control condition, followed by two conditions in which a metronome was activated during either the first or second half of the trial to test both transitions. The long-range autocorrelations were assessed over a sliding window on the stride series to measure their evolution. Our observations were reproduced with a computational model allowing us to relate sudden changes in movement parameters to the long-range autocorrelations, which are typically measured over longer timescales. The results showed a clear transition in both conditions involving a metronome, with long-range autocorrelations of the series of stride durations gradually reduced when the metronome was turned on and recovered when it was turned off. In these two conditions, the change in long-range autocorrelations could be reproduced in the model by an instantaneous switching of the control policy associated with the presence or not of the metronome, suggesting that long-range autocorrelations emerge from a flexible control strategy that rapidly regulates timing and amplitude parameters according to task requirements.

">Selective innervation of subpopulations of striatal neurons by distinct sets of neurons of the external globus pallidus</a></h4>

              
                The striatum, the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, contains diverse populations of projection neurons and interneurons, each with distinct roles in motor processing. The external globus pallidus contains distinct populations of inhibitory neurons that are highly interconnected with other regions of the basal ganglia. How pallidal neurons innervate different populations of striatal neurons is critical for our understanding of their role in motor processing. Here we use monosynaptic viral tracing in transgenic mice to quantitively define the organization of pallidostriatal connectivity. We show that FoxP2-expressing arkypallidal neurons provide the greatest input to the striatum, primarily targeting indirect pathway spiny projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons. In contrast, prototypic pallidal neurons, defined by Nkx2-1 expression, preferentially innervate parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. These data reveal a structured and selective organization of pallidostriatal projections, suggesting that distinct classes of pallidal neurons modulate striatal circuits through complementary pathways. Mapping these connections is key to understanding how basal ganglia networks coordinate motor control.

">CORTICAL AUDITORY PROCESSING FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD: ASSOCIATIONS WITH SPEECH UNDERSTANDING</a></h4>

              
                The maturation of the auditory system is critical for the development of speech perception from childhood through early adulthood. However, the developmental trajectories and behavioral significance of cortical responses to speech sounds, particularly in relation to frequency specificity, remain poorly understood. Here, we presented low-frequency (/m/) and high-frequency (/s/) speech sounds to 60 typically developing individuals aged 5-24 years and recorded early cortical responses (P1 and N1) using electroencephalography. We also examined associations between these neural responses and speech understanding in quiet and in the presence of speech interferers. The developmental trajectories of P1 and N1 revealed distinct age- and stimulus-dependent patterns, including both linear and non-linear changes across development. These findings delineate frequency-specific maturational profiles within the cortical auditory system and identify potential neurophysiological markers of speech perception, providing a normative benchmark for assessing atypical auditory development.

">Evidence for age-related vulnerability in dopamine-glutamate projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is selectively vulnerable to age-related decline and is essential for novelty detection and episodic memory. While dopaminergic (DAergic) input is known to modulate LEC function, how aging impacts this circuitry remains unclear. Here, we used two viral labeling strategies to investigate projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the LEC. First, we employed an INTRSECT dual-recombinase approach in TH-Flp::VGLUT2-Cre mice to selectively label dopamine-only (DA-only) and dopamine-glutamate co-releasing (DA-GLU) neurons. Next, we used a DAT-Cre-driven ChR2-YFP strategy to broadly label all DA axons. We found that both DA-only and DA-GLU populations innervate the LEC. With age, we observed a selective reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) signal within DA axons in the LEC, despite preserved axonal structure as revealed by YFP labeling. VGLUT2 signal within DA-GLU terminals appeared less affected. In the VTA, TH+ neuron density declined with age, with distinct spatial patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. These findings reveal an age-related vulnerability of DAergic projections to the LEC and suggest a circuit-level mechanism may contribute to memory impairments in aging.

">Investigating the effect of channel pruning on functional near-infrared spectroscopy data collected from children aged 5-24 months</a></h4>

              
                Significance Infant functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data are particularly vulnerable to noise; participant behaviour can result in motion artefacts and reduced set-up times can cause poor optode coupling. Accurate channel pruning is therefore essential but approaches vary and often use adult-derived thresholds, risking unnecessary data loss. Aim This work systematically compared pruning approaches and parameter choices to evaluate their effects on data quality and retention in infant fNIRS. Approach Data from 5-24 month-old infants were collected across two cohorts, using two paradigms. Channel pruning was performed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Quality Testing of Near Infrared Scans (QT-NIRS) tool, varying key thresholds. Multilevel models assessed effects of pruning method, parameter choice, age, motion, and testing site on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channels retained. Results QT-NIRS produced significantly higher SNR than CV pruning across nearly all age, task, and cohort combinations, when matched for data retention. Higher QT-NIRS thresholds improved quality but reduced retention. Motion prevalence strongly reduced both SNR and retention; testing site and age had smaller but notable effects. Conclusions QT-NIRS offers a better balance of data quality and retention than CV pruning. Lower QT-NIRS thresholds than adult defaults are recommended for infant data. These findings provide practical guidance for preprocessing pipelines in developmental fNIRS research.

">Astrocytes and neurons encode natural stimuli with partially shared but distinct composite receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active participants in sensory processing, but whether they show selective responses to stimulus features, analogous to neuronal receptive fields, is not yet established. To address this, we used two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of anesthetized mice during presentation of natural ultrasonic vocalizations. Our aim was to compare astrocytic responses with those of neighboring neurons and to determine whether astrocytes exhibit feature-selective receptive fields. Event detection showed that astrocytic calcium activity is highly heterogeneous, but only a minority of events were consistently stimulus-linked. To examine this stimulus-driven subset, we estimated receptive field features using maximum noise entropy modeling and compared them with those of concurrently recorded neurons. Despite qualitative similarities in receptive-field features, analysis of modulation spectra and principal angles showed that astrocytic and neuronal receptive fields overlap but occupy distinct regions of feature space. This indicates that astrocytes and neurons encode partially shared, but not identical, dimensions of the sensory stimulus. Our findings indicate that astrocytes encode diverse sensory features, providing an additional contribution to neuronal encoding. This suggests that astrocytic calcium activity is not simply a reflection of neuronal firing, but instead represents a distinct component of cortical sensory processing.

">Sexual Dimorphism in c-Fos Networks Governing Aggression</a></h4>

              
                Circuit based studies of aggression often focus on the output of a small group of regions referred to as the core aggression circuit, yet a whole brain map of activity has yet to be produced. Using resident intruder assays in male and female Swiss Webster mice, we combined iDISCO+ cFos imaging with a weighted co-expression network analyses to identify mesoscale co-activation modules in aggressive (AGG) vs. non-aggressive (NON) animals. We performed a module preservation analysis between each phenotype within each sex followed by differential correlation to localize edge-level changes. Behaviorally, AGG mice spent more time attacking, while females showed greater social investigation. Network analyses revealed that NON networks often preserved density of AGG modules, but connectivity reorganized with aggression. In male AGGs there was large spread reorganization of numerous modules: a large sensorimotor subcortical blue module, a pallidal/hypothalamic/brainstem yellow module, and a brainstem-heavy green module. Surprisingly the brown module, enriched for classic social-behavior regions was moderately preserved in male NONs. In females, the turquoise module spanning somatosensory/interoceptive cortex and midbrain regions and the brown sensory cortex/amygdala module were the least preserved. These results indicate that aggression recruits distributed mesoscale communities via edge-specific gain, with males displaying broad strengthening along a cortex/basal ganglia/ hypothalamus/brainstem axis and females showing more targeted potentiation within sensory/arousal modules. This framework nominates candidate hubs and edges for causal manipulation.

">Typical development of the human fetal subplate: regional heterogeneity, growth, and asymmetry assessed by in vivo T2-weighted MRI</a></h4>

              
                The subplate (SP) is a transient fetal brain compartment supporting neuronal migration, axonal ingrowth, and early cortical activity, yet the dynamics of its regional development remain poorly understood in vivo. Using T2-weighted fetal MRI of 68 typically developing fetuses (22-32 weeks gestational age, GA), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to quantify regional SP morphology (thickness, surface area, and volume). SP characteristics scaled strongly with GA and residual brain volume and showed marked regional differences. After correcting for geometric confounds, regional variation of SP thickness persisted, with highest values in parietal and perisylvian regions, suggesting that SP thickness may serve as a sensitive marker of intrinsic developmental differences. Between late 2nd and early 3rd trimester, mean SP thickness increased by 39.2% with large variation across regions (11.0 SD), whereas surface area growth was more uniform (64.3%, 0.7 SD). Continuous growth trajectories clustered into distinct spatiotemporal profiles: early-developing regions (e.g., pericentral and medial occipital cortices) contrasted with later-developing regions (prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices). These patterns partially recapitulate primary-to-association, medial-to-lateral, and posterior-to-anterior maturational hierarchies, pointing to organized developmental program. SP development also showed region-specific hemispheric asymmetries, including leftward thickness and volume asymmetry in superior temporal and precentral gyri. Some asymmetries amplified, others attenuated or reversed with age, suggesting both transient states and potential precursors of postnatal lateralization. Together, these findings provide a framework for regional SP quantification and position SP morphology, particularly thickness, as a promising early biomarker that might link fetal SP changes to subsequent cortical development and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

">Non-overlapping social and food reward representations in the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The ability to consider and appraise positively valenced stimuli in the environment, such as food and social interaction, to guide appropriate action is important for survival of most animals. Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given that the BLA and mPFC play differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.

">Cerebral cortical structures linked to intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis of intelligence in humans remains an ongoing scientific pursuit. Early studies with small samples identified potential regions but lacked consistency across findings. Recent large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets, using intelligence measures focused on verbal-numerical reasoning, now offer more robust opportunities for discovery. In this study (N=11,289), we showed the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as exhibiting the strongest effect size and a significant causal relationship with intelligence, where larger surface area predicts higher intelligence as revealed by Mendelian randomization analyses. Additional regions, including the orbitofrontal and temporal cortices, also showed causal links to intelligence. These regions are critical for working memory, executive function, and language. Reverse causality analyses further indicated that higher intelligence contributes to increased total surface area and greater cortical thickness in the perisylvian language region. Our findings replicate prior evidence of a bidirectional relationship between total surface area and intelligence and further offer novel insights into regional cortical associations and causal effect. Collectively, these findings support a polyregional cortical configuration of intelligence, highlighting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a key hub for cognitive ability.

">A parietal grid-like code rotates with cognitive maps but lags rapid behavioral transfer</a></h4>

              
                The neural grid code has been proposed to provide a mechanism for generalization and transfer of relational knowledge between situations enabling rapid adaptation of behavior in novel circumstances. However, to date, very little is known about the dynamics with which grid representations change at context transitions, or how such dynamics relate to downstream behavioral adaptation. Here we tested whether grid representations measured with fMRI rotate to match behavioral goals at context transitions and whether such rotations underlie knowledge transfer. Human participants performed a task that included unsignaled state changes at which the position of multiple target locations abruptly and synchronously rotated by the same degree. After state changes, participants were able to leverage the relative positions of the targets to rapidly infer locations, even novel ones, constituting a form of zero-shot transfer. We observed a cognitive grid-like code in the right posterior parietal cortex with a consistent phase angle that rotated with the relative positions of the targets. However, this rotation was too slow to account for rapid improvements in performance after a state change, and instead these improvements were more closely related to representations of the identity and location of spatial targets in the frontoparietal and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. Our results highlight the ability of humans to rapidly transfer knowledge and demonstrate that a parietal grid-like code rotates into behaviorally relevant reference frames, but raise questions about the function of such rotations, pointing instead to alternate neural mechanisms for rapid knowledge transfer.

">Multilayer control of KaiR1D-autoreceptor function by the auxiliary protein Neto</a></h4>

              
                Kainate-type glutamate receptors and their dedicated auxiliary protein Neto function at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to regulate the activity of synaptic networks. However, attributing specific synaptic functions to Neto and/or kainate receptors is challenging. Here we focus on Drosophila KaiR1D receptors, which modulate synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junction, and elucidate the role of Neto in the regulation of autoreceptor activities and neurotransmitter release. We show that Neto- limits the presynaptic accumulation and function of KaiR1D autoreceptors in vivo. Using outside-out patch recordings, we demonstrate that Neto- modulates the KaiR1D gating properties, slowing desensitization and attenuating the block by intracellular polyamines and extracellular toxins. Neto- also promotes the axonal distribution of KaiR1D, but this function is not critical for the KaiR1D-dependent regulation of synaptic transmission. Instead, Neto- increases the KaiR1D-mediated charge transfer leading to increased neurotransmitter release. Our data demonstrate that Neto- provides multiple layers of modulation to KaiR1D autoreceptors to ensure proper neurotransmitter release. These findings also suggest that coordinated regulation of receptor function and localization represents an ancestral strategy to safeguard synaptic stability.

">LACK OF OXYGEN AND/OR GLUCOSE DIFFERENTIALLY POTENTIATES Aβ40EQ22- AND Aβ42-INDUCED CEREBRAL ENDOTHELIAL CELL DEATH, BARRIER DYFUNCTION AND ANGIOGENESIS IMPAIRMENT</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disrupted brain hemodynamics and cerebrovascular damage resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion occur early within Alzheimers Disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cerebral hypoperfusion is also an extremely common consequence of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases (CVRFs/CVDs), which usually manifest in midlife, when AD pathology initiates, and actively contribute to AD onset and progression. Previously our lab has demonstrated that the vasculotropic Dutch mutant, amyloid beta Q22, and amyloid beta 42 promote endothelial cells (ECs) apoptosis, barrier permeability, and angiogenic impairments. Prior research has indicated that hypoperfusion promotes analogous EC dysfunction. Amyloid beta deposition occurs within a hypoperfused environment in AD, but whether exposure of cerebral ECs to amyloid beta under hypoperfusion results in potentiated cerebral EC dysfunction through activation of common molecular mechanisms remained unknown. Methods: Human cerebral ECs were treated with Amyloid beta 40-Q22 or Amyloid beta 42, glucose deprivation (GD), or a combination of both, under normoxia or hypoxia conditions. Cell death mechanisms (apoptosis/necrosis), endothelial barrier dysfunction/permeability (TEER/barrier-regulating proteins/proinflammatory activation), and angiogenesis impairment (vessel branching/VEGF signaling) were evaluated. Results: Reduction of glucose and/or oxygen potentiates Amyloid-induced cerebral EC death, barrier instability, junction protein dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and angiogenesis/wound healing failure. In particular, hypoperfusion exacerbates Amyloid beta Q22-mediated cerebral EC apoptosis, TEER/ZO1 decreases, ICAM1, IL6, and IL8 upregulation, monocyte migration, and wound healing impairments. Differentially, when in combination with Amyloid beta 42, hypoperfusion more strongly potentiates cerebral EC necrosis as well as increases in MMP2, phosphorylated claudin-5, IFN gamma, and IL12p70 expression. Additionally, this study identified that GD exerts stronger effects on promoting increases in cerebral EC caspase-3 activation, apoptosis, and MMP2/ICAM1 expression, while hypoxia particularly increases necrosis, ZO1 expression, and pro-angiogenic protein expression. Conclusions: This study reveals specific and selective mechanisms through which hypoxia, low glucose and amyloidosis mutually operate to produce brain EC dysfunction and death, highlighting new potential molecular targets against vascular pathology in AD/CAA comorbid with hypoperfusion conditions.

                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban and agricultural use and industrial operations, but anthropogenic pollution has a serious negative impact on its water quality. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background There is a limited range of treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a cancer known for its aggressiveness; therefore, innovative alternative therapies are required. A link between TNBC progression and bacterial dysbiosis in the gut microenvironment has been demonstrated. Thai traditional formulary medicine (TTFM), comprising bioactive natural products and medicinal plants, exhibits anti-cancer properties. However, the effectiveness of TTFM against breast cancer (BC) has not been clarified. The present study aimed to identify the secondary metabolites of TTFM and investigate its effects on BC both in vitro and in vivo. Methods The metabolite profiles of TTFM extracts were investigated using LC-MS/MS analysis. The anti-cancer activities were examined using a cell viability assay. The effects on the apoptosis pathway and gene expression profiles were also investigated using an apoptosis assay and RNA sequencing analysis. Next, TTFM extracts were examined in 4T1 xenografted mouse models. The gut microbiota profiles and tumor gene expression were investigated by 16S rDNA sequencing and nanoString, respectively. Results LC-MS/MS identified 302 compounds in the TTFM extract. In breast cancer cells, TTFM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Additionally, TTFM treatment partially restored the gut microbiota balance, increasing the abundance of Butyrivibrio hungatei and reducing Clostridium saccharolyticum. NanoString analysis showed that TTFM modulated immune responses by upregulating the Pias1 gene and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1r2, IL-1β, IL-2) and cancer-related genes (Ccno, Nkd1). Conclusion This study highlights the anti-cancer potential of TTFM extracts, suggesting its future use in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

                Tuberculosis of the parotid is an uncommon presentation, as the gland is rarely a primary site of infection. It is often confused with malignant tumors because of the similarity of the clinical presentation (the presence of a progressive and abscessed parotid swelling) We present the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with chronic indurated right parotid gland swelling evolving from one month with fever. Clinical examination objectified a painful, indurated right parotid mass measuring 7 cm with ipsilateral grade 2 right peripheral facial palsy. Imaging showed a solid-cystic parotid mass with lysis of the mandibular condyle. Malignancy was suspected. However, biopsy confirmed tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was ruled out. The patient responded well to anti-tuberculosis therapy, showing significant improvement after six months. Parotid gland tuberculosis is very rare and can mimic malignant tumors. It is crucial to rule out this diagnosis, especially in countries where tuberculosis is common, during the diagnosis process.

                Background India records the highest number of suicide deaths globally, but suicide prevention efforts are hindered by a lack of trained personnel within the public health system. Given that an index suicide attempt is a strong predictor of future suicide, intervening with individuals who have recently attempted suicide is a targeted prevention approach that can be delivered within the public health system and has potential to be scaled up across low-resource settings. Aim To test the implementation and preliminary effectiveness of Contact and Safety Planning (CASP) in reducing suicidal behaviour and symptoms of depression among adults with a recent suicide attempt in Chhattisgarh. Methods We will carry out a non-randomized, controlled pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, reach, implementation (including cost) and preliminary effectiveness of CASP when delivered by health workers – emergency nurses and Community Health Officers – in two districts of Chhattisgarh (n=250). The control group will receive Enhanced Usual Care, consisting of telephonic counselling by trained District Mental Health (n=250) program staff. Data will be collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow- up. Conclusion This study will shed light on the feasibility of CASP and inform its further refinement to address suicide at scale in India.

                Background The nursing profession is increasingly appealing to male students at the undergraduate level. Society’s demand for nurses, particularly male nurses, is rising; nevertheless, the availability of clinical placements for nursing students is insufficient to meet this demand. Simulation has significantly advanced as an educational method for training healthcare personnel. Simulation makes replicating real-life events and honing skills like clinical decision-making and communication. Using simulation as an adjunct or alternative to clinical practice is now under discussion. Simulation is a resource-intensive pedagogical approach, necessitating careful consideration of its organization and implementation to maximize efficiency without undermining learning outcomes. Objective This study aimed to explore simulation as a teaching pedagogy for male undergraduate nursing students in the United Arab Emirates. Method This study adopted a descriptive qualitative approach. The purposive sampling method recruited 43 male students from nursing programs in the University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the individual interviews. In addition, two focus group discussions were conducted on an online meeting platform. Data analysis was done using thematic analysis. Results In this study, we identified four major themes: 1) Students’ perceptions of simulation, 2) Preparation for realistic situations, 3) Feeling of anxiety and stress, and 4) Theory and practice abilities gaps. Conclusion The study findings indicate that male nursing students received the overall simulation experience well. The study highlights the importance of skilled and encouraging simulation instructors who can provide participants with valuable guidance and feedback for more individualized teaching. Study results provide important new information about how simulation-based learning could improve nursing education and further studies in this field. The findings shed light on the problems that male nursing students have been dealing with for years and highlight efforts to make changes as soon as feasible. It may be helpful to revise the simulation to provide more opportunities for independent problem-solving skills and to incorporate more real-life factors and variables into the scenario. Additionally, developing more individualized approaches to building self-confidence may be helpful, such as providing personalized feedback and guidance based on each student’s strengths and weaknesses.

                Background The August Revolution of 1945 established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but the nascent government immediately faced immense challenges from external forces like French colonialists and Chiang Kai-shek’s army, alongside internal difficulties. In this precarious situation, diplomacy emerged as a crucial strategic tool for the Vietnamese revolution during the 1945-1946 period, demonstrating a skillful blend of struggle and negotiation to safeguard independence. Methods This study is grounded in the principles of dialectical and historical materialism, consistent with the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The main methods include: the historical method (systematic examination of events and policies), the logical method (reconstructing diplomatic strategies), intertextual analysis (comparing Party directives with diplomatic actions), critical discourse analysis (Ho Chi Minh’s statements), and comparative assessment (with other decolonization movements). Data were collected from declassified archival materials, legal texts, diplomatic records, and contemporary press. Results During 1945-1946, Vietnam implemented an independent, self-reliant, and open foreign policy based on principles of equality and mutual assistance, with the core objective of protecting independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This policy demonstrated strategic flexibility by conciliating Chiang Kai-shek’s forces to free up resources against the French, and by signing the Preliminary Accord and Provisional Agreement with France to gain time for resistance preparation. Vietnamese diplomacy also proactively established friendly relations with neighboring countries and major powers, sought international recognition, and committed to multilateral cooperation, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of the revolutionary government. Conclusion In an extremely challenging situation, foreign affairs activities, under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, successfully protected Vietnam’s independence and enhanced the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s prestige. The strategic lessons on foreign policy thinking from 1945-1946 have become a firm foundation for Vietnam’s modern foreign policy. They emphasize the harmonious combination of national independence, socialism, genuine patriotism, and internationalism, striving towards the ultimate goal of building a “prosperous people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization” in Vietnam.

                Background Intestinal parasitosis are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa. The tropical climate in the D.R. Congo provides parasites with an environment conducive to their proliferation. The prevalence rates of intestinal parasitosis remain poorly understood in the D.R. Congo. Objective This study aims to estimate the overall and specific prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and to determine an association between intestinal parasitosis and the season at CHUNDE. Methods From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, patients for whom a direct stool examination was requested at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center were included in this study. Stool samples were collected and examined under an optical microscope. Results During the period of the study, we recorded 187 patients aged 2 to 77 years. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 75.40%. The specific prevalence rates for parasites were as follows: E. histolytica/dispar, the most common, with a prevalence of 55.08%, followed by P. hominis and G. lamblia with respective prevalence rates of 9.09% and 6.24%. A. lumbricoide had a prevalence of 27.81%, followed by S. mansoni, A. duodenalis, and E. vermicularis with respective prevalence rates of 3.74%, 1.60%, and 1.07%. There was no association between the season and the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was higher amang symptomatic patients at CHUNDE. There is no statistically valid association between the season and the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-665/v2?src=rss">New Horizons in Higher Education: Examining the Mental Well-Being of Medical & Health Sciences Students Through the Use of Artificial Intelligence Based Chatbot Platforms in the United Arab Emirates – A Cross-Sectional Comparative Study [version 2; peer r</a></h4>

              
                Background Barriers to mental-health care include limited resources and workforce, access constraints, and stigma. Artificial-intelligence (AI)–enabled chatbots may offer low-threshold support. Methods Cross-sectional correlational (comparative) study in one private health-sciences university in the UAE. Proportional stratified random sampling across four colleges yielded n = 298 undergraduates. Instruments: (i) Socio-Demographic Questionnaire; (ii) researcher-developed AI Chatbot Usability questionnaire (content validated by a bilingual specialist); and (iii) Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21; established reliability/validity). Questionnaires were administered face-to-face with standardized instructions. Results 206/298 (69.1%) had ever used an AI chatbot; most used Snapchat AI (76.9%), followed by ChatGPT/Bard (23.4% each). Overall, 57.0% had moderate-to-extremely-severe depression, 68.5% anxiety, and 33.6% stress. Users had higher odds of moderate-to-extremely-severe anxiety and depression than non-users. In multivariable models, higher depression (OR = 1.022; 95% CI 1.01–1.085; p<0.001) and anxiety (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 1.01–1.21; p<0.001) independently predicted chatbot use; stress did not. Conclusion Among UAE health-sciences students, AI-chatbot use is common and associated with higher depression/anxiety severity; this likely reflects help-seeking rather than causation. Universities should integrate early, stigma-sensitive supports, potentially including regulated, evidence-based chatbot tools—within stepped-care services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1046/v1?src=rss">The Role of Corporate Political Activity in Shaping Organizational Outcomes: A Systematic Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Corporate Political Activity (CPA) has gained growing academic attention as a non-market strategy for influencing policy, reducing uncertainty, and enhancing firm-level outcomes. However, existing studies remain fragmented, often confined to single industries, regions, or political mechanisms, with limited cross-country comparisons and minimal exploration of digital political engagement. Moreover, no recent comprehensive synthesis has captured post-2020 developments across diverse institutional and industrial contexts, leaving gaps in understanding the broader patterns and boundary conditions of CPA effectiveness. Methods This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of peer-reviewed empirical articles published between 2020 and 2025, guided by the PRISMA framework. Articles were systematically identified, screened, and synthesized from the Scopus database. Out of 589 initial articles, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Results The findings show that CPA is primarily positioned as an independent variable affecting performance, innovation, and competitiveness. While CPA frequently generates positive outcomes, risks such as agency problems, reputational damage, and bribery emerge in weak governance environments. The review also reveals that integrating Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) with CPA strengthens legitimacy and strategic impact, particularly in politically volatile contexts. Conclusions Theoretically, this study contributes by mapping empirical trends, clarifying contextual boundary conditions, and proposing an integrated conceptual framework that bridges resource-based and institutional perspectives on CPA. Practically, it offers guidelines for aligning political engagement with ethical governance, enabling firms to leverage CPA–CSR integration to navigate complex institutional environments while maintaining legitimacy and stakeholder trust.

                Background The rapid growth of social media has created new opportunities for brands to reach consumers through influencer marketing. While influencers are increasingly recognized as effective opinion leaders, less is known about the psychological mechanisms through which their content shapes purchasing behaviour. This study investigates the impact of influencer marketing on consumers’ purchase intentions, with particular attention to the mediating role of consumer attitude. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May and June 2025. Data were collected from 326 active social media users who follow influencers online. Respondents completed a structured questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed with SPSS and AMOS, employing reliability testing, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation modelling. Mediation was tested using bootstrapping procedures with 5,000 resamples. Results The measurement models demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity after refinement. The structural model indicated that influencer marketing exerted a strong positive effect on purchase intention (β = 0.83, R2 = 0.68, p < .001). When consumer attitude was introduced as a mediator, the direct effect of influencer marketing on purchase intention decreased (β ≈ 0.44–0.46) but remained significant. The indirect effect through consumer attitude was also significant (≈ 0.39, p < .001), confirming that attitude partially mediates the relationship. Conclusions The findings highlight the dual role of influencer marketing in shaping consumer decisions: directly influencing purchase intention while also operating indirectly through favourable attitudes. For practitioners, the results emphasize the importance of selecting influencers who are credible, authentic, and aligned with the brand, as well as creating engaging, high-quality content that encourages interaction with followers. The study contributes to theory by reinforcing the mediating role of attitude in the persuasion process and offers practical guidance for designing more effective influencer marketing campaigns.

                The importance of urban health in achieving population and planetary health goals is increasingly recognized. Cities offer important opportunities to improve health and wellbeing while also presenting significant challenges. As our understanding of, and evidence, for the importance of determinants of health beyond health care have grown, the need for urban health policies and actions that transcend disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and involve multiple stakeholders in urban decision-making has become clearer. Current urban health practice builds on decades of conceptual and operational work. This paper traces the evolution of the urban health paradigm through research, policy and practice in recent decades. We suggest that, despite the proven utility of urban health as a paradigm and its conceptual and practical evolution for effective urban health governance, significant challenges remain, especially related to implementing the systems approaches needed to improve health and wellbeing amidst the complexity of urban dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1044/v1?src=rss">The role of desire over obligation in explaining continued smoking abstinence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective To assess the role of self-reported desire over obligation in explaining continued smoking abstinence among people who recently stopped smoking. Method An observational study with cross-sectional and 12-month follow up data including 230 (45.2% female; mean age 45.4 years) adults in England who confirmed they had made a serious quit attempt and were not currently smoking at baseline. The predictor variable was assessed at baseline through responses to the statement: “I am stopping smoking because I want to rather than because I feel I have to” on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = ‘strongly disagree’; 7 = ‘strongly agree’). The outcome was smoking status at 12-month follow-up. Covariates were baseline sociodemographic and smoking-related characteristics. Associations were assessed with logistic regression. Results At 12-month follow-up, 59.1% (n=136) reported they were still not smoking and 40.9% (n=94) had restarted smoking. Longer time since quit was positively associated with quit success maintenance at 12-months (adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.04-1.58). People who were more strongly motivated to quit by desire were equally or less likely to still be abstinent at 12-months than those who were more motivated by obligation (AOR 0.85, 95%CI 0.70-1.01). Conclusion Being more motivated by desire than obligation does not appear to be positively associated with continued smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up. This suggests obligation over desire may play more of a role in sustaining quit attempts, but more data across multiple time points are needed to understand this association.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and web-based platforms were widely used to promote medicinal substances. To assess community perspectives on drug promotions on social media, we conducted qualitative research using three workshops. The workshops aimed to highlight the public understanding of drug advertising focusing on community perceptions of social media drug promotions, their risks and benefits. Discussions were conducted on the importance of adhering to national drug regulation policies and the World Health Organisation ethical criteria for promotion, advertisement, and publicity of medicines. Methods Participants for the workshops were purposively sampled from local community youth groups and healthcare facilities. Two workshops included ten young adults aged 18-35, while the third workshop involved three healthcare professionals and one traditional healer. Results The study participants’ highlighted the value of honesty and trust in the drug promotions. Gaps in the ethical conduct of advertising were observed and concerns were raised about the reliability of social media information and the omission of valuable details on the drug advertisements. Conclusion Individuals have a right to informed choices that ensure their health safety. This study has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in pharmaceutical and complementary medicine marketing on social media. Collaboration is needed between regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and community members, to make sure that drug advertising upholds ethical standards and public health.

                This research paper cites the outcomes of complex Morlet wavelet analysis, artificial intelligence techniques, thermography analysis, and SKF-Machine condition advisors for monitoring the conditions of deep groove ball bearings under several faults in different components. The complex Morlet wavelet approach is presented as a crucial technique to specify a complete picture regarding the condition of the deep groove ball bearing in conjunction with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyzer vibration data in the initial stage of the inception of the fault. Subsequently, this study implements two Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), for the identification and classification of bearing faults more effectively in a multi-fault environment. Finally, onsite condition monitoring tools such as thermal imaging cameras and machine condition advisors are found to be potential tools for the indication of defects in deep groove ball bearings in a cost-effective manner and to validate the result after a certain level of severity of the fault. The experimental results showed that the proposed system using a complex Morlet wavelet and support vector machine is effective.

                Background Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is one of the most common reproductive complications among women of childbearing age. Several factors—including genetic, anatomical, endocrine, infectious, environmental, and immunological causes—have been implicated in RSA. This study aimed to explore the potential association between RSA and the expression patterns of selected genes involved in critical biological processes related to pregnancy maintenance and miscarriage. Methods The relative expression levels of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were evaluated using peripheral blood samples from 30 women with a history of two or more spontaneous abortions (cases) and 30 age-matched non-pregnant women with no history of miscarriage and at least one successful pregnancy (controls). Results No significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of the target genes were observed between women with RSA and the control group. Conclusions Our findings suggest that peripheral blood gene expression profiles of MMP2, MMP9, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and MTHFR may not adequately reflect tissue-specific changes associated with RSA. Further investigations using relevant tissues, such as placental or decidual samples, are warranted to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RSA.

                <p>by Sultan Sevgi Turgut Ögme, Nizamettin Aydin, Zeyneb Kurt</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) analyses performed at the cellular level aim to understand the cellular landscape of tissue sections, offer insights into rare cell-types, and identify marker genes for annotating distinct cell types. ScRNAseq analyses are widely applied to cancer research to understand tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and resistance to therapy. Single-cell data processing is a challenging task due to its high-dimensionality, sparsity, and having imbalanced class(cell-type) distributions. An accurate cell-type identification is highly dependent on preprocessing and quality control steps. To address these issues, generative models have been widely used in recent years. Techniques frequently used include Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Gaussian-based methods, and, more recently, Flow-based (FB) generative models. We developed a Masked Affine Autoregressive transform-embedded FB (MAF-FB) model. Then, to improve MAF-FB further, we incorporated a mixture of experts (MOE) of attention mechanisms on top of it, resulting in our proposed MOE-FB model. We conducted a comparative analysis of fundamental generative models, aiming to serve as a preliminary guidance for developing novel automated scRNAseq data analysis systems. We performed a large-scale analysis by combiningfour datasets derived from pancreatic tissue sections and for further generalizability assessments, we employed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC68K and PBMC3K) and Human Cell Atlas Bone Marrow (HCA-BM10K) datasets. We utilized VAE, GAN, Gaussian Copula, and Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder (ACTIVA), and compared them against our two novel FB models, MAF-FB and MOE-FB for ScRnaseq synthesis. To evaluate the performances of generative models, we used various discrepancy metrics and performed automated cell-type classification tasks. We also identified differentially expressed genes for each cell type, and inferred cell-cell interactions based on ligand-receptor bindings across distinct cell-type pairs. Among the generative models, FB models, especially MOE-FB, consistently outperformed others across all experimental setups in both discrepancy metrics with comparison to the baseline test set and cell-type classification tasks (with an F1-score of 0.90 precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.92 for the integrated pancreatic datasets). MOE-FB produced biologically more relevant synthetic data, and ligand–receptor–based cell–cell interactions inferred from the synthetic cells closely resemble the original data, achieving an RMSE of 0.65 against the corresponding pancreatic test set. These findings highlight the potential and promising use of FB models, especially MOE-FB, in scRNAseq analyses.

                <p>by Marilyn Gatica, Cyril Atkinson-Clement, Carlos Coronel-Oliveros, Mohammad Alkhawashki, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Enzo Tagliazucchi, Fernando E. Rosas, Marcus Kaiser, Giovanni Petri</p>

Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation technique, offering a potential alternative to pharmacological treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. While functional analysis has been instrumental in characterizing the TUS effects, understanding its indirect influence across the network remains challenging. Here, we developed a whole-brain model to represent functional changes as measured by fMRI, enabling us to investigate how TUS-induced effects propagate throughout the brain with increasing stimulus intensity. We implemented two mechanisms: one based on anatomical distance and another on broadcasting dynamics, to explore plasticity-driven changes in specific brain regions. Finally, we highlighted the role of higher-order functional interactions in localizing spatial effects of off-line TUS at two target areas—the right thalamus and inferior frontal cortex—revealing distinct patterns of functional reorganization. This work lays the foundation for mechanistic insights and predictive models of TUS, advancing its potential clinical applications.

Emerging infectious diseases pose threats to wildlife populations, as exemplified by recent outbreaks of avian influenza viruses in wild birds. Climate change can affect infection dynamics in wildlife through direct effects on pathogens (e.g., environmental decay rates) and changes to host ecology, including shifting migration patterns. Here, we adapt an existing mechanistic model that couples migration and infection to study how traits of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses contribute to HPAI outcomes in migratory waterfowl, then apply this model to explore potential impacts of climate change on HPAI dynamics. We find that the simulated impacts of HPAI on the host population under baseline climate conditions varied from no impact to 100% mortality, depending on viral traits. In most cases, traits related to transmission (i.e., contact rates, shedding rates) were more important for HPAI establishment probability, infection prevalence, and mortality than were other viral traits (e.g., environmental temperature sensitivity, cross-protective immunity). We then simulated the effects of climate change (i.e., altered temperature regimes) on HPAI dynamics both via viral environmental decay and via changes in bird migration phenology. In these simulations, we found that a 9-day advancement in spring migration timing increased the duration of HPAI outbreaks by increasing time birds spent at their breeding grounds, leading to higher mortality and fewer infections. In contrast, increased viral decay in warmer years had a smaller, but opposite impact. These patterns depended on the primary transmission mode of HPAI (i.e., direct vs. environmental) and its sensitivity to environmental temperatures. Together, these results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the impacts of HPAI on waterfowl populations if HPAI relies strongly on direct transmission and birds advance their spring migration. Further integrating host-viral co-evolution and other climatic changes (e.g., salinity, humidity) could provide more precise predictions of how HPAI dynamics could change in the future.

Anterior–posterior axis formation in the mouse embryo requires the active migration of the DVE cell population at E5.5. While intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter line, we performed a detailed assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics between E0.5 and E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in extraembryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multicellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together, these results reveal the pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior–posterior axis formation.

                <p>by Thomas J. Stoll, Nathan D. Vandjelovic, Melissa J. Polonenko, Nadja R. S. Li, Adrian K. C. Lee, Ross K. Maddox</p>

The ability to pick out and attend to one sound in a noisy mixture underpins successful communication in many natural scenarios. Selective attention has been shown to drastically alter sound encoding in the cortex and has been hypothesized to modulate subcortical processing via an extensive efferent network. The body of work investigating this possibility in humans has not resulted in a clear consensus, possibly owing to limitations in the available methodologies. Here, we used new experimental tools that allowed distinct neural responses from across the auditory pathway to be simultaneously acquired from human listeners attending to the sound of one person talking while ignoring a second. Our series of experiments provide convergent evidence that selective attention does not influence sound encoding in the auditory periphery or brainstem, with an effect first appearing in the cortex. Humans’ ability to focus their attention on a single sound even in the presence of many others is as remarkable as it is essential. These findings add needed clarity regarding the mechanisms that make this feat possible.

                In this datanote we present data from 31 iRBD (idiopathic Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder) patients followed throughout three years to assess their eventual phenoconversion to Parkinson’s disease and other established neurodegenerative conditions. iRBD is a prodromal condition of neurological pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. We evaluated transcription factor mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells as predictive biomarkers of phenoconversion in iRBD, showing that among the transcription factors mRNA levels analysed, STAT1, GATA3 and FOXP3 mRNA levels may be used to predict phenoconversion. In particular, we found that CD4+ T cells from converters had higher STAT1, and lower GATA3 and FOXP3 mRNA levels. According to ROC curve analysis STAT1 levels provided a good discrimination, GATA3 levels an excellent discrimination of future converters and not-converters, while discrimination provided by FOXP3 levels was acceptable.

                Background We have little knowledge about the synchronous occurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and other types of histologic tumors. This association is very rare. Case presentation We describe a case of synchronous stromal tumor and adenocarcinoma of the left side colonic localization. Immunohistochemistry identified c-Kit expression. The discovery of colonic adenocarcinoma was on operative specimen after histologic examination. The patient underwent left oncologic colectomy with stoma. Follow-up at one year postoperatively did not detect tumor recurrence. Discussion Clinical implications of the association between these two neoplasms are not clearly described. Treatment depends on the the most aggressive histologic type or obviously highest stage. Knowledge of the genetic data of this association offers opportunity of treatment with the new targeted-therapy molecules. Surgical resection, may remain the curative treatment. Conclusions Synchronous adenocarcinoma and GIST has been more commonly described in the stomach.  The pathogeneses of tumorigenesis may not be the same for the two tumors. More studies seem be necessary to clarify a potential role of different genes in the development of adenocarcinomas. And therefore, above all their therapeutic implications.

                Background Environmental degradation, which is the deterioration of ecological quality due to increased unsustainable economic activities, is a global concern that poses a threat to humanity. Like many African countries, Namibia is severely affected by environmental degradation, an arid, lower-middle-income country in sub-Saharan Africa with 16 percent land covered by desert. Therefore, understanding the dynamics between financial development, institutional quality, and environmental quality. Methods This study examines the impact of financial development and institutional quality on environmental quality in Namibia, using time series data spanning the period from 1990 and 2023. The study used ARDL approach to examine the short and long run relationship. Results The findings show that institutional quality increases environmental degradation, aligning with the notion that climate change is not a result of only economic activities, but also a result of weak institutions. However, financial sector development often supports novel and sophisticated investment products and preserves the environment. Conclusion Therefore, this study recommended that Namibia make collaborative efforts to implement effective regulations to strengthen the role of institutions and support financial innovation to address environmental degradation. Additionally, encouragement of environmental, societal, and governance (ESG) led business investments is needed.

                Background Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a critical barrier in assisted reproductive technology, affecting a significant subset of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematically review and analyze the causes and treatments of RIF, providing evidence-based insights to enhance clinical management. Methods PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched for articles published up to February 29, 2024. Studies were selected if they involved human subjects undergoing IVF, reported pregnancy outcomes, and addressed embryonic or extraembryonic factors influencing implantation. A total of 4,380 articles were screened, and 75 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were pooled using fixed and random effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I2, τ2, and Cochran's Q test. Key factors analyzed included embryo euploidy, uterine abnormalities, thyroid function, and chronic endometritis, while treatments evaluated included antibiotics, heparin, platelet-rich plasma, and assisted hatching. Results Meta-analyses revealed that embryo euploidy significantly improves the odds of clinical pregnancy, while untreated hydrosalpinx and chronic endometritis significantly decreases the odds of pregnancy. Effective interventions include antibiotics for chronic endometritis, hysteroscopy for uterine abnormalities, and heparin for specific coagulation disorders. Other treatments, such as platelet-rich plasma and assisted hatching, require further evidence. Conclusions RIF management demands a tailored approach, emphasizing comprehensive diagnostics and personalized interventions. Despite the growing recognition of RIF, inconsistencies in its definition and limited high-quality evidence for certain treatments remain challenging. Further research is essential to standardize protocols and improve outcomes.

                Background The functions of pavement-markings are to safely and smoothly guide drivers and vehicles along a road-lane, alert drivers not to leave the lane, and provide traffic information. These functions are directly related to the safety and economy of passengers and vehicles on roads. The visibility of pavement-markings is linked to surface damage during the daytime and is significantly affected by luminance at night. Therefore, damage and luminance should be considered key-factors for maintenance and should be measured in detail. In Seoul, mobile equipment such as image-scanners and damage-detectors has been used to measure damage conditions, and a luminance measurement vehicle has been introduced to observe reflected light intensity from road-markings. The mobile measurement methods are respectively utilized due to their objective difference of the measurement. However, measurement discrepancies in temporal, locational, and environmental conditions can lead to considerable errors. Moreover, a standardized maintenance index is currently lacking for planning repair work in Seoul. In that regards, one objective of this research was to develop a retroreflectivity prediction model using a vehicle that detects pavement and marking damage. Method The model enables the prediction of retroreflectivity without additional measurement equipment. Another objective was to develop degradation models based on the age of pavement-markings and to evaluate their performance for maintenance and budget planning. Results As a result, a regression model was determined to be the optimal predictive model for retroreflectivity. A logarithmic model was selected to predict retroreflectivity degradation. Additionally, the Seoul-Road-Marking-Index was developed. Conclusion The developed models are expected to assist in establishing maintenance plans, formulating budgets, and determining repair work, as well as developing relevant regulations and standards in Seoul.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to compare the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20–40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of periodontopathogens and the amount of nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected, DNA was isolated, the entire 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, and sample libraries were prepared in accordance to the Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology procedure. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity in saliva samples that were pooled according to three groups; T2DM patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3), was measured using bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the relationships between the periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium spp.) and denitrifying community (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, and Veillonella) were assessed. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (gingivitis, G2; periodontitis, G3) showed more bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to alpha-diversity analysis (p < 0.0001). The G3 group exhibited the largest abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen. Additionally, we discovered that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different interactions. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that, with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93 (p = 0.04), the connection between Fusobacterium spp. and Neisseria was a powerful indicator for distinguishing between gingivitis and periodontitis. Conclusion Results of this study show that the connection between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These features may be crucial markers for the early detection and management of gingivitis to avoid periodontitis.

                Background Among the key factors for cross-country skier training are high altitude training and strength in double-polling, because has recently been used not only for long-distance races but also for World cup. This study aimed to identify the effects of artificially induced high altitude on acute performance changes during aerobic (AE) and anaerobic (ANE) threshold exercises. Sport-specific tests simulating double-poling cross-country skiing were performed. Methods Eleven (8 ♂ and 3 ♀) highly trained cross-country skiers (age 19±2.81, BMI 21.9±2.1) performed a stress test to determine individual AE and ANE levels and AE and ANE intensity tests at low (500 m ASL) and artificially induced high (2000 m ASL) altitudes. The altitude was simulated using the hypoxic generator HYP-100™. For double-poling, the ergometer SkiErg® was used in the standing position. Heart rate (HR) and lactate concentration (LC) in the capillary blood were monitored. Results For the AE and ANE loads, the average HR values at an artificially induced high altitude were 3–5% higher than those at a low altitude. The differences were significant, both statistically (p<0.05) and substantively. The average LC values were neither statistically significant (p>0.05) nor substantively significant. Conclusions Not-adapted youth elite cross-country skiers have higher HR at artificially induced high altitudes (2000 m ASL) during the test on SkiErg® compare to the same load in lowland (500 m ASL). The absence of alterations in the average LC confirms that it is more appropriate to monitor the HR for altitude acute effect assessment and employ LC only for verification. For the management of endurance sports training at high altitude our research confirmed that exercise must respect the principles of acclimatization processes.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70040?af=R">Drug‐Related Engrams and Their Role in the Persistence and Recurrence of Drug‐Related Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memory is a cornerstone of human behavior, and addiction offers a compelling model of its persistence and plasticity. The scope of engram research has rapidly expanded to include addiction-related phenomena. Addiction-related memories, like strong aversive memories, are often highly resistant to extinction and can continue to drive relapse long after drug use has ceased. These enduring behavioral effects suggest that drug engrams, sparsely distributed neural ensembles encoding drug-associated experiences, are stabilized by powerful synaptic and molecular plasticity. At the same time, their very malleability may hold the key to developing new treatments. This minireview synthesizes emerging findings on drug engrams, highlighting the specialized circuits, molecular mechanisms, and behavioral consequences tied to addiction-related memory traces. We focus on how engram tagging and reactivation techniques have revealed addiction-specific ensembles across several brain regions and important pathways that promote or attenuate drug-seeking behavior. We also discuss how direct manipulation of drug engrams may hold promise for weakening the influence of drug-associated cues and other relapse triggers, while enhancing protective circuits to reduce relapse risk. Still, fundamental questions remain such as how do drug engrams evolve during the transition from recreational use to addiction? Addressing these questions will be critical for developing circuit-informed, lasting interventions that target the memory systems sustaining addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00184-5?rss=yes">Foraging as an ethological framework for neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                The study of foraging is central to a renewed interest in naturalistic behavior in neuroscience. Applying a foraging framework grounded in behavioral ecology has enabled probing of the mechanisms underlying cognitive processes such as decision-making within a more ecological context. Yet, foraging also involves myriad other aspects, including navigation of complex environments, sensory processing, and social interactions. Here, we first provide a brief overview of the neuroscience of foraging decisions, and then combine insights from behavioral ecology and neuroscience to review the role of these additional dimensions of foraging. We conclude by highlighting four opportunities for the continued development of foraging as an ethological framework for neuroscience: integrating normative and implementation-level models, developing new tools, enabling cross-species comparisons, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

">HCN channel currents underlie distinct neurophysiology of mediodorsal thalamus subnuclei</a></h4>

              
                The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a hub coordinating cortical and subcortical brain regions to support execu-tive and social/emotional functioning. MD can be subdivided into medial (M), central (C), and lateral (L) based on synaptic coupling, molecular identity, and physiology. Recently, we identified differential intrinsic properties be-tween thalamocortical M and L neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). L neurons projecting to mPFC showed increased hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channel activity compared with M neurons, which caused L neurons to have lower cellular resistance and shorter time windows for integration of inputs. In addition to their role in synaptic integration, HCN channels are critical for thalamic rhythm generation. In this study, we used a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and in situ hybridization to investigate how differences in HCN impact intrinsic oscillatory dynamics in M, C, and L neurons. We found that HCN current (Ih) differed across MD subnuclei with C > L >> M. Clustering neurons based on HCN properties was sufficient to classify subnuclei with >95% accuracy, highlighting the differences in HCN function between sub-nuclei. Greater HCN activity in MD neurons was associated with decreased input resistance, decreased action potential firing, and higher resonant frequency. These findings provide an ionic basis for differences in cellular resonance across MD subnuclei, with implications for thalamic rhythm generation and information processing.

">Evolution towards higher unitary conductance in mammals makes BK channels more efficient and precise</a></h4>

              
                The large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, known as the BK channel, play an essential role in neuronal firing and is characterized by a very large ~250pS unitary conductance in mammals. However, this high unitary conductance is not consistent across all species with invertebrates demonstrating a much lower unitary conductance. We explored the calcium activation properties of BK channels of different unitary conductance in computational models and found that mammalian channels are more efficiently activated by calcium and produce a stronger potassium current compared to the channels of lower unitary conductance found in invertebrates. The lower unitary conductance channels display fierce competition for the available calcium, which results in low activation and weaker current. Due to these properties, mammalian BK channels are more suitable to repolarize sodium action potentials, which enables more precise spike timing, and may explain why evolution appears to have favored a trend towards very high unitary conductance in mammalian BK channels. This may be an essential component of the more advanced brain functions achieved by these species compared to invertebrates.

">A Dual Inhibitory Network in the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus Delineated by Pallidal and Intra-Reticular Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Long described as an inhibitory "guardian of the gateway," the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) shapes which thalamic signals reach the cortex during attention, arousal, and sensory processing. However, how the inhibitory wiring within TRN supports this flexible gating--from modality-specific tuning to global control--remains poorly defined. Using cell type-specific optogenetic input mapping and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mice, we dissect inhibitory connectivity in TRN from two major GABAergic sources: the TRN itself and the external globus pallidus (GPe). All recorded TRN neurons received inhibition from the GPe, whereas a subset also received intra-TRN inhibition. Intra-TRN inhibition arose predominantly from somatostatin-expressing onto parvalbumin-expressing TRN neurons (SOM[-&gt;]PV), revealing subtype-specific connectivity recruited by thalamic excitation to form a feedforward motif. These findings delineate a dual inhibitory architecture: local intra-TRN circuits provide spatially selective inhibition, whereas pallidal inputs deliver diffuse inhibition. These complementary mechanisms may support both modality-specific gating and global state-dependent control of thalamic output.

">Sequential development of task representation from hippocampus to prefrontal cortex supports goal-directed spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                Successful goal-directed navigation requires the coordination between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. However, it is not fully confirmed that the medial prefrontal cortex learns its spatial code from the hippocampus. To test this, we examined spatial representations of the intermediate hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex while rats learned a spatial navigation task. Rats performed a goal-directed spatial navigation task in 2D VR to find an unmarked goal zone, and we discovered robust directional tuning of single neurons in both regions. Neural manifold analysis further confirmed population-level directional tuning in both regions, with manifolds having ring-like geometry. We found that this ring-like structure evolved after learning, in a way that the hippocampal-prefrontal manifolds converged to a shared geometry. Furthermore, this evolution of ring-like structure was preceded by the hippocampus at the trial level. It was further verified that the evolution of the ring-like structure is linked to phase locking to the hippocampal theta rhythm, particularly in the prefrontal manifolds. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spatial representations of the hippocampal-prefrontal network become aligned after learning, and also highlight the information flow from the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex during this geometry synchronization.

">Impacts of perinatal factors on white matter outcome at 8 to 10 years by diffusion tensor imaging</a></h4>

              
                Background: While perinatal factors are known to influence brain development, their long-term impact on white matter microstructure remains incompletely understood. Previous studies using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) have shown limited associations between neonatal measures and later white matter development. Methods: We investigated associations between perinatal factors (birth weight [BW], gestational age [GA], and head circumference [HC]) and white matter microstructure in 117 children aged 8-10 years from the UNC Early Brain Development Study cohort. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed using a fiber tract-based framework examining 54 major white matter tracts. Statistical analysis was performed using a functional analysis of fiber tract profiles. Results: GA and BW showed widespread significant associations with white matter microstructure (38 and 36 out of 54 tracts, respectively), while HC showed limited associations (3 out of 54 tracts). Post-hoc univariate analysis revealed stronger associations with axial diffusivity (AD) compared to radial diffusivity (RD) or fractional anisotropy (FA). AD associations with BW, GA, and HC were found in 30, 31, and 8 tracts, respectively. Conclusions: Using a fiber tract-based analysis approach, we demonstrated that GA and BW are strongly predictive of white matter organization at school age, while HC showed limited predictive power. The predominant associations with AD suggest these perinatal factors primarily influence axonal organization rather than myelination. These findings enhance our understanding of how early life factors impact long-term brain development.

">Rapidly Reconfigurable Dynamic Computing in Neural Networks with Fixed Synaptic Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory in the brain's neocortex have long been hypothesised to be primarily mediated by synaptic plasticity. Extensive research in artificial neural networks has shown that training networks by adjusting connection weights faces computational challenges, including large parameter spaces and the tendency of new learning to interfere with previous learning (catastrophic forgetting). We propose that the brain, which is resistant to these challenges, can also learn by modulating the excitability of each neuron in a network rather than changing synaptic strengths. We show here that learning a task-specific set of bias currents enables a feedforward or recurrent network with fixed and randomly assigned connections to perform well on and switch between dozens of tasks, including regression, classification, autonomous time series generation, a game and robotic control. Bias-only learning also provides a novel mechanistic explanation for representational drift. It directly links the noise robustness of neuronal representations on short and long time scales to the ability of neural circuits to preserve learned information while remaining adaptable. We postulate that subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia or cerebellum, may provide similar bias inputs to the neocortex for rapid task learning and robustness against interference.

">Hedonic experiences emerge from an orchestrated balance of synergistic and redundant information processing</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine exerts rapid-acting, pro-hedonic effects, yet its precise mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present behavioral and fMRI data from a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in 38 healthy participants investigating ketamine's sub-acute effects on multivariate information-processing during music-evoked peak hedonic experiences. Leveraging information-theoretical measures, our findings indicate that hedonic experiences depend on a distinct global (as measured by O-Information) and local (as measured by integrated information) balance between redundant - information shared across nodes - and synergistic - information emerging from joint interactions - processes. As hedonic intensity rises, neural dynamics shift toward greater synergy; with the one exception of a deliberate increase in redundancy particularly for key sensory information to ensure reliable transmission of and access to critical external information for subsequent hedonic processing. In contrast, ketamine's sub-acute pro-hedonic effects arise potentially from enhancing redundant dynamics at rest, boosting the brain's capability to robustly represent and access critical internal information, and thus, fostering an environment optimized to amplify the phenomenological hedonic experience, while simultaneously allowing for more efficient information integration.

">A molecular convergence in the triad of Parkinson's disease, depressive disorder and gut health is revealed by the inflammation-miRNA axis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder frequently comorbid with non-motor symptoms like depressive disorder (DD) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Chronic neuroinflammation and disruption of the gut-brain axis are implicated as shared pathological drivers, but the precise molecular mechanisms connecting these conditions remain elusive. We hypothesized that a common microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inflammatory profile underlies this clinical triad, representing a point of pathological convergence. Methods: We analyzed the expression of a panel of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated miRNAs, key inflammatory markers, and glial response in postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) from patients with PD, DD, and matched healthy controls. To investigate causality and gut-brain axis involvement, two mouse models were used: (i) PD-associated -synucleinopathy was induced in dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) neurons; and (ii) DD-like based on corticosterone (CORT)-induced stress. Mice were assessed for depressive-like behaviors and GI dysmotility, and their brain (medial prefrontal cortex and caudate-putamen) and ileum tissues were analyzed for the same molecular markers. Results: We identified a conserved miRNA pattern in the brains of both PD and DD patients, characterized by the significant downregulation of miR-199a-5p and miR-219a-5p and the upregulation of miR-200a-3p. This dysregulation was strongly associated with a pro-inflammatory state, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-{gamma}, and NF{kappa}B1, as well as changes in the glial response. Mice with -synucleinopathy in the 5-HT system exhibited a depression-like phenotype and reduced intestinal motility, accompanied by increased Iba1 and GFAP signal. Comparable effects were observed in mice subjected to CORT-induced stress. Notably, the same pattern of miRNAs and inflammatory cytokines observed in the human brain was replicated in the brain and ileum of DD-PD-like mice, providing direct evidence of a parallel pathological process spanning the gut-brain axis. Conclusion: This study identifies a specific miRNA-inflammatory axis as a common molecular mechanism connecting the pathophysiology of PD, DD, and gut dysfunction. This pattern represents a critical point of convergence that drives a shared, bidirectional inflammatory cascade along the gut-brain axis. Targeting this miRNA triad could provide a new therapeutic approach for addressing the motor, psychiatric, and GI symptoms of these interconnected disorders simultaneously.

">Synaptic histamine shapes the neurocomputational dynamics of human learning</a></h4>

              
                Histamine was the first canonical monoamine identified in the mammalian brain 1-6, yet arguably remains the least understood in its mechanistic contributions to human behaviour. Using a first-in-class causal probe (H3R inverse agonist pitolisant), we show how increased synaptic histamine shapes offline and online temporal-hippocampal dynamics, sustaining learning-related activity and polarising retrieval computations. At a broader level, elevated histamine adaptively shifts neurocomputational strategy under high cognitive load, while stabilising value updates during aversive reinforcement learning. These findings uncover a mechanistically grounded influence of this underexplored system on human neurocomputation, supporting its therapeutic potential in psychiatry.

">Effective computations for hippocampal place cell phenomena in sparse untrained random networks</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain processes experience-dependent spatial information through poorly-understood network mechanisms thought to depend on particular network connectivity patterns and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, dedicated input connections that learn to shape information about place cannot easily explain many rodent hippocampal place cell phenomena. For example, representational drift notwithstanding, the discharge of each place cell maps to specific locations in a fixed environment, but the discharge of most cells remap to distinct independent locations across environments, despite the fact that most sub-second cofiring relationships amongst hippocampal neuron pairs persist across environments. Whereas some models of hippocampal spatial information processing rely on the dedicated input connections of a for-purpose connectome (ignoring remapping, representational drift, and maintained cofiring), other models use synaptic plasticity implemented by learning rules to alter random input connections, but struggle with either limited capacity, representational drift, and/or biological implausibility. Here, using a randomly tuned network with feedback inhibition, we examine whether the assumptions of a specific connectome and learning-implemented synaptic plasticity are necessary for diverse place cell phenomena. We find that the random network with non-plastic connections accounts for positional tuning, single place fields in small spaces and multiple place fields in large spaces, mixed selectivity, and remapping, amongst other place cell phenomena. This requires excitatory activity to be sparse and organized across stimuli by divisive normalization. Enabling synaptic plasticity only at the network connections (not at network inputs) accounts for additional place cell phenomena including overdispersion, representational drift, and memory tagging. We show by simulations and analytically that DivSparse, a random network with sparsifying inhibition can explain many features of place cell network activity, suggesting that simple biologically-plausible architectures can realize representations of spatial experience that are robust, flexible, and spontaneous.

">Cold sensing by a glutamate receptor drives avoidance behavior in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                The ability to sense and avoid noxious environments is essential for animal survival; yet, how this is achieved at the behavioral, neuronal, and molecular levels is not well understood. Here, we use Drosophila larvae as a model to investigate how animals sense and avoid cold temperatures. By implementing custom-built thermoelectric devices capable of delivering rapid and precise thermal stimuli, we find that cold delivered to the larval head evokes robust escape behavioral responses. We identify a group of head-located cold-sensitive neurons as necessary and sufficient for such avoidance responses. We further demonstrate that the kainate-type glutamate receptor Clumsy acts as a novel cold sensor required for head cold sensitivity. Knockdown of Clumsy in head cold-sensing neurons suppresses their cold sensitivity. Heterologous expression of Clumsy confers cold sensitivity. Our results show that Drosophila larvae have evolved the capacity to detect and avoid cold temperatures through a previously uncharacterized cold-sensing mechanism.

">Mixture models for domain-adaptive brain decoding</a></h4>

              
                A grand challenge in brain decoding is to develop algorithms that generalize across multiple subjects and tasks. Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.

">V1 interlaminar coherence decreases with interocular conflict</a></h4>

              
                Resolving conflicting input from the two eyes is a fundamental challenge for the visual system. In the primary visual cortex (V1), such interocular conflict induces modest suppression of single neuron spiking, but the accompanying population-level dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we examined laminar multi-unit activity and interlaminar local field potential (LFP) coherence in macaque V1 during dichoptic stimulation and binocular rivalry flash suppression (BRFS). From laminar microelectrode recordings, we found that interocular conflict reliably reduces interlaminar coherence, particularly between granular and infragranular layers, suggesting altered temporal coordination across the cortical column. Strikingly, during BRFS, coherence remained reduced even when firing rates were unchanged. Moreover, interlaminar coherence is higher for perceptually dominant BRFS stimuli, indicating that coherence across V1 layers covaries with perceptual outcome in the absence of significant firing-rate differences. These findings show that the temporal dynamics of population coherence are a more stable signal of interocular conflict than spike rate modulation.

">Convergent information flows explain recurring firing patterns in cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical population events, short-lived patterns of neuronal activity that recur with some consistency, are central to sensorimotor coordination. These reproducible firing patterns are often attributed to attractor dynamics, supported by strong mutual connectivity. However, using multi-modal datasets - including 2-photon imaging, electrophysiology, and electron microscopy - we show that these reproducible patterns do not involve strongly interconnected neurons. Instead, we show that cortical networks exhibit hierarchical modularity, with core neurons acting as high-information-flow nodes positioned at module interfaces. These cores funnel activity but lack structural signatures of pattern completion units expected in an attractor network. Using computational models, we find that distance-dependent connectivity is necessary and sufficient to generate the modularity and transient reproducible events observed in cortex. Our findings suggest that cortical networks are instead pre-configured to support sensorimotor coordination. This work redefines the structural and dynamical basis of cortical activity, highlighting the link between modular structure and function.

">XIST Self-regulates its Association with THOC2 and the Nuclear Epigenetic Machinery via miR-186 in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows a female bias, with about two-thirds of cases occurring in women; however, the underlying reasons remain unclear. This study uncovers the role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in driving female-specific AD pathology. Analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human AD cortical tissues and in vitro AD models reveal a notable increase and abnormal cytoplasmic localization of XIST, a phenomenon not previously observed in neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, altered EZH2 levels dampen the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on the inactive X chromosome, disrupting epigenetic silencing. This dysregulation impacts the RNA export factor subunit THOC2, whose levels are also elevated in AD. Cytoplasmic XIST acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-186-5p, rescuing EZH2 and THOC2 transcripts. This creates a positive feedback loop that sustains both nuclear epigenetic machinery and cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation by XIST. The miR-186/EZH2/THOC2/XIST axis offers a molecular framework for understanding the female-biased vulnerability in AD, linking XIST-driven epigenetic changes with nuclear RNA export pathways via cytoplasmic XIST. Disrupted EZH2-XIST interaction reduces H3K27me3 marks on the inactive X chromosome, while increased THOC2 promotes THOC2 (TREX) binding to XIST, maintaining the harmful feedback. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism through which XIST gets recruited to the nuclear export pathways in AD. These results position XIST as a key epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulator in female AD pathophysiology and suggest it could be a target for sex-specific therapeutic interventions.

">Dissecting novel object exploration: a fully automated homecage-based novel object recognition test</a></h4>

              
                The novel object recognition test is a frequently used memory test in rodents. Due to its ethological nature, cross-species relevance, and specificity to testing hippocampal and parahippocampal function, it has been widely applied in basic and translational research. However, its implementation proves challenging due to multiple uncontrolled factors. Here, we describe a fully automated homecage-based novel object recognition test for assessing long-term object memory in mice. We present an empirically guided computational model to show the robustness of this approach despite ambiguity in defining exploratory behaviours. We show that mice preferentially explored novel compared to familiar objects after 24-hour and 7-day retention periods, starting to discern them while still a distance away. The findings were replicated across two facilities. Furthermore, the ability to recognise the novel object depends on the mouses prior interactions with the replaced object after 24 hours, but not after 7 days. Finally, we showed that external factors may introduce undesired exploration biases, which can be addressed using relative instead of absolute discrimination measures. The fully automated homecage-based object recognition test will improve standardisation, rigour, and reproducibility, as well as expand our understanding of the factors influencing object exploratory behaviours and object memory.

">Trait motivation is associated with Fusiform face area Morphometry Evidence from a Chinese Youth Sample</a></h4>

              
                Trait motivation is fundamental in shaping human behaviors. Previous studies have primarily focused on their impact on affective and motivational processing, with their role in perceptual processes less investigated. The present study takes face perception, a crucial and well-studied perceptual process, as a representative specimen to examine the perceptual effect of trait motivation. We investigated whether the behavioral activation system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) were associated with structural characteristics of the inferior temporal face-selective regions as well as face recognition performance. With a sample of Chinese young adults (N = 264), voxel-based morphometry revealed that BIS scores correlated with greater gray matter volume in the fusiform face area. Further, a higher BIS score was associated with slightly better performance in face recognition. These findings provide novel evidence that trait motivation, particularly behavioral inhibition, is linked to both the structure and function of the face processing system. This underlines the intrinsic coupling between motivational and perceptual systems, blurring the presumed divide between affective and perceptual processes.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dyslexia is a neurobiological disorder characterized by reading difficulties, yet its causes remain unclear. Neuroimaging and behavioral studies found anomalous responses in tasks requiring phonological processing, motion perception, and implicit learning, and showed gray and white matter abnormalities in dyslexics compared to controls, indicating that dyslexia is highly heterogeneous and promoting a multifactorial approach. To evaluate whether combining behavioral and multimodal MRI improves sensitivity in identifying dyslexia neurocognitive traits compared to monocomponential approaches, 19 dyslexic and 19 control subjects underwent cognitive assessments, multiple (phonological, visual motion, rhythmic) mismatch-response functional MRI tasks, structural diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T1-weighted imaging. Between group differences in the neurocognitive measures were tested with univariate and multivariate approaches. Results showed that dyslexics performed worse than controls in phonological tasks and presented reduced cerebellar responses to mismatching rhythmic stimuli, as well as structural disorganization in white matter tracts and cortical regions. Most importantly, a machine learning model trained with features from all three MRI modalities discriminated between dyslexics and controls with greater accuracy than single-modality models. The individual classification scores in the multimodal machine learning model correlated with behavioral reading accuracy. These results characterize dyslexia as a composite condition with multiple distinctive cognitive and brain traits.</span>

                In a recent study, Goueytes and colleagues combined computational modeling with intracranial recordings to dissect the neural basis of confidence and changes of mind. They reveal a temporally organized, spatially distributed hierarchy of evidence accumulation, with pre-decisional signals in the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and post-decisional signals in the insula. This reframes metacognition as a distributed and dynamic process.

                The brain constantly generates predictions based on one’s knowledge of the world, as captured in memory. When these predictions are in error, our knowledge base must be revised to remain relevant. Here, we propose that this error-driven updating of memory depends largely on the interplay between the hippocampus and locus coeruleus (LC), during which the former conveys information about surprise to the latter, signaling the magnitude of prediction error. Small prediction errors promote editing of existing memories, whereas large prediction errors lead to the formation of new episodic memories. We suggest that this memory curation process is central to adaptive behavior, extending classical views on the contributions of the LC to cognition.

                Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study compared survival among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients between September 2019 and June 2021. Of these, 404 received standard palliative pain management (ST), and 87 received medicinal cannabis treatment (CT). Patients were enrolled from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. Cumulative survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression. Results For ST patients, follow-up time was 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients, follow-up time was 476 person-months, with a mortality rate of 10.9/100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed CT was significantly associated with prolonged survival (HRadj = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20–0.37; p < 0.001). Conclusions The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients. In this retrospective cohort, Medicinal cannabis treatment was associated with more prolonged survival among advanced CCA patients in Northeastern Thailand. While this association remained significant after multivariable adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounding factors may have influenced the observed outcomes. Although the association remained significant after adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounders may have influenced outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanisms.

                Background Postoperative immobilization in patients with lower extremity fractures frequently leads to constipation, affecting approximately 50–70% of patients. Non-pharmacological nursing interventions such as Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are potential approaches to alleviate this problem. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy in reducing constipation scores among patients with postoperative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre–posttest design without a control group was conducted with 30 respondents selected using a simple random sampling technique. Constipation was assessed using the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) before and after intervention. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, and results were interpreted with attention to baseline differences between groups. Results Both interventions significantly reduced constipation scores. The mean post-intervention CAS score was 4.60 in the warm water group and 3.56 in the Swedish abdominal massage group (p < 0.001). Although Swedish abdominal massage showed a greater within-group reduction, baseline imbalances in constipation scores may have influenced the observed differences. Conclusion Swedish abdominal massage and warm water therapy are effective nurse-led, non-pharmacological interventions for reducing postoperative constipation. The findings should be interpreted cautiously due to baseline differences and small sample size. Future research with larger samples, controlled designs, and statistical adjustments is recommended to confirm these preliminary findings.

                Background It is imperative to deliver exceptional services in order to improve patient contentment and cultivate enduring loyalty in the healthcare sector, which is becoming more competitive. The direct impact of leadership and governance on patient experience and retention remains underexplored, despite the increasing recognition of their role in determining care delivery. This investigation investigates the connections between healthcare organizations’ corporate governance, service quality, patient satisfaction, and loyalty, as well as entrepreneurial leadership. Methods Data were obtained from 384 executive patients in hospitals throughout Indonesia using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results The findings indicate that corporate governance and service quality are considerably improved by entrepreneurial leadership, while patient satisfaction and loyalty are positively impacted by corporate governance. Nevertheless, patient satisfaction was found to be moderately influenced by service quality, while patient loyalty was significantly influenced. As a result, patient satisfaction was demonstrated to be a critical factor in the development of patient loyalty. These results emphasize the importance of high service quality, effective governance, and entrepreneurial leadership in promoting patient satisfaction and loyalty. Conclusions The research offers valuable insights for healthcare managers and policymakers who are interested in enhancing organizational performance and improving patient retention. This research theoretically enhances comprehension of the impact of leadership and governance frameworks on patient retention and service quality. In practical terms, it provides valuable recommendations for hospital administrators and policymakers to improve patient satisfaction and loyalty by implementing effective leadership, robust governance, and continuous service improvement.

                Introduction With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), its integration into medical fields has gained momentum. AI is increasingly applied for diagnosing and managing temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), affecting one of the most complex joints in the body. This review aims to highlight the AI-driven approaches in diagnosing and treating TMD. Methods A comprehensive literature search conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on English-language studies published since 2007. References from relevant articles were also examined. Results A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI applications in TMD. These studies included AI-driven medical image segmentation (3), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (3), temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) detection (4), Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articular disc displacements and deformities (5), decision support systems (5), and AI-based sound analysis for TMJ assessment (1). The findings suggest that AI, particularly deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques, has demonstrated promising accuracy in detecting and classifying TMD and its related pathologies. AI automates segmentation, improves diagnostic consistency, and assists clinicians through predictive modeling. Discussion Despite advancements, challenges remain, as many studies rely on small datasets, limiting generalizability. The absence of standardized evaluation metrics and external validation hinders clinical adoption. Ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and workflow integration pose additional barriers. Future research should focus on larger datasets, model interpretability, and rigorous clinical validation. Conclusion AI is emerging as a valuable tool in TMD diagnosis and management, promising improved accuracy and efficiency, but further development is essential for real-world implementation.

                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumstances often faces non-adherence. Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, has shown promising efficacy against Mycobacterium leprae in in-vitro and in-vivo studies, therefore accelerates bacterial clearance. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                Objective The rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, predictive of type 2 diabetes, relates largely to increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyle, but also to early metabolic life events. Considering the consequences on health of developing MetS in young adulthood, the objective of this study is to better characterize and understand MetS phenotypes in a young adult born with small weight for gestational age (SGA). Methods A nested case-control study is designed within the French community-based Haguenau cohort, including 92 male and female young SGA adults divided into cases (with MetS at follow-up, n=46) and controls (free of MetS, n=46), matched for age and sex, all free of MetS at baseline. Serum metabolic signatures will be first determined at the end of follow-up (30 years of age) to characterise phenotypes related to MetS using an untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomic approach. Results will be compared to those obtained in a population of adults born with adequate weight for gestational age (AGA), matched for age and sex, to reveal the specific part of phenotypes related to the imprint of the foetal environment. Lastly, the baseline signatures (20 y.o.) will be identified to explore early dysfunctions around 10 years before diagnosis and evaluate the capacities of serum metabolites to predict evolution towards MetS in SGA. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the University of Paris-St Louis, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Research findings will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and at national and international conferences with domain-specific societies, to researchers, clinicians, and policy markers sharing findings. This project was supported by the ‘Fondation Francophone de Recherche sur le Diabète’.

                Background Digital transformation in banking is accelerating, yet internal adoption of key applications remains suboptimal. BRISPOT is a digital credit system used by relationship managers (RMs) in the SME segment of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). Methods Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) integrated with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this quantitative study surveyed 150 RMs. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly affected behavioral intention to use BRISPOT. Behavioral intention had a strong influence on actual usage. However, trust did not moderate the intention–use relationship. Conclusions The integration of UTAUT and SCT offers a robust explanation of digital adoption behavior among internal users. System usability and institutional support are critical for driving adoption. Trust, while conceptually important, may be context-dependent.

                <p>by Hongru Du, Matthew V. Zahn, Sara L. Loo, Tijs W. Alleman, Shaun Truelove, Bryan Patenaude, Lauren M. Gardner, Nicholas Papageorge, Alison L. Hill</p>

Human behavior plays a crucial role in infectious disease transmission, yet traditional models often overlook or oversimplify this factor, limiting predictions of disease spread and the associated socioeconomic impacts. Here we introduce a feedback-informed epidemiological model that integrates human behavior with disease dynamics in a credible, tractable, and extendable manner. From economics, we incorporate a dynamic decision-making model where individuals assess the trade-off between disease risks and economic consequences, and then link this to a risk-stratified compartmental model of disease spread taken from epidemiology. In the unified framework, heterogeneous individuals make choices based on current and future payoffs, influencing their risk of infection and shaping population-level disease dynamics. As an example, we model disease-decision feedback during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the decision to participate in paid, in-person work was a major determinant of disease risk. Comparing the impacts of stylized policy options representing mandatory, incentivized/compensated, and voluntary work abstention, we find that accounting for disease-behavior feedback has a significant impact on the relative health and economic impacts of policies. Including two crucial dimensions of heterogeneity—health and economic vulnerability—the results highlight how inequities between risk groups can be exacerbated or alleviated by disease control measures. Importantly, we show that a policy of more stringent workplace testing can potentially slow virus spread and, surprisingly, increase labor supply since individuals otherwise inclined to remain at home to avoid infection perceive a safer workplace. In short, our framework permits the exploration of avenues whereby health and wealth need not always be at odds. This flexible and extendable modeling framework offers a powerful tool for understanding the interplay between human behavior and disease spread.

                <p>by Théo Pinettes, Quentin J Leclerc, Kévin Jean, Laura Temime</p>

Nosocomial infections of both patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals may play an important part in the overall dynamics of a viral pandemic, as evidenced by the recent COVID-19 experience. A strategy to control this risk consists in dedicating some hospitals to the care of infected patients only, with HCWs alternating between shifts of continuous stay within these hospitals and periods of isolation. This strategy has been implemented locally in various settings and generalized in Egypt. Here, using a mathematical model coupling hospitals and community, we assess the impact of this strategy on overall epidemic dynamics. We find that quarantine hospitals may significantly reduce the number of cumulative cases, as well as the peak incidence, when effective control strategies are in place in the community and symptomatic HCWs comply with self-isolation recommendations. Our results, which are robust to variations in assumed biological characteristics of the virus, suggest that the quarantine hospital strategy could be considered in future pandemic contexts to best protect the entire population.

Using data from gene combination double knockout (CDKO) experiments, top ranked synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs were highly inconsistent among different SL scores. This leads to a significant concern that SL prediction models highly depend on SL scores. In this paper, we introduce a new gene combination effect (GCE) measurement, log-fold change of dual-gRNA expression before and after CRISPR-cas9 lentivirus transfection. We show it is a direct and highly consistent measurement of GCE in all CDKO experiments. We therefore develop a multi-layer encoder model for individual sample specific GCE prediction, MLEC-iGeneCombo. Under a deep learning framework, MLEC-iGeneCombo is a systems biology model that contains sample specific multi-omics encoder, network encoder and cell-line encoder. For the first time, MLEC-iGeneCombo predicts GCE for a new cell. Using data from 18 CDKO experiments, MLEC-iGeneCombo achieves an average GCE prediction performance, 71.9%. All three encoders significantly improve the model’s prediction performance (p≤0.01), and their combined use yields the best GCE prediction performance. Our source code is available at https://github.com/karenyun/MLEC-iGeneCombo.

                <p>by Guillermo Martín-Sánchez, Christian K. Machens, William F. Podlaski</p>

Hippocampal remapping, in which place cells form distinct activity maps across different environments, is a well-established phenomenon with a range of theoretical interpretations. Some theories propose that remapping helps to minimize interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others link it to shifts in an underlying latent state representation. However, how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with, remains unclear. To unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping, we here adopt a neural coding and population geometry perspective. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce remapping: (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability in the null space of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature. Overall, our work serves as a unifying framework with which to visualize, understand, and compare the wide array of theories and experimental observations about remapping, and may serve as a testbed for understanding neural response variability under various experimental conditions.

                <p>by Sobhan Shukueian Tabrizi, Sina Barazandeh, Helyasadat Hashemi Aghdam, A. Ercument Cicek</p>

Protein-RNA interactions are essential in gene regulation, splicing, RNA stability, and translation, making RNA a promising therapeutic agent for targeting proteins, including those considered undruggable. However, designing RNA sequences that selectively bind to proteins remains a significant challenge due to the vast sequence space and limitations of current experimental and computational methods. Traditional approaches rely on in vitro selection techniques or computational models that require post-generation optimization, restricting their applicability to well-characterized proteins.
We introduce RNAtranslator, a generative language model that formulates protein-conditional RNA design as a sequence-to-sequence natural language translation problem for the first time. By learning a joint representation of RNA and protein interactions from large-scale datasets, RNAtranslator directly generates binding RNA sequences for any given protein target without the need for additional optimization. Our results demonstrate that RNAtranslator produces RNA sequences with natural-like properties, high novelty, and enhanced binding affinity compared to existing methods. This approach enables efficient RNA design for a wide range of proteins and even proteins with no RNA-interaction data available, paving the way for new RNA-based therapeutics and synthetic biology applications

                <p>by Daniel Chapman, Flavia Occhibove, James M. Bullock, Pieter S. A. Beck, Juan A. Navas-Cortes, Steven M. White</p>

Mathematical and computational models play a crucial role in understanding the epidemiology of economically important plant disease outbreaks, and in evaluating the effectiveness of surveillance and disease management measures. A case in point is <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, one of the world’s most deadly plant pathogens. Since its European discovery in olives in Puglia, Italy in 2013, there remain key knowledge gaps that undermine landscape-scale containment efforts of the outbreak, most notably concerning the year of introduction, the rate of spread, dispersal mechanisms and control efficacy. To address this, we developed a spatially explicit simulation model for the outbreak spreading among olive groves coupled to a simulation of the real surveillance and containment measures. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit the model to surveillance and remote-sensing infection data, comparing the fits for three alternative dispersal mechanisms (isotropic, wind and road). The model accurately explained the rate and spatiotemporal pattern of the outbreak and found weak support for the wind dispersal model over the isotropic model. It suggests that the bacterium may have been introduced as early as 2003 (95% CI [2000, 2009]), earlier than previous estimates and congruent with anecdotal evidence. The isotropic model estimates the pathogen is spreading at 5.7 km y<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI [5.4-5.9]) under containment measures, down from 7.2 km y<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI [6.9-7.5]) without containment measures. Our estimate of an approximately 10-year lag between introduction and detection highlights the need for stronger biosecurity and surveillance for earlier detection of emerging plant pathogens. The outputs from simulations without any disease management also suggest that while containment measures have caused some slowing of <i>X. fastidiosa</i> spread, stronger measures will be required to contain the outbreak fully.

Epidemic prevalence surveys monitor the spread of an infectious disease by regularly testing representative samples of a population for infection. State-of-the-art Bayesian approaches for analysing epidemic survey data were constructed independently and under pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we compare two existing approaches (one leveraging Bayesian P-splines and the other approximate Gaussian processes) with a novel approach (leveraging a random walk and fit using sequential Monte Carlo) for smoothing and performing inference on epidemic survey data. We use our simpler approach to investigate the impact of survey design and underlying epidemic dynamics on the quality of estimates. We then incorporate these considerations into the existing approaches and compare all three on simulated data and on real-world data from the SARS-CoV-2 REACT-1 prevalence study in England. All three approaches, once appropriate considerations are made, produce similar estimates of infection prevalence; however, estimates of the growth rate and instantaneous reproduction number are more sensitive to underlying assumptions. Interactive notebooks applying all three approaches are also provided alongside recommendations on hyperparameter selection and other practical guidance, with some cases resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster runtime.

                <p>by Peter Scarfe, Paul B. Hibbard</p>

Ocular convergence is one of the critical cues from which to estimate the absolute distance to objects in the world, because unlike most other distance cues a one-to-one mapping exists between absolute distance and ocular convergence. However, even when accurately converging their eyes on an object, humans tend to underestimate its distance, particularly for more distant objects. This systematic bias in distance perception has yet to be explained and questions the utility of vergence as an absolute distance cue. Here we present a probabilistic geometric model that shows how distance underestimation can be explained by the visual system estimating the most likely distance in the world to have caused an accurate, but noisy, ocular convergence signal. Furthermore, we find that the noise in the vergence signal needed to account for human distance underestimation is comparable to that experimentally measured. Critically, our results depend on the formulation of a likelihood function that takes account of the generative function relating distance to ocular convergence.

                <p>by Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Emma Lejeune</p>

In cardiac cells, structural organization is an important indicator of cell maturity and healthy function. Healthy and mature cardiomyocytes exhibit a highly organized structure, characterized by well-aligned almost crystalline morphology with densely packed and organized sarcomeres. Immature and/or diseased cardiomyocytes typically lack this highly organized structure. Critically, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer a valuable model for studying human cardiac cells in a controlled, patient-specific, and minimally invasive manner. However, these cells often exhibit a disorganized and difficult to quantify structure both in their immature form and as disease models. In this work, we extend the SarcGraph computational framework—designed specifically to assess the structural and functional behavior of hiPSC-CMs—to better accommodate the structural features of immature cells. There are two key enhancements: (1) incorporating a deep learning-based z-disc classifier, and (2) introducing a novel ensemble graph-scoring approach. These modification significantly reduced false positive sarcomere detections, particularly in immature cells, and improved the detection of longer myofibrils in mature samples. With this enhanced framework, we analyze an open-source dataset published by the Allen Institute for Cell Science, where, for the first time, we are able to extract key structural features from these data using information from each individually detected sarcomere. Not only are we able to use these structural features to predict expert scores, but we are also able to use these structural features to identify bias in expert scoring and offer an alternative unsupervised learning approach based on explainable clustering. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our modified SarcGraph algorithm in extracting biologically meaningful structural features, enabling a deeper understanding of hiPSC-CM structural integrity. By making our code and tools open-source, we aim to empower the broader cardiac research community and foster further development of computational tools for cardiac tissue analysis.

                <p>by Yuting Liu, Leiru Huang, Ruipeng Wang, Fukang Qi, Yiwen Liu, Qingyuan Chen, Morgane Mialon, Lili Chen, Berangere Pinan-Lucarre, Shangbang Gao</p>

Nicotine exposure elicits diverse behavioral changes, yet the underlying neural pathways and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that chronic nicotine exposure markedly increases both the initiation and duration of reversals in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Strikingly, these reversals were tightly coupled with the rhythmic body contractions of the defecation motor program (DMP). Through pharmacological, genetic, in situ electrophysiological, and calcium imaging analyses, we show that nicotine enhances the activity of the AVA interneuron via selective upregulation of ACR-16, a nicotinic ACh receptor critical for nicotine-induced motor coupling. Ablation of touch receptor neurons (TRNs) or inhibition of TRNs-mediated mechanosensation completely abolished this coupling. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of TRNs in nicotine-treated animals evoked stronger AVA depolarization, and nicotine amplified gentle touch-evoked reversals. Together, these findings reveal a potential interoceptive effect of nicotine mediated by sensitization of the TRNs-AVA mechanosensory pathway, providing new insight into the neural and molecular basis of nicotine’s modulation of sensory-motor coupling.

Sexual reproduction in basidiomycete fungi is governed by <i>MAT</i> loci (<i>P/R</i> and <i>HD</i>), which exhibit remarkable evolutionary plasticity, characterized by expansions, rearrangements, and gene losses often associated with mating system transitions. The sister genera <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Kwoniella</i> provide a powerful framework for studying <i>MAT</i> loci evolution owing to their diverse reproductive strategies and distinct architectures, spanning bipolar and tetrapolar systems with either linked or unlinked <i>MAT</i> loci. Building on recent comparative genomic analyses, we generated additional chromosome-level assemblies, uncovering distinct trajectories shaping <i>MAT</i> loci organization. Contrasting with the small-scale expansions and gene acquisitions observed in <i>Kwoniella</i>, our analyses revealed independent expansions of the <i>P/R</i> locus in tetrapolar <i>Cryptococcus</i>, possibly driven by pheromone gene duplications. Notably, these expansions coincided with a pronounced GC-content reduction best explained by reduced GC-biased gene conversion following recombination suppression, rather than relaxed codon usage selection. Diverse modes of <i>MAT</i> locus linkage were also identified, including three previously unrecognized transitions: one resulting in a pseudobipolar arrangement and two leading to bipolarity. All three transitions involved translocations. In the pseudobipolar configuration, the <i>P/R</i> and <i>HD</i> loci remained on the same chromosome but genetically unlinked, whereas the bipolar transitions additionally featured rearrangements that fused the two loci into a nonrecombining region. Mating assays confirmed a sexual cycle in <i>Cryptococcus decagattii</i>, demonstrating its ability to undergo mating and sporulation. Progeny analysis in <i>Kwoniella mangrovensis</i> revealed substantial ploidy variation and aneuploidy, likely stemming from haploid–diploid mating, yet evidence of recombination and loss of heterozygosity indicates that meiotic exchange occurs despite irregular chromosome segregation. Our findings underscore the importance of continued diversity sampling and provide further evidence for convergent evolution of fused <i>MAT</i> loci in basidiomycetes, offering new insights into the genetic and chromosomal changes driving reproductive transitions.

                <p>by Ashley M. Ingiosi</p>

Astrocytes help control sleep and arousal. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that a wake-promoting signal called histamine affects how astrocytes respond to and modulate other brain signals and reduces time spent awake through astroglial histamine-1-receptors.

Astrocytes are increasingly understood to modulate sleep and arousal. This Primer highlights a recent PLOS Biology study elucidating the mechanisms of this regulation, revealing that histamine-1-receptor signaling in astrocytes modulates intracellular calcium and extracellular adenosine dynamics to regulate arousal.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The growing demand for personalized treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS) highlights the need for more precise biomarkers that can outperform magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessment in patient stratification. Advances in multiplex proteomic technologies suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis at MS onset may not only improve diagnostic accuracy, but also offer prognostic and staging information, as well as insight into molecular therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study retrospectively analyzed cryopreserved CSF samples from 160 individuals undergoing diagnostic evaluation for possible neuroimmunological disorder, and among these, followed a cohort of 96 people with confirmed MS for at least 3 years. The goal was to externally validate previously published CSF-based diagnostic and prognostic classifiers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Upon unblinding, the CSF-based molecular diagnostic test distinguished 96 people with confirmed MS from 30 individuals with other inflammatory neurological diseases, and 34 individuals with non-inflammatory neurological diseases, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 (<i>p</i> = 4.7 × 10<sup>−21</sup>). The test also differentiated 65 individuals with relapsing–remitting MS from 31 individuals with progressive MS, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (<i>p</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The prognostic classifier predicted prospectively measured Expanded Disability Status Scale scores at follow up (rho = 0.43, <i>p</i> = 2.54 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This multicenter external validation study demonstrates that CSF-based molecular tests can robustly distinguish MS from other neurological conditions, stratify MS subtypes, and predict future disability progression in real-world settings. These results lay the groundwork for development of next-generation molecular tools to personalize care in MS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Aviation English, a specialised language field for areas like aircraft maintenance, involves more complex pedagogy than general English, as it addresses specific learner needs within an aviation context. Teachers in this field must understand aviation-specific content and students’ linguistic needs to design courses that meet professional communication demands while adhering to legal and safety standards emphasizing clarity. Methods This study examined Malaysian aviation English teachers’ experiences in developing tailored courses. Using semi-structured interviews with three teachers from aviation schools accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), data were transcribed and analysed in ATLAS.ti, with rigor ensured through member checking, prolonged engagement, and external audits. Results Findings revealed three key themes: teachers’ understanding of aviation English, integration of aviation content, and instructional challenges. Participants described an extensive learning process in acquiring aviation knowledge and creatively integrating it into lessons through relevant activities and real-life applications. Challenges included varied student abilities, limited resources, and inadequate institutional support. Conclusions The study explored how English teachers acquire and apply aviation knowledge and teaching skills, highlighting areas that could benefit from improved training and credentialing. Limitations include a small sample size and brief data collection period (March to August 2024), restricting generalisability, while the thematic analysis method may limit deeper exploration of nuanced experiences. Nonetheless, the study offers insights to enhance aviation English instruction for aviation students’ linguistic and professional needs.

                Background and Objectives Controlling blood pressure is a central objective in the management of hypertension. However, it is often inadequate due to environmental and/or patient-related factors. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure and to identify the associated risk factors in hypertensive patients followed up in health centers in Settat city. Materials and Methods A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2023 to February 2024 in 21 primary care facilities (12 urban and 9 rural) in Settat, including 1004 hypertensive patients. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire covering medical, therapeutic and knowledge aspects of hypertension. Compliance medication was assessed by the Girerd test, and physical activity by the Global Physical Activity questionnaire recommended by the World Health Organization. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were taken in accordance with international standards. Results Uncontrolled blood pressure affected 57.9% (n=581) of patients. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant association with rural environment (OR = 3.13; 95% CI [2.06-4.74]), advanced age (OR = 1.39; CI95% [1.09-1.63]), low monthly income (OR = 1.37; CI95% [1.21-1.56]), high-salt diet (OR = 1.39; CI95% [1.15-1.69]) and poor compliance with medication (OR = 7.24; CI95% [5.09-10.31]). Conclusion Unsatisfactory blood pressure control in Moroccan hypertensive patients has highlighted the need to take into account the sociodemographic dimension in the management of hypertension, and the role of health centers in supplying patients with antihypertensive drugs and therapeutic and behavioral education to optimize blood pressure control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1034/v1?src=rss">Correspondence: Addressing Systemic Barriers for Global Majority Nurses in UK Research Capability Development – A Call for Intersectional Solutions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background While systematic barriers preventing nurses from advancing into research capability and leadership positions have been well-documented, the compounded challenges faced by Global Majority nurses remain underexplored. Purpose This commentary expands upon Vamadevan et al.’s (2025) systematic narrative review to examine intersectional barriers preventing Global Majority nurses from developing research capability and achieving leadership positions within UK healthcare systems. Methods Drawing on recent empirical evidence and workforce statistics, this analysis examines how structural discrimination, cultural isolation, and systemic inequities create additional barriers for Global Majority nurses beyond those identified in existing nursing career development research. Key Arguments Global Majority nurses face intersecting challenges that compound existing structural barriers to research capability development, including systematic discrimination in recruitment and career progression, cultural isolation due to lack of diverse representation in leadership positions, and exclusion from informal networks facilitating professional advancement. Current diversity initiatives operate within systems maintaining structural barriers and adopt deficit models placing change burden on individuals rather than addressing institutional practices. Implications Comprehensive systemic reforms are required including transparent recruitment and promotion processes, targeted mentorship programmes addressing cultural and professional challenges, organisational culture change initiatives addressing systemic racism, and equitable research funding access. Conclusion Excluding Global Majority perspectives from research capability development represents both moral imperative and practical necessity for UK healthcare systems. Transformative action is essential to create inclusive and equitable pathways for all nursing professionals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1033/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty Following Repeated Botulinum Toxin Injections: A Case Report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatochalasis of the upper eyelids is a frequent age-related condition that may impair vision and pose a major aesthetic concern. Although both surgical and nonsurgical treatments are available, improper or repeated administration of nonsurgical approaches, such as botulinum toxin (BT) injections, can lead to functional issues, including eyelid heaviness, ocular fatigue, and patient dissatisfaction. We report the case of a 45-year-old Syrian man with bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis who had received multiple periocular BT injections over two years. Despite initial improvement, he developed recurrent skin redundancy, ocular heaviness, fatigue, headaches, and aesthetic dissatisfaction. Clinical examination revealed bilateral eyelid skin redundancy and superior visual field restriction with preserved levator function. Bilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty was performed, involving careful excision of redundant skin, removal of excessive preaponeurotic fat likely accentuated by prior BT treatment and partial excision of the orbicularis oculi muscle, while preserving the levator apparatus and orbital septum integrity. The procedure was completed without complications. Postoperatively, the patient experienced complete resolution of eyelid heaviness and subjective improvement in the visual field, as well as a more defined eyelid contour and improved symmetry. Patient satisfaction, measured using the Blepharoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (BOE) questionnaire, increased from 25% preoperatively to 96.8% at three and six months postoperatively. This case demonstrates that upper eyelid blepharoplasty remains the gold standard for managing dermatochalasis, particularly when nonsurgical interventions have failed or produced functional complications. The procedure can successfully restore eyelid function, improve visual performance, and achieve high aesthetic satisfaction, highlighting the importance of proper patient selection and timely surgical intervention in the management of upper eyelid aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1032/v1?src=rss">Between Protection and Destruction: The Legal Tension Between Military Necessity and Cultural Heritage Protection in International Humanitarian Law [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The relationship between military necessity and the protection of cultural heritage under international humanitarian law has been and continues to be governed by a constant tension that has shaped both doctrine and practice. While the principle of military necessity, rooted in and derived from the 1863 Lieber Code and codified in later instruments such as the 1907 Hague Conventions, remains one of the most fundamental principles permitting the adoption of measures necessary to achieve legitimate military objectives, it has also been used to justify the destruction of cultural property. Conversely, cultural heritage, deserving special protection under instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention and its Protocols, represents the collective memory and identity of societies. Methods To evaluate the role of military necessity in the prosecution of crimes against cultural heritage, this paper uses a critical doctrinal and analytical approach, looking at both treaty law and international jurisprudence. It asks whether military necessity is a valid practical safeguard or a legal pretext for destruction. Results The paper contends that the incorporation of “imperative military necessity” has engendered critical legal loopholes resulting from warring parties’ exploitation of the prioritization of military interests over the preservation of cultural heritage, rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflicts. International tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have endeavoured to restrict these justifications by criminalizing deliberate attacks and applying standards of necessity and proportionality. Conclusions The paper concludes that, despite treaties and jurisprudence limiting the scope of military necessity, the ongoing recognition of the necessity exception reveals structural weaknesses in international humanitarian law, thereby rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflict. Accordingly, it advocates for the strict limitation of the ‘imperative military necessity’ exception to provide better protection for cultural heritage during armed conflict.

                Guo et al. identify the peptide Vulnusin as an acute wound signal that activates C4da nociceptors through the PPK1/PPK26 ion channel in Drosophila larvae. Vulnusin localizes in the extracellular space apical to the epidermis when uninjured but reaches the C4da nociceptor upon damage to trigger the nociceptive rolling behavior.

                Luo et al. identify distinct supramammillary-dentate gyrus subcircuits that differentially regulate memory and emotion. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models, these pathways show aberrant activity, but targeted optogenetic activation selectively restores cognitive or affective functions, revealing circuit-level mechanisms underlying diverse AD symptoms and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01159-3?rss=yes">Constrained hypermutation and absence of TERT promoter mutations in Lynch syndrome-associated urothelial cancer</a></h4>

              
                Nikkola et al. demonstrate that Lynch syndrome-associated urothelial cancers are mismatch-repair deficient and evolve through a mutagenic process dominated by 5-methylcytosine deamination and microsatellite instability. This results in a distinct mutational landscape marked by the absence of TERT promoter mutations and near-universal mutation of ARID1A, FGFR3, and KMT2D.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01111-8?rss=yes">Emerging trends in the disassembly of stress granules and P-bodies</a></h4>

              
                Stress granules (SGs) and P-bodies (PBs) are dynamic RNA-protein condensates regulating mRNA fate. While assembly mechanisms are well studied, emerging insights into their dissolution are now coming to light. Here, Garg et al. highlight the current understanding of disassembly mechanisms and their implications in neurodegeneration and cancer.
