              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18278">Heterogeneous populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons: on the generality of Lorentzian distributions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, next-generation neural mass models have become increasingly prominent in mathematical neuroscience. These models link microscopic dynamics with low-dimensional systems of so-called firing rate equations that exactly capture the collective dynamics of large populations of heterogeneous quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons. A particularly tractable type of heterogeneity is the distribution of the QIF neurons' excitability parameters, or inputs, according to a Lorentzian. While other distributions -- such as those approximating Gaussian or uniform distributions -- admit to exact mean-field reductions, they result in more complex firing rate equations that are challenging to analyze, and it remains unclear whether they produce comparable collective dynamics. Here, we first demonstrate why Lorentzian heterogeneity is analytically favorable and, second, identify when it leads to qualitatively different collective dynamics compared to other types of heterogeneity. A stationary mean-field approach enables us to derive explicit expressions for the distributions of the neurons' firing rates and voltages in macroscopic stationary states with arbitrary heterogeneities. We also explicate the exclusive relationship between Lorentzian distributed inputs and Lorentzian distributed voltages, whose width happens to coincide with the population firing rate. A dynamic mean-field approach for unimodal heterogeneities further allows us to comprehensively analyze and compare collective dynamics. We find that different types of heterogeneity typically yield qualitatively similar dynamics. However, when gap junction coupling is present, Lorentzian heterogeneity induces nonuniversal behavior, obscuring a diversity-induced transition to synchrony.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18333">A Framework for Standardizing Similarity Measures in a Rapidly Evolving Field</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarity measures are fundamental tools for quantifying the alignment between artificial and biological systems. However, the diversity of similarity measures and their varied naming and implementation conventions makes it challenging to compare across studies. To facilitate comparisons and make explicit the implementation choices underlying a given code package, we have created and are continuing to develop a Python repository that benchmarks and standardizes similarity measures. The goal of creating a consistent naming convention that uniquely and efficiently specifies a similarity measure is not trivial as, for example, even commonly used methods like Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) have at least 12 different variations, and this number will likely continue to grow as the field evolves. For this reason, we do not advocate for a fixed, definitive naming convention. The landscape of similarity measures and best practices will continue to change and so we see our current repository, which incorporates approximately 100 different similarity measures from 14 packages, as providing a useful tool at this snapshot in time. To accommodate the evolution of the field we present a framework for developing, validating, and refining naming conventions with the goal of uniquely and efficiently specifying similarity measures, ultimately making it easier for the community to make comparisons across studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946">Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18462">Latent Representation Learning for Multimodal Brain Activity Translation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience employs diverse neuroimaging techniques, each offering distinct insights into brain activity, from electrophysiological recordings such as EEG, which have high temporal resolution, to hemodynamic modalities such as fMRI, which have increased spatial precision. However, integrating these heterogeneous data sources remains a challenge, which limits a comprehensive understanding of brain function. We present the Spatiotemporal Alignment of Multimodal Brain Activity (SAMBA) framework, which bridges the spatial and temporal resolution gaps across modalities by learning a unified latent space free of modality-specific biases. SAMBA introduces a novel attention-based wavelet decomposition for spectral filtering of electrophysiological recordings, graph attention networks to model functional connectivity between functional brain units, and recurrent layers to capture temporal autocorrelations in brain signal. We show that the training of SAMBA, aside from achieving translation, also learns a rich representation of brain information processing. We showcase this classify external stimuli driving brain activity from the representation learned in hidden layers of SAMBA, paving the way for broad downstream applications in neuroscience research and clinical contexts.

Abstract: We introduce a generic, compositional and interpretable class of generative world models that supports open-ended learning agents. This is a sparse class of Bayesian networks capable of approximating a broad range of stochastic processes, which provide agents with the ability to learn world models in a manner that may be both interpretable and computationally scalable. This approach integrating Bayesian structure learning and intrinsically motivated (model-based) planning enables agents to actively develop and refine their world models, which may lead to open-ended learning and more robust, adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00148">Mapping effective connectivity by virtually perturbing a surrogate brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2301.00148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective connectivity (EC), indicative of the causal interactions between brain regions, is fundamental to understanding information processing in the brain. Traditional approaches, which infer EC from neural responses to stimulations, are not suited for mapping whole-brain EC in humans due to being invasive and having limited spatial coverage of stimulations. To address this gap, we present Neural Perturbational Inference (NPI), a data-driven framework designed to map EC across the entire brain. NPI employs an artificial neural network trained to learn large-scale neural dynamics as a computational surrogate of the brain. NPI maps EC by perturbing each region of the surrogate brain and observing the resulting responses in all other regions. NPI captures the directionality, strength, and excitatory/inhibitory properties of brain-wide EC. Our validation of NPI, using models having ground-truth EC, shows its superiority over Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling. Applying NPI to resting-state fMRI data from diverse datasets reveals consistent and structurally supported EC. Further validation using a cortico-cortical evoked potentials dataset reveals a significant correlation between NPI-inferred EC and real stimulation propagation pathways. By transitioning from correlational to causal understandings of brain functionality, NPI marks a stride in decoding the brain's functional architecture and facilitating both neuroscience research and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07106">Molecular Quantum (MolQ) Communication Channel in the Gut-Brain Axis Synapse</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.07106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gut-brain axis is the communication link between the gut and the brain. Although it is known that the gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in homeostasis, its overall mechanism is still not known. However, for neural synapses, classical molecular communication is described by the formation of ligand-receptor complexes, which leads to the opening of ion channels. Moreover, there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled before the opening of the ion channel. In this study, we consider the gut-brain axis, where neurotransmitters diffuse through the synaptic cleft, considering molecular communication. On the vagus nerve (VN) membrane, i.e., the post-synaptic membrane of the synapse, it undergoes a quantum communication (QC), which initiates the opening of the ion channel, thus initiating the communication signal from the gut to the brain. It evolves a new paradigm of communication approach, Molecular Quantum (MolQ) communication. Based on the QC model, we theoretically analyze the output states, and QC is simulated considering the incoming neurotransmitter's concentration and validated by analyzing the entropy and the mutual information of the input, i.e., neurotransmitter's concentration, and output, i.e., ion channel opening.

                arXiv:2409.04928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately memorise transition mappings of multiple external Turing machines to form a universal machine. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.

Abstract: Chaos is generic in strongly-coupled recurrent networks of model neurons, and thought to be an easily accessible dynamical regime in the brain. While neural chaos is typically seen as an impediment to robust computation, we show how such chaos might play a functional role in allowing the brain to learn and sample from generative models. We construct architectures that combine a classic model of neural chaos either with a canonical generative modeling architecture or with energy-based models of neural memory. We show that these architectures have appealing properties for sampling, including easy biologically-plausible control of sampling rates via overall gain modulation.

Brains are adept at learning stable representations given small samples of noisy observations; across sensory modalities, this capacity is aided by a cascade of signal conditioning steps informed by domain knowledge. The olfactory system, in particular, solves a source separation and denoising problem compounded by concentration variability, environmental interference, and unpredictably correlated sensor affinities. To function optimally, its plastic network requires statistically well-behaved input. We present a data-blind neuromorphic signal conditioning strategy whereby analog data are normalized and quantized into spike phase representations. Input is delivered to a column of duplicated spiking principal neurons via heterogeneous synaptic weights; this regularizes layer utilization, yoking total activity to the network's operating range and rendering internal representations robust to uncontrolled open-set stimulus variance. We extend this mechanism by adding a data-aware calibration step whereby the range and density of the quantization weights adapt to accumulated input statistics, optimizing resource utilization by balancing activity regularization and information retention.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has potential applications in various fields, but their development is hindered by limited data and significant cross-individual variability. Inspired by the principles of learning and memory in the human hippocampus, we propose a multi-task (MT) classification model, called AM-MTEEG, which combines learning-based impulsive neural representations with bidirectional associative memory (AM) for cross-individual BCI classification tasks. The model treats the EEG classification of each individual as an independent task and facilitates feature sharing across individuals. Our model consists of an impulsive neural population coupled with a convolutional encoder-decoder to extract shared features and a bidirectional associative memory matrix to map features to class. Experimental results in two BCI competition datasets show that our model improves average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and reduces performance variance across individuals, and the waveforms reconstructed by the bidirectional associative memory provide interpretability for the model's classification results. The neuronal firing patterns in our model are highly coordinated, similarly to the neural coding of hippocampal neurons, indicating that our model has biological similarities.

                arXiv:2402.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior can be described as a temporal sequence of actions driven by neural activity. To learn complex sequential patterns in neural networks, memories of past activities need to persist on significantly longer timescales than the relaxation times of single-neuron activity. While recurrent networks can produce such long transients, training these networks is a challenge. Learning via error propagation confers models such as FORCE, RTRL or BPTT a significant functional advantage, but at the expense of biological plausibility. While reservoir computing circumvents this issue by learning only the readout weights, it does not scale well with problem complexity. We propose that two prominent structural features of cortical networks can alleviate these issues: the presence of a certain network scaffold at the onset of learning and the existence of dendritic compartments for enhancing neuronal information storage and computation. Our resulting model for Efficient Learning of Sequences (ELiSe) builds on these features to acquire and replay complex non-Markovian spatio-temporal patterns using only local, always-on and phase-free synaptic plasticity. We showcase the capabilities of ELiSe in a mock-up of birdsong learning, and demonstrate its flexibility with respect to parametrization, as well as its robustness to external disturbances.

Abstract: Novel imaging and neurostimulation techniques open doors for advancements in closed-loop control of activity in biological neural networks. This would allow for applications in the investigation of activity propagation, and for diagnosis and treatment of pathological behaviour. Due to the partially observable characteristics of activity propagation, through networks in which edges can not be observed, and the dynamic nature of neuronal systems, there is a need for adaptive, generalisable control. In this paper, we introduce an environment that procedurally generates neuronal networks with different topologies to investigate this generalisation problem. Additionally, an existing transformer-based architecture is adjusted to evaluate the generalisation performance of a deep RL agent in the presented partially observable environment. The agent demonstrates the capability to generalise control from a limited number of training networks to unseen test networks.

                arXiv:2409.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum clique problem (MCP) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and in computational complexity. Given a graph G, the problem is that of finding the largest clique (complete subgraph) in G. The MCP has many important applications in different domains and has been much studied. The problem has been shown to be NP-Hard and the corresponding decision problem to be NP-Complete. All exact (optimal) algorithms discovered so far run in exponential time. Various meta-heuristics have been used to approximate the MCP. These include genetic and memetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, greedy algorithms, Tabu algorithms, and simulated annealing. This study presents a critical examination of the effectiveness of applying genetic algorithms (GAs) to the MCP compared to a purely stochastic approach. Our results indicate that Monte Carlo algorithms, which employ random searches to generate and then refine sub-graphs into cliques, often surpass genetic algorithms in both speed and capability, particularly in less dense graphs. This observation challenges the conventional reliance on genetic algorithms, suggesting a reevaluation of the roles of the crossover and mutation operators in exploring the solution space. We observe that, in some of the denser graphs, the recombination strategy of genetic algorithms shows unexpected efficacy, hinting at the untapped potential of genetic methods under specific conditions. This work not only questions established paradigms but also opens avenues for exploring algorithmic efficiency in solving the MCP and other NP-Hard problems, inviting further research into the conditions that favor purely stochastic methods over genetic recombination and vice versa.

                arXiv:2409.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel batch processing machines have extensive applications in the semiconductor manufacturing process. However, the problem models in previous studies regard parallel batch processing as a fixed processing stage in the machining process. This study generalizes the problem model, in which users can arbitrarily set certain stages as parallel batch processing stages according to their needs. A Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Parallel Batch Processing Machines (PBHFSP) is solved in this paper. Furthermore, an Adaptive Knowledge-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (AMOEA/D) is designed to simultaneously optimize both makespan and Total Energy Consumption (TEC). Firstly, a hybrid initialization strategy with heuristic rules based on knowledge of PBHFSP is proposed to generate promising solutions. Secondly, the disjunctive graph model has been established based on the knowledge to find the critical-path of PBHFS. Then, a critical-path based neighborhood search is proposed to enhance the exploitation ability of AMOEA/D. Moreover, the search time is adaptively adjusted based on learning experience from Q-learning and Decay Law. Afterward, to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm, AMOEA/D designs an improved population updating strategy with a weight vector updating strategy. These strategies rematch individuals with weight vectors, thereby maintaining the diversity of the population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the AMOEA/D is superior to the comparison algorithms in solving the PBHFSP.

                arXiv:2409.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing-in-memory (CIM) is an emerging computing paradigm, offering noteworthy potential for accelerating neural networks with high parallelism, low latency, and energy efficiency compared to conventional von Neumann architectures. However, existing research has primarily focused on hardware architecture and network co-design for large-scale neural networks, without considering resource constraints. In this study, we aim to develop edge-friendly deep neural networks (DNNs) for accelerators based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM). To achieve this, we propose an edge compilation and resource-constrained RRAM-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework to search for optimized neural networks meeting specific hardware constraints. Our compilation approach integrates layer partitioning, duplication, and network packing to maximize the utilization of computation units. The resulting network architecture can be optimized for either high accuracy or low latency using a one-shot neural network approach with Pareto optimality achieved through the Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The compilation of mobile-friendly networks, like Squeezenet and MobilenetV3 small can achieve over 80% of utilization and over 6x speedup compared to ISAAC-like framework with different crossbar resources. The resulting model from NAS optimized for speed achieved 5x-30x speedup. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/ArChiiii/rram_nas_comp_pack.

                arXiv:2409.18568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating machine learning (ML) into customer service chatbots enhances their ability to understand and respond to user queries, ultimately improving service performance. However, they may appear artificial to some users and affecting customer experience. Hence, meticulous evaluation of ML models for each pipeline component is crucial for optimizing performance, though differences in functionalities can lead to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we present a tailored experimental evaluation approach for goal-oriented customer service chatbots with pipeline architecture, focusing on three key components: Natural Language Understanding (NLU), dialogue management (DM), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Our methodology emphasizes individual assessment to determine optimal ML models. Specifically, we focus on optimizing hyperparameters and evaluating candidate models for NLU (utilizing BERT and LSTM), DM (employing DQN and DDQN), and NLG (leveraging GPT-2 and DialoGPT). The results show that for the NLU component, BERT excelled in intent detection whereas LSTM was superior for slot filling. For the DM component, the DDQN model outperformed DQN by achieving fewer turns, higher rewards, as well as greater success rates. For NLG, the large language model GPT-2 surpassed DialoGPT in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE metrics. These findings aim to provide a benchmark for future research in developing and optimizing customer service chatbots, offering valuable insights into model performance and optimal hyperparameters.

                arXiv:2409.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain dependence and annotation subjectivity pose challenges for supervised keyword extraction. Based on the premises that second-order keyness patterns are existent at the community level and learnable from annotated keyword extraction datasets, this paper proposes a supervised ranking approach to keyword extraction that ranks keywords with keyness patterns consisting of independent features (such as sublanguage domain and term length) and three categories of dependent features -- heuristic features, specificity features, and representavity features. The approach uses two convolutional-neural-network based models to learn keyness patterns from keyword datasets and overcomes annotation subjectivity by training the two models with bootstrap sampling strategy. Experiments demonstrate that the approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten keyword datasets in general supervised keyword extraction with an average top-10-F-measure of 0.316 , but also robust cross-domain performance with an average top-10-F-measure of 0.346 on four datasets that are excluded in the training process. Such cross-domain robustness is attributed to the fact that community-level keyness patterns are limited in number and temperately independent of language domains, the distinction between independent features and dependent features, and the sampling training strategy that balances excess risk and lack of negative training data.

Abstract: In a flexible job shop environment, using Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to transport jobs and process materials is an important way to promote the intelligence of the workshop. Compared with single-load AGVs, multi-load AGVs can improve AGV utilization, reduce path conflicts, etc. Therefore, this study proposes a history-guided regional partitioning algorithm (HRPEO) for the flexible job shop scheduling problem with limited multi-load AGVs (FJSPMA). First, the encoding and decoding rules are designed according to the characteristics of multi-load AGVs, and then the initialization rule based on the branch and bound method is used to generate the initial population. Second, to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum, the algorithm adopts a regional partitioning strategy. This strategy divides the solution space into multiple regions and measures the potential of the regions. After that, cluster the regions into multiple clusters in each iteration, and selects individuals for evolutionary search based on the set of clusters. Third, a local search strategy is designed to improve the exploitation ability of the algorithm, which uses a greedy approach to optimize machines selection and transportation sequence according to the characteristics of FJSPMA. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out on the benchmarks to test the performance of the algorithm. Compared with multiple advanced algorithms, the results show that the HRPEO has a better advantage in solving FJSPMA.

                arXiv:2401.15876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most successful methods for solving continuous black-box optimization problems. A practically useful aspect of the CMA-ES is that it can be used without hyperparameter tuning. However, the hyperparameter settings still have a considerable impact on performance, especially for difficult tasks, such as solving multimodal or noisy problems. This study comprehensively explores the impact of learning rate on the CMA-ES performance and demonstrates the necessity of a small learning rate by considering ordinary differential equations. Thereafter, it discusses the setting of an ideal learning rate. Based on these discussions, we develop a novel learning rate adaptation mechanism for the CMA-ES that maintains a constant signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, we investigate the behavior of the CMA-ES with the proposed learning rate adaptation mechanism through numerical experiments, and compare the results with those obtained for the CMA-ES with a fixed learning rate and with population size adaptation. The results show that the CMA-ES with the proposed learning rate adaptation works well for multimodal and/or noisy problems without extremely expensive learning rate tuning.

Abstract: Domain-specific hardware to solve computationally hard optimization problems has generated tremendous excitement. Here, we evaluate probabilistic bit (p-bit) based Ising Machines (IM) on the 3-regular 3-Exclusive OR Satisfiability (3R3X), as a representative hard optimization problem. We first introduce a multiplexed architecture that emulates all-to-all network functionality while maintaining highly parallelized chromatic Gibbs sampling. We implement this architecture in single Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and show that running the adaptive parallel tempering algorithm demonstrates competitive algorithmic and prefactor advantages over alternative IMs by D-Wave, Toshiba, and Fujitsu. We also implement higher-order interactions that lead to better prefactors without changing algorithmic scaling for the XORSAT problem. Even though FPGA implementations of p-bits are still not quite as fast as the best possible greedy algorithms accelerated on Graphics Processing Units (GPU), scaled magnetic versions of p-bit IMs could lead to orders of magnitude improvements over the state of the art for generic optimization.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by a complex interplay of genetic, developmental, and environmental factors that significantly increase the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs). This systematic review synthesizes current research on the developmental predictors of SI in individuals with SZ, aiming to delineate the multifactorial etiology of suicide within this population. Methods: A comprehensive search across Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases identified 23 eligible studies, emphasizing the varied methodological approaches and the global distribution of research efforts. Results: These studies demonstrate a robust association between early life adversities, particularly childhood trauma such as physical neglect, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse, and the increased prevalence of SI and SAs in SZ. This review also highlights the significant genetic factors associated with the development of suicidality in SZ, raising the possibility that polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes and neurodevelopmental abnormalities may influence susceptibility to SI. Notably, family history of psychiatric conditions may exacerbate the risk of SI through both hereditary and environmental mechanisms. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic status and social support, are also implicated, underscoring the role of broader socio-environmental conditions influencing outcomes. Conclusions: This review supports the integration of biopsychosocial models in understanding SI in SZ, advocating for interventions addressing the complex interplay of risk factors and the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate the dynamic interactions between risk factors over time. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for developing targeted preventive strategies and enhancing the clinical management of SZ, aiming to reduce suicidality in this vulnerable population.</p>

">Heterogeneous plasticity of amygdala interneurons in associative learning and extinction</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits undergo experience-dependent plasticity to form long-lasting memories. Plasticity of excitatory projection neurons has been considered to be the primary neuronal substrate for the acquisition and storage of memories. However, a wide range of inhibitory interneurons controls the activity of projection neurons in a spatially and temporally precise manner, yet their contribution to memory acquisition, storage and expression remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a miniature microscope imaging approach to monitor the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction at the single cell level. We find that amygdala interneurons display mixed-selectivity and show complex plastic responses at both the ensemble and single neuron level across the acquisition, expression and extinction of aversive memories. In contrast to bidirectional single cell plasticity across distinct fear states, learning-induced changes at the population level occur transiently during conditioning and do not consolidate across days. Examining molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells are predominantly activated by high fear states. In contrast, somatostatin (SST) interneurons display a preference for safety cues and thereby suppress excitatory neuron responsiveness. However, responses of individual neurons within the SST and VIP populations are non-uniform, indicating the presence of functional subtypes within classical molecularly-defined interneuron populations. Taken together, we identify complex neuronal plasticity within amygdala interneuron ensembles that goes beyond a passive processing function, suggesting a critical role of inhibitory microcircuit elements for memory selectivity and stability.

">The Hurst exponent as a marker of inhibition in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                The maturation of inhibitory neurons is crucial for regulating plasticity in developing brains. Previous work using computational models has suggested that the Hurst exponent, the decay in power over frequency, reflects inhibition, but empirical data supporting this link is sparse. Here, we took a cross-species approach to validating the Hurst exponent of fMRI as a marker of inhibition, then characterized the development of the Hurst exponent in childhood. We found significant spatial correlations between the Hurst exponent and ex vivo parvalbumin mRNA expression in human children and adults, and between the Hurst exponent and parvalbumin-positive cell counts in mice. We identified a plateau in the mRNA expression by late childhood, aligning with the Hurst exponent plateau in both humans and rats. In sum, this work suggests that the Hurst exponent can be used to study the development of inhibition in vivo, and in the future, to understand individual differences in plasticity.

">FASER: A TOOL TO SIMULATE PSF DISTORTIONS IN STEDMICROSCOPY</a></h4>

              
                We introduce Faser, a software package developed in Python as a plugin for the open-source napari platform, designed to simulate the excitation point spread functions (PSFs) of microscopes. Using a full-vectorial computational approach to simulate the electromagnetic fields within the focal region, it makes precise predictions and allows detailed analyses of excitation PSFs. Faser is intended as a pedagogical tool enabling users to explore the impact of various geometrical and optical parameters of practical importance on imaging performance. It supports the modeling of complex beam profiles, including donut and bottle-shaped beams, which are instrumental in advanced microscopy techniques such as Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy. Through specific simulations and accessible illustrations, we showcase Faser's capabilities in replicating the distinctive properties of STED beams, making it a valuable resource for researchers and students in optical microscopy to explore and optimize high-resolution imaging techniques.

">Encoding of movement primitives and body posture through distributed proprioception in walking and climbing insects</a></h4>

              
                Targeted reaching movements and spatial coordination of footfall patterns are prime examples of spatial coordination of limbs in insects. To explain this, both physiological and computational studies have suggested the use of movement primitives or the existence of an internal body representation, much like they are assumed to occur in vertebrates. Since insects lack a dedicated posture-sensing organ or vestibular system, it is hypothesized that they derive high-level postural information from low-level proprioceptive cues, integrated across their limbs. The present study tests the extent to which a multi-layer spiking neural network can extract high-level information about limb movement and whole-body posture from information provided by distributed local proprioceptors. In a preceding part of the study, we introduced the phasic-tonic encoding of joint angles by strictly local proprioceptive hair field afferents, as well as high-accuracy encoding of joint angles and angular velocities in first-order interneurons. Here, we extend this model by second-order interneurons that use coincidence detection from two or three leg-local inputs to encode movement primitives of a single leg. Using experimental data on whole-body kinematics of unrestrained walking and climbing stick insects, we show that these movement primitives can be used to signal particular step cycle phases, but also step cycle transitions such as leg lift-off. Additionally, third-order interneurons are introduced to indicate climbing behaviour, for example by encoding the body pitch angle from 6x3 local leg joints. All encoding properties are validated against annotated experimental data, allowing for relevance rating of particular leg types and/or leg joint actions for all measures encoded. Our results demonstrate that simple combinations of two or three position/velocity inputs from disjunct hair field arrays are sufficient to encode high-order movement information about step cycle phases. The resulting movement primitive encoding may converge to represent particular locomotor states and whole-body posture.

">A spiking neural network model for proprioception of limb kinematics in insect locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Proprioception plays a key role in all behaviours that involve the control of force, posture or movement. Computationally, many proprioceptive afferents share three common features: First, their strictly local encoding of stimulus magnitudes leads to range fractionation in sensory arrays. As a result, encoding of large joint angle ranges requires integration of convergent afferent information by first-order interneurons. Second, their phasic-tonic response properties lead to fractional encoding of the fundamental sensory magnitude and its derivatives (e.g., joint angle and angular velocity). Third, the distribution of disjunct sensory arrays across the body accounts for distributed encoding of complex movements, e.g., at multiple joints or by multiple limbs. The present study models the distributed encoding of limb kinematics, proposing a multi-layer spiking neural network for distributed computation of whole-body posture and movement. Spiking neuron models are biologically plausible because they link the sub-threshold state of neurons to the timing of spike events. The encoding properties of each network layer are evaluated with experimental data on whole-body kinematics of unrestrained walking and climbing stick insects, comprising concurrent joint angle time courses of 6x3 leg joints. The first part of the study models strictly local, phasic-tonic encoding of joint angle by proprioceptive hair field afferents by use of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire neurons. Convergent afferent information is then integrated by two types of first-order interneurons, modelled as Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons, tuned to encode either joint position or velocity across the entire working range with high accuracy. As in known velocity-encoding antennal mechanosensory interneurons, spike rate increases linearly with angular velocity. Building on distributed position/velocity encoding, the second part of the study introduces second- and third-order interneurons. We demonstrate that simple combinations of two or three position/velocity inputs from disjunct arrays can encode high-order movement information about step cycle phases and converge to encode overall body posture.

">Astrocyte-derived PEA116 increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis and confers stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the neurogenic niche regulates several steps of adult neurogenesis, from the proliferation to the integration of newly formed neurons in the hippocampal network. However, the role of astrocytes in the regulation of adult neural stem cell (aNSC) proliferation is still little described. Here, we found that blocking vesicular release from astrocytes decreased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, resulting in impaired adult neurogenesis. Inversely, astrocyte-conditioned medium increased cell proliferation in a vesicular release-dependent manner. We identified PEA116 as a peptide released by astrocytes, that is derived from the c-terminal portion of the PEA15 protein and increased cell proliferation. PEA116 increased ERK2 phosphorylation, decreased the expression of genes involved in aNSC quiescence, resulting in aNSC quiescence exit. The ensuing increase in hippocampal neurogenesis improved resilience to chronic stress. These findings highlight a novel peptide produced by astrocytes that regulates the early steps of adult neurogenesis, with an implication for mood disorders.

                Microglia are highly motile cells that play a crucial role in the central nervous system in health and disease. Here we show that actin depolymerizing factors ADF and Cofilin1 (Cfl1) are key factors of microglia integrity and function. We found a profound morphological phenotype in absence of ADF and Cfl1 in microglia. In vivo two-photon imaging of microglia with ADF/Cfl1-KO revealed reduced microglial fine processes motility and impaired microglia migration towards a laser-induced lesion. We found increased accumulation of stabilized F-actin and altered microtubule dynamics in ADF/Cfl1-KO microglia, indicating that ADF/Cfl1 are necessary for microglial cytoskeleton dynamics. Interestingly, microglial ADF/Cfl1-deficiency decreased learning and memory, suggesting that impaired microglial cytoskeleton dynamics affect neuronal functions relevant for cognition. Our results reveal a fundamental role of ADF/Cfl1 in microglia function and underscore the importance of these innate immune cells for higher cognitive functions.

">Overestimation of sex differences in psychostimulant activity via comparisons of males and females from different behavioral groups.</a></h4>

              
                Background: There are inconsistencies in the observation of sex differences in baseline activity and psychostimulant activity. To address this, we have developed the MISSING (Mapping Intrinsic Sex Similarities as an Integral quality of Normalized Groups) model. MISSING model proposes that sex similarities are observed when we compare similar behavioral groups of males and females, with sex differences occurring when we compare distinct groups of sexes, but this model has not been tested. Methods: To test this model, we identified within-sex groups of Sprague Dawley rats (male n = 22, female n = 23) by conducted normal mixtures clustering of baseline activity, cocaine activity (as distance traveled in cm over 90 min) and cocaine activity normalized-to-baseline activity (NBA) of all subjects. We employed 2-way ANOVA to determine the impact of within-sex heterogeneity on sex differences. We compared our cluster-based method to current median-split approaches.Results: Our new cluster-based method revealed three distinct clusters, each consisting of both males and females. We determined there were no sex differences in any of the variables when males and females from the same clusters were compared. The within-sex clusters for females were not defined by estrous phase. Median split analysis was ineffective in accurately identifying within-sex groups. Conclusions: Our results validate the MISSING model: there are no sex differences in psychostimulant activity except when we compare males and females from different behavioral groups. This has significant implications for how we proceed with research towards understanding the mechanism governing sex differences in psychostimulant activity.

">Rhythmic Sampling and Competition of Target and Distractor in a Motion Detection Task</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that the visual system samples attended information rhythmically. Does rhythmic sampling also apply to distracting information? How do attended information and distracting information compete temporally for neural representations? We recorded electroencephalography from participants who detected instances of coherent motion in a random dot kinematogram (RDK; the target stimulus), overlayed on different categories (pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant) of affective images from the International Affective System (IAPS), serving as distractors. The moving dots were flickered at 4.29 Hz whereas the IAPS pictures were flickered at 6 Hz. The time course of spectral power at 4.29 Hz (dot response) was taken to index the temporal dynamics of target processing. The spatial pattern of the power at 6 Hz was similarly extracted and subjected to a MVPA decoding analysis to index the temporal dynamics of processing pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant distractor pictures. We found that (1) both target processing and distractor processing exhibited rhythmicity at ~1 Hz and (2) the phase difference between the two rhythmic time courses were related to task performance, i.e., relative phase closer to {pi} predicted a higher rate of coherent motion detection whereas relative phase closer to 0 predicted a lower rate of coherent motion detection. These results suggest that (1) in a target-distractor scenario, both attended and distracting information were sampled rhythmically and (2) the more target sampling and distractor sampling were separated in time within a sampling cycle, the less distraction effects were observed, both at the neural and the behavioral level.

">Biologically informed cortical models predict optogenetic perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Ideally a recurrent spiking neural network fitted to large electrophysiological data sets should illustrate the chain of cortical information transmission. In particular, successful network model reconstruction methods should enable a model to predict the response to optogenetic perturbations. We propose a method that extracts a recurrent spiking neural network from electrophysiological data sets and test it on unseen optogenetic interventions. Our method uses multiple objectives to reproduce various aspects of neuronal activity patterns as well as biology-based inductive biases like structured connectivity and separation of neurons into dominant excitatory and inhibitory cell types. We show that theses biological inductive biases are crucial to predict responses to optogenetic perturbations. Furthermore, once a model is fitted to experimental data, gradient evaluations in the extracted model network can, in principle, be used to design a minimal low-power optogenetic stimulus that causes a maximal effect by stimulating a limited subset of neurons. Our computational methods provide a systematic path towards translating observed spike data into a matching recurrent neural network that is able to predict the results of a variety of experimental interventions.

">Spatial learning in feature-impoverished environments in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ability to return to memorized goal locations is essential for animal survival. While it is well documented that animals use visual landmarks to locate goals, how they navigate spatial learning tasks in environments lacking such landmarks remains poorly understood. Here, using a high-throughput spatial learning task we developed to investigate this question in Drosophila, we found that Drosophila can simultaneously use self-generated olfactory cues and self-motion cues to learn a spatial goal under visually challenging conditions. Specifically, flies mark a rewarded goal location with self-deposited scents, to which they assign a positive value to, and use these scents and their self-motion cues to guide them back to the goal. This learning process is mediated by the mushroom body(MB) - an olfactory learning center responsible for associating odors with reinforcement - and by PFN neurons, which encode egocentric translational velocity, a self-motion cue. Intriguingly, when the environment is enriched with prominent external olfactory landmarks, flies shift their strategy, prioritizing these landmarks over self-generated cues. Our findings demonstrate that Drosophila can dynamically adapt to environmental complexities when solving spatial learning tasks by creating and integrating internal and external cues, revealing an unexpected level of sophistication in their cognitive capacities.

">A Kinematic Deviation Index (KDI) for Evaluation of Forelimb Function in Rodents</a></h4>

              
                Rodent models are widely used to study neurological conditions and assess forelimb movement to measure function performance, deficit, recovery and treatment effectiveness. Traditional assessment methods based on endpoints such as whether the task is accomplished, while easy to implement, provide limited information on movement patterns important to assess different functional strategies. On the other side, detailed kinematic analysis provides granular information on the movement patterns but is difficult to compare across laboratories, and may not translate to clinical metrics of upper limb function. To address these limitations, we developed and validated a kinematic deviation index (KDI) for rodents that mimics current trends in clinical research. The KDI is a unitless summary score that quantifies the difference between an animal movement during a task and its optimal performance derived from spatiotemporal marker sequences without pre-specifying movements. We demonstrate the utility of KDI in assessing reaching and grasping in mice and validate its discrimination between trial endpoints in healthy animals. Furthermore, we show KDI sensitivity to interventions, including acute and chronic spinal cord injury and optogenetic disruption of sensorimotor circuits. The KDI provides a comprehensive measure of motor function that bridges the gap between detailed kinematic analysis and simple success/failure metrics, offering a valuable tool for assessing recovery and compensation in rodent models of neurological disorders.

">Reproducible Sex Differences in Personalized Functional Network Topography in Youth</a></h4>

              
                A key step towards understanding psychiatric disorders that disproportionately impact female mental health is delineating the emergence of sex-specific patterns of brain organization at the critical transition from childhood to adolescence. Prior work suggests that individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks across the cortex are associated with psychopathology and differ systematically by sex. We aimed to evaluate the impact of sex on the spatial organization of person-specific functional brain networks. We leveraged person-specific atlases of functional brain networks defined using non-negative matrix factorization in a sample of n = 6437 youths from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Across independent discovery and replication samples, we used generalized additive models to uncover associations between sex and the spatial layout ('topography') of personalized functional networks (PFNs). Next, we trained support vector machines to classify participants' sex from multivariate patterns of PFN topography. Finally, we leveraged transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to evaluate spatial correlations between sex differences in PFN topography and gene expression. Sex differences in PFN topography were greatest in association networks including the fronto-parietal, ventral attention, and default mode networks. Machine learning models trained on participants' PFNs were able to classify participant sex with high accuracy. Brain regions with the greatest sex differences in PFN topography were enriched in expression of X-linked genes as well as genes expressed in astrocytes and excitatory neurons. Sex differences in PFN topography are robust, replicate across large-scale samples of youth, and are associated with expression patterns of X-linked genes. These results suggest a potential contributor to the female-biased risk in depressive and anxiety disorders that emerge at the transition from childhood to adolescence.

">Molecular and Neural Circuit Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Experience-dependent Long-Term Memory in Drosophila.</a></h4>

              
                The neural and molecular underpinnings of sexual experience-dependent long-term memory (SELTM) in male Drosophila melanogaster remain poorly understood, despite its significance for reproductive success. Here, we dissect the role of a specific class of neurons, termed 'Yuelao' (YL) neurons, in the formation of SELTM and the associated molecular pathways. We employed a combination of genetic manipulations, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral assays in Drosophila to investigate the function of YL neurons and their molecular interactors in SELTM. Utilizing the RNA sequencing data and transgenic tools, we delineated the neural circuits involved in taste and pheromone processing relevant to SELTM. Our findings reveal that the YL neurons, expressing the Orb2 scaffolding protein, are indispensable for the formation of SELTM following sexual experience. These neurons are regulated by the neuromodulator short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and its receptor (sNPF-R), which modulate glutamate release via NMDAR2. We demonstrate that sexual experience triggers synaptic plasticity in YL neurons, characterized by an increase in dendritic and presynaptic terminal areas, and a decrease in intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, we show that YL neurons are specialized for the generation of appetitive sexual experience-dependent memory and project to brain regions implicated in memory formation. Our study uncovers the YL neurons as a key neural substrate for SELTM in Drosophila, shedding light on the molecular and circuit mechanisms that mediate the formation of long-term memories following sexual experience. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of taste-related memory and have broader implications for understanding the interplay between experience, memory formation, and behavior.

                We present an enhancer AAV toolbox for accessing and perturbing striatal cell types and circuits. Best-in-class vectors were curated for accessing major striatal neuron populations including medium spiny neurons (MSNs), direct and indirect pathway MSNs, as well as Sst-Chodl, Pvalb-Pthlh, and cholinergic interneurons. Specificity was evaluated by multiple modes of molecular validation, three different routes of virus delivery, and with diverse transgene cargos. Importantly, we provide detailed information necessary to achieve reliable cell type specific labeling under different experimental contexts. We demonstrate direct pathway circuit-selective optogenetic perturbation of behavior and multiplex labeling of striatal interneuron types for targeted analysis of cellular features. Lastly, we show conserved in vivo activity for exemplary MSN enhancers in rat and macaque. This collection of striatal enhancer AAVs offers greater versatility compared to available transgenic lines and can readily be applied for cell type and circuit studies in diverse mammalian species beyond the mouse model.

">Cannabis smoke and oral Δ9THC enhance working memory in aged but not young adult subjects</a></h4>

              
                With increased legalization of recreational and medical cannabis, use of this drug is growing rapidly among older adults. As cannabis use can impair cognition in young adults, it is critically important to understand how consumption interacts with the cognitive profile of aged individuals, who are already at increased risk of decline. The current study was designed to determine how cannabis influences multiple forms of cognition in young adult and aged rats of both sexes when delivered via two translationally-relevant routes of administration. Acute exposure to cannabis smoke enhanced prefrontal cortex-dependent working memory accuracy in aged males, but impaired accuracy in aged females, while having no effects in young adults of either sex. In contrast, the same cannabis smoke exposure regimen had minimal effects on a hippocampus-dependent trial-unique non-matching to location mnemonic task, irrespective of age or sex. In a second set of experiments, chronic oral consumption of {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({Delta}9THC) enhanced working memory in aged rats of both sexes, while having no effects in young adults. In contrast, the same oral {Delta}9THC regimen did not affect spatial learning and memory in either age group. Minimal age differences were observed in {Delta}9THC pharmacokinetics with either route of administration. Together, these results show that cannabis and {Delta}9THC can attenuate working memory impairments that emerge in aging. While these enhancing effects do not extend to hippocampus-dependent cognition, cannabis does not appear to exacerbate age-associated impairments in this cognitive domain.

">Amphetamine increases timing variability by degrading prefrontal ramping activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Amphetamine is a commonly abused psychostimulant that increases synaptic catecholamine levels and impairs executive functions. However, it is unknown how acute amphetamine affects brain areas involved in executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex. We studied this problem in mice using interval timing, which requires participants to estimate an interval of several seconds with a motor response. Rodent prefrontal cortex ensembles are required for interval timing. We tested the hypothesis that amphetamine disrupts interval timing by degrading prefrontal cortex temporal encoding. Methods: We first quantified the effects of amphetamine on interval timing performance by conducting a meta analysis of 11 prior rodent studies. We also implanted multielectrode recording arrays in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of 7 mice and then examined the effects of 1.5 mg/kg D amphetamine injected intraperitoneally on interval timing behavior and prefrontal neuronal ensemble activity. Results: A meta analysis of previous literature revealed that amphetamine produces a large effect size on interval timing variability across studies but only a medium effect size on central tendencies of interval timing. We found a similar effect on interval timing variability in our task, which was accompanied by greater trial to trial variability in prefrontal ramping, attenuated interactions between pairs of ramping neurons, and dampened low frequency oscillations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that amphetamine alters prefrontal temporal processing by increasing the variability of prefrontal ramping. Our work provides insight into how amphetamine affects timing related brain activity, which may be useful in developing new neurophysiological markers for amphetamine use and novel treatments targeting the prefrontal cortex.

">Dnmt1-deficiency in PV interneurons alters cortical circuit function and leads to depression-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), are highly prevalent in modern society, arising from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Alterations in the function of cortical inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, along with dysregulations of epigenetic signatures and key regulators such as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), have been implicated in these conditions. Through its role in catalyzing DNA methylation, DNMT1 modulates the synaptic activity of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons, which are essential for cortical inhibition. However, the functional consequences of DNMT1 activity in cortical interneurons at the network level and its impact on behavior remain unknown and must be explored to fully understand the disease implications of dysregulated DNMT1 expression and function. To address this, we utilized a conditional knockout mouse model with Dnmt1 deletion in PV interneurons. Our findings reveal that a Dnmt1 deficiency leads to increased spontaneous firing rates of cortical neurons, reduced cortical gamma oscillations, and altered visually evoked neural responses. Despite intact sensory perception, Dnmt1-deficient mice exhibited reduced physical activity, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and signs of anhedonia and apathy, which represent core features of MDD. These results underscore the critical role of DNMT1 in PV interneuron function and identify it as a potential target for MDD research.

">Natural variations in maternal behaviour shape trait anxiety and hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the early origins of emotional traits and baseline anxiety is crucial for the development of personalized medicine in mood disorders. While previous research primarily focused on extreme conditions like chronic maternal deprivation, in the present study, we investigated how natural variations in maternal care influence anxiety-related behaviour and neurogenesis in C57BL/6J offspring in a longitudinal manner. We observed that mothers engaging in low maternal care (LMC) displayed lower adult neurogenesis in both the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared to high maternal care (HMC) mothers. We then observed that LMC-reared pups exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviour at postnatal day (PND) 5, 9, and 22. Furthermore, maternal behaviour induced the development of emotional individuality at early stage. This mood-related phenotype in LMC-reared offspring was associated with decreased neurogenesis after weaning at PND24. In another group of litters, we further examined neurogenesis at an earlier age (PND9) and already found a reduction in the population of adult neural progenitor cells and cell proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of LMC-reared pups. These results highlight that natural variations in early life experiences such as maternal care, shape long-term brain plasticity and behaviour in offspring. This underscores the relevance of maternal care and adult neurogenesis in shaping personality-like traits related to mood disorders.

	<p>Background: In the oddball paradigm, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is often associated with active cognitive responses, such as maintaining information in working memory or adapting response strategies. While some evidence points to the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in passive auditory deviance perception, a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal neurodynamics involved remains unclear. Methods: In this study, event-related optical signals (EROS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were simultaneously recorded for the first time over the prefrontal cortex using a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system, during passive auditory deviance perception in 12 right-handed young adults (7 women and 5 men). In this oddball paradigm, deviant stimuli (a 1500 Hz pure tone) elicited a negative shift in the N1 ERP component, related to mismatch negativity (MMN), and a significant positive deflection associated with the P300, compared to standard stimuli (a 1000 Hz tone). Results: We hypothesize that the DLPFC not only participates in active tasks but also plays a critical role in processing deviant stimuli in passive conditions, shifting from pre-attentive to attentive processing. We detected enhanced neural activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), at the same timing of the MMN component, followed by later activation at the timing of the P3a ERP component in the right MFG. Conclusions: Understanding these dynamics will provide deeper insights into the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in evaluating the novelty or unexpectedness of the deviant stimulus, updating its cognitive value, and adjusting future predictions accordingly. However, the small number of subjects could limit the generalizability of the observations, in particular with respect to the effect of handedness, and additional studies with larger and more diverse samples are necessary to validate our conclusions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To assess spatial contrast sensitivity (CS) in suspected primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Methods: CS was measured using sinusoidal gratings of 4 cycles/degree. First, foveal and peripheral CS were assessed in 34 suspected POAG patients and compared with 71 and 28 age-matched healthy individuals for foveal and peripheral conditions, respectively. Second, foveal CS was assessed in 34 early POAG patients age-matched with suspected POAG patients. Analyses were performed considering two age ranges: Under and Over 50 y.o. Correlations were evaluated between CS and clinical parameters. Diagnostic accuracy was also analyzed. Results: Peripheral CS was lower in older suspected POAG patients (23.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.1) than the control group (39.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28.2) (p = 0.040). Foveal CS was reduced in suspected POAG participants (Under 50: 146.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 63.3; p = 0.004. Over 50: 110.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 65.0; p = 0.044) and in early POAG patients (Under 50: 141.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 72.6; p = 0.002. Over 50: 80.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 54.5 p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), both compared to the control group (Under 50: 213.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 66.2. Over 50: 138.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 71.7). CS was lower in early POAG than in POAG suspected in older patients (p = 0.042). Foveal CS was correlated with age (Early: p = 0.001. Suspect: p = 0.002) and with the cup&amp;amp;ndash;disc ratio only in early POAG patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Foveal CS had fair (AUC = 0.74) diagnostic accuracy for early POAG patients. Conclusions: CS in suspected POAG patients is lower than in healthy individuals. Our findings evidence the spatial vision loss before the onset of POAG.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the involvement of progressive brain alterations in epilepsy was recently suggested, individual patients&amp;amp;rsquo; trajectories of white matter (WM) disruption are not known. Methods: We investigated the disease progression patterns of WM damage and its associations with clinical metrics. We examined the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 155 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 270 age/gender-matched healthy controls, and we then calculated the average fractional anisotropy (FA) values within 20 WM tracts of the whole brain. We used the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) program to detect the progression trajectory of FA changes and investigated its association with clinical parameters including onset age, disease duration, drug-responsiveness, and the number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Results: The SuStaIn algorithm identified a single subtype model in which the initial damage occurs in the ipsilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF), followed by damage in the forceps, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). This pattern was replicated when analyzing TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (n = 50) and TLE with no lesions (n = 105) separately. Further-progressed stages were associated with longer disease duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a greater number of ASMs (p = 0.001). Conclusions: the disease progression model based on WM tracts may be useful as a novel individual-level biomarker.</p>

	<p>The acute levodopa challenge is widely used to distinguish Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In APSs, very few patients present a clinically relevant response to levodopa. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with atypical parkinsonism benefit from levodopa in any aspect of their multiple motor deficits despite the generally poor response. This retrospective study analyzed individual motor responses to the acute levodopa challenge using the MDS-UPDRS III in 47 PSP, 26 MSA, and 71 PD patients at Hannover Medical School. Despite the generally poor levodopa response in both PSP and MSA patients, bradykinesia and rigidity were the symptoms most notably affected by levodopa in PSP patients, while MSA patients experienced significant improvements in bradykinesia and action tremor. These findings underscore the variability in levodopa response among PSP and MSA patients and highlight the need for personalized treatment approaches in atypical parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>The landscape of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) has undergone significant transformations with the advent of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting &amp;amp;beta;-Amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) accumulation, one of the hallmark pathologies of AD. The approval and market introduction of monoclonal antibodies mark the dawn of a new era in AD therapeutics as well. Furthermore, considerable progress has also been made in the development of new drugs targeting non-A&amp;amp;beta; and non-Tau protein pathways. These advancements are key in tackling the root causes of AD, offering hope for treatments that both relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the advances in drug development and application for AD, including those currently in clinical trials and those already approved for the market to treat patients.</p>

">Fast hierarchical processing of orthographic and semantic parafoveal information during natural reading</a></h4>

              
                Readers extract orthographic and semantic information from parafoveal words before fixating on them. While this has to be achieved within an intersaccadic interval, the neuronal mechanisms supporting this fast parafoveal word processing within the language network remain unknown. We co-registered MEG and eye-tracking data in a natural reading paradigm to uncover the neuronal mechanisms supporting parafoveal processing. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that parafoveal orthographic neighbours (e.g., "writer" vs. "waiter") showed higher representational similarity than non-neighbours (e.g., "writer" vs. "police"), emerging ~68 ms after fixation onset on the preceding word (e.g., "clever") in the visual word form area. Similarly, parafoveal semantic neighbours (e.g., "writer" vs. "author") exhibited increased representational similarity at ~137 ms in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Importantly, the degree of orthographic and semantic parafoveal processing predicted individual reading speed. Our findings suggest fast hierarchical processing of parafoveal words across distinct brain regions, which enhances reading efficiency.

">Comparative Analysis of AAV Serotypes for Transduction of Olfactory Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory sensory neurons within the nasal epithelium detect volatile odorants and relay odor information to the central nervous system. Unlike other sensory inputs, olfactory sensory neurons interface with the external environment and project their axons directly into the central nervous system. The use of adeno-associated viruses to target these neurons has garnered interest for applications in gene therapy, probing olfactory sensory neuron biology, and modeling disease. To date, there is no consensus on the optimal AAV serotype for efficient and selective transduction of olfactory sensory neurons in vivo. Here we utilized serial confocal imaging and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to evaluate the efficacy of 11 different AAV serotypes in transducing murine olfactory sensory neurons via non-invasive nasal inoculation. Our results reveal that AAV1, while highly effective, exhibited broad tropism, whereas AAV-DJ/8 showed the greatest specificity for olfactory sensory neurons.

">Connectivity in the Dorsal Visual Stream is Enhanced in Action Video Game Players</a></h4>

              
                Action video games foster competitive environments that demand rapid spatial navigation and decision-making. Action video gamers often exhibit faster response times and slightly improved accuracy in vision-based sensorimotor tasks. However, the underlying functional and structural changes in the two visual streams of the brain that may be contributing to these cognitive improvements have been unclear. Using functional and diffusion MRI data, this study investigated the differences in connectivity between gamers who play action video games and nongamers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams. We found that action video gamers have enhanced functional and structural connectivity, especially in the dorsal visual stream. Specifically, there is heightened functional connectivity both undirected and directed between the left Superior Occipital Gyrus and the left Superior Parietal Lobule during a moving-dots discrimination decision-making task. This increased connectivity correlates with response time in gamers. The structural connectivity, as quantified by diffusion fractional anisotropy and quantitative anisotropy measures of the axonal fiber pathways between the same regions was also enhanced for gamers compared to nongamers. These findings provide valuable insights into how action video gaming can induce targeted neuroplastic changes, enhancing structural and functional connectivity between specific brain regions in the visual processing pathways. These connectivity changes in the dorsal visual stream underpin the superior performance of action video gamers compared to non-gamers in tasks requiring rapid and accurate vision-based decision-making.

">A hierarchical Bayesian model reveals increased precision weighting for afferent cardiac signals, and reduced anxiety, as a function of interoceptive training</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual accuracy for interoceptive signals, such as heartbeats, varies in a trait-like manner across individuals and may influence the capacity for emotion regulation and vulnerability to affective symptoms, notably anxiety. Here, we demonstrate that an interoceptive training protocol improved perceptual accuracy in two tasks of heartbeat perception and reduced both state and trait anxiety in a subclinical sample, extending previous findings in autistic adults. Computational modelling indicated that accuracy improvement in the heartbeat discrimination task was associated with increases in the internal reliability estimate for interoceptive signals - their precision weighting - while a lower-level parameter representing noise in the interoceptive signal itself (which influences speed of learning) moderated this precision weighting improvement. Reductions in both state and trait anxiety in the training group were uniquely explained by computational parameter estimates, and not by conventional accuracy measures. These findings indicate that trait-like differences in interoceptive processing are modifiable and can be targeted to alleviate anxiety symptoms, and that interoceptive interventions may be best guided by a computational phenotyping approach.

">Potentiation of active locomotor state by spinal-projecting serotonergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Animals produce diverse motor actions that enable expression of context-appropriate behaviors. Neuromodulators facilitate behavioral flexibility by altering the temporal dynamics and output of neural circuits. Discrete populations of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons target circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord, but their role in the control of motor behavior is unclear. Here we define the pre- and post-synaptic organization of the spinal-projecting serotonergic system and define a role in locomotor control. We show that while forebrain-targeting 5-HT neurons decrease their activity during locomotion, subpopulations of spinal projecting neurons increase their activity in a context-dependent manner. Optogenetic activation of ventrally projecting 5-HT neurons does not trigger initiation of movement, but rather enhances the speed and duration of ongoing locomotion over extended time scales. These findings indicate that the descending serotonergic system potentiates locomotor output and demonstrate a role for serotonergic neurons in modulating the temporal dynamics of motor circuits.

">Charting Cortical-Layer Specific Area Boundaries Using Gibbs Ringing Attenuated T1w/T2w-FLAIR Myelin MRI</a></h4>

              
                Cortical areas have traditionally been defined by their distinctive layer cyto- and/or myelo- architecture using postmortem histology. Recent studies have delineated many areas by measuring overall cortical myelin content and its spatial gradients using the T1w/T2w ratio MRI in living primates, including humans. While T1w/T2w studies of areal transitions might benefit from using the layer profile of this myelin-related contrast, a significant confound is Gibbs ringing artefact, which produces signal fluctuations resembling cortical layers. Here, we address these issues with a novel approach using cortical layer thickness-adjusted T1w/T2w-FLAIR imaging, which effectively cancels out Gibbs ringing artefacts while enhancing intra-cortical myelin contrast. Whole-brain MRI measures were mapped onto twelve equivolumetric layers, and layer-specific sharp myeloarchitectonic transitions were identified using spatial gradients resulting in a putative 182 area/subarea partition of the macaque cerebral cortex. The myelin maps exhibit unexpectedly high homology with humans suggesting cortical myelin shares the same developmental program across the species. Comparison with histological Gallyas myelin stains explains over 80% of the variance in the laminar T1w/T2w-FLAIR profiles, substantiating the validity of the method. Altogether, our approach provides a novel, noninvasive means for precision mapping layer myeloarchitecture in the primate cerebral cortex, advancing the pioneering work of classical neuroanatomists.

">HEXIM1 is correlated with Alzheimer's disease pathology and regulates immediate early gene dynamics in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Impaired memory formation and recall is a distinguishing feature of Alzheimer's disease, and memory requires de novo gene transcription in neurons. Rapid and robust transcription of many genes is facilitated by their existence in a basal poised state, in which RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) has initiated transcription, but is paused just downstream of the gene promoter. Neuronal depolarization releases the paused RNAP2 to complete the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Paused RNAP2 release is controlled by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is sequestered into a larger inactive complex containing Hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) under basal conditions. In this work, we find that neuronal expression of HEXIM1 mRNA is highly correlated with human Alzheimer's disease pathologies. Furthermore, P-TEFb regulation by HEXIM1 has a significant impact on the rapid induction of neuronal gene transcription, particularly in response to repeated neuronal depolarization. These data indicate that HEXIM1/P-TEFb has an important role in inducible gene transcription in neurons, and for setting and resetting the poised state that allows for the robust activation of genes necessary for synaptic plasticity.

">Somatostatin interneurons select dorsomedial striatal representations of the initial learning phase</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is an associative node involved in the adaptation of ongoing actions to the environmental context and in the initial formation of motor sequences. In early associative or motor learning phases, DMS activity shows a global decrease in neuron firing, eventually giving rise to a select group of active cells, whose number is correlated with animal performance. Unveiling how those representation emerge from DMS circuits is crucial for understanding plasticity mechanisms of early adjustments to learning a task. Here, we hypothesized that inhibitory microcircuits formed by local interneurons are responsible for the genesis of early DMS representation and associated task performance. Despite the low density of somatostatin (SOM)-positive cells, we observed that selective manipulation of SOM cells disrupted reorganization of DMS activity and modulated initial phases of learning in two behavioral contexts. This effect was cell-specific as manipulation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons had no significant effect. Finally, we identified the high plasticity of SOM innervation in the DMS as a key modulator of the SPN excitability and firing activity. Hence, SOM interneurons set the pace of early learning by actively controlling the remapping of DMS network activity.

">A Novel Mouse Model Demonstrates In Vivo Replenishment of Central Nervous System Pericytes After Successful Acute Ablation</a></h4>

              
                Central nervous system (CNS) pericytes play crucial roles in vascular development and blood-brain barrier maturation during prenatal development, as well as in regulating cerebral blood flow in adults. They have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders. However, the behavior of pericytes in the adult brain after injury remains poorly understood, partly due to limitations in existing pericyte ablation models. To investigate pericyte responses following acute ablation, we developed a tamoxifen-inducible pericyte ablation model by crossing PDGFR{beta}-P2A-CreERT2 and Rosa26-DTA176 transgenic mouse lines. Using this model, we studied the effects of different tamoxifen doses and conducted histological examinations 15 and 60 days post-injection to assess both short- and long-term impacts of pericyte ablation. Our results demonstrate that a low dose of tamoxifen effectively ablates CNS pericytes in mice without reducing survival or causing significant systemic side effects, such as weight loss. Additionally, we found that the extent of pericyte depletion varies between the cortex and the spinal cord's gray and white matter regions. Importantly, both pericyte coverage and numbers increased in the weeks following acute ablation, indicating the regenerative capacity of CNS pericytes in vivo. This model offers a valuable tool for future studies on the role of pericytes in neurological disorders, overcoming the limitations of constitutive pericyte ablation models.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural decoding methods are often limited by the performance of brain encoders, which map complex brain signals into a latent representation space of perception information. These brain encoders are constrained by the limited amount of paired brain and stimuli data available for training, making it challenging to learn rich neural representations. Methods: To address this limitation, we present a novel multimodal training approach using paired image and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to establish a brain masked autoencoder that learns the interactions between images and brain activities. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion model conditioned on brain data to decode realistic images. Results: Our method achieves high-quality decoding results in semantic contents and low-level visual attributes, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, our method is applied to decode artificial patterns across region of interests (ROIs) to explore their functional properties. We not only validate existing knowledge concerning ROIs but also unveil new insights, such as the synergy between early visual cortex and higher-level scene ROIs, as well as the competition within the higher-level scene ROIs. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for future directions in the field of neural decoding.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental health issues are increasingly prominent worldwide, posing significant threats to patients and deeply affecting their families and social relationships. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective and delayed, indicating the need for an objective and effective early diagnosis method. Methods: To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight detection method for multi-mental disorders with fewer data sources, aiming to improve diagnostic procedures and enable early patient detection. First, the proposed method takes Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as sources, acquires brain rhythms through Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (DWT), and extracts their approximate entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and sample entropy to establish the entropy-based matrix. Then, six kinds of conventional machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Decision Tree (DT), are adopted for the entropy-based matrix to achieve the detection task. Their performances are assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Concerning these experiments, three public datasets of schizophrenia, epilepsy, and depression are utilized for method validation. Results: The analysis of the results from these datasets identifies the representative single-channel signals (schizophrenia: O1, epilepsy: F3, depression: O2), satisfying classification accuracies (88.10%, 75.47%, and 89.92%, respectively) with minimal input. Conclusions: Such performances are impressive when considering fewer data sources as a concern, which also improves the interpretability of the entropy features in EEG, providing a reliable detection approach for multi-mental disorders and advancing insights into their underlying mechanisms and pathological states.</p>

	<p>Background: Intravenous thrombolysis is one of the most effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with urokinase offering a cost-effective alternative to newer agents like alteplase and tenecteplase, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of intravenous thrombolysis with urokinase for AIS in the clinical practice of stroke management, including the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of urokinase compared to other thrombolytic agents. Results: Urokinase, a first-generation thrombolytic drug, is a non-specific plasminogen activator that offers a cost-effective alternative. It has been used in clinical practice for over two decades to improve neurological outcomes in patients with AIS if administered within 6 h of ictus. Numerous studies have indicated that urokinase remains a viable option for patients who cannot access alteplase or tenecteplase because of economic constraints, time window limitations, availability, or other reasons. Conclusions: In low- and middle-income countries, urokinase is a cost-effective alternative thrombolytic drug. High-level evidence-based medical research is therefore urgently needed to confirm that urokinase is not inferior to new-generation thrombolytic drugs, and to assess whether it may even be superior in some patient populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits following ischemic stroke significantly impair quality of life, highlighting the need for effective interventions. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended N-Pep-12 dietary supplementation in enhancing cognitive recovery post-stroke. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, controlled study, 106 patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke were enrolled to receive either 90mg N-Pep-12 or no supplementation daily for 360 days and were followed-up for 360 days. Cognitive function and emotional well-being were assessed using established neuropsychological scales at baseline, 90 days, and 360 days post-stroke. Safety was monitored through adverse events and mortality rates. Results: Significant improvements were observed in the N-Pep-12 group compared to controls, particularly in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at both 90 and 360 days, and in the Digit Symbol Coding scores at 360 days, suggesting enhanced cognitive recovery with extended N-Pep-12 supplementation. A linear regression for a composite outcome analysis at day 360 further confirmed the efficacy of N-Pep-12 in contributing to cognitive improvement. Safety profiles were favorable, with no significant adverse effects attributed to N-Pep-12. Conclusions: Extended dietary supplementation with N-Pep-12 appears to offer a safe and effective approach to support cognitive recovery in ischemic stroke survivors. These findings underscore the potential of the supplement as an add-on intervention for managing post-stroke cognitive impairments.</p>

	<p>Objectives. There is a significant correlation between EEG microstate and the neurophysiological basis of mental illness, brain state, and cognitive function. Given that the unclear relationship between network dynamics and different microstates, this paper utilized microstate, brain network, and control theories to understand the microstate characteristics of short-term memory task, aiming to mechanistically explain the most influential microstates and brain regions driving the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We identified each microstate and analyzed the microstate abnormalities in schizophrenia patients during short-term memory tasks. Subsequently, the network dynamics underlying the primary microstates were studied to reveal the relationships between network dynamics and microstates. Finally, using control theory, we confirmed that the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in schizophrenia patients are driven by specific microstates and brain regions. Results. The frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly, but the left frontal lobe of microstate B increased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the easy-to-reach states. However, the frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the hard-to-reach states. Microstate D showed that the right-frontal activity had a higher priority than the left-frontal, but microstate B showed that the left-frontal priority decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when changes occur in the synchronization state of the brain. Conclusions. In conclusion, microstate D may be a biomarker candidate of brain abnormal activity during the states transitions in schizophrenia, and microstate B may represent a compensatory mechanism that maintains brain function and exchanges information with other brain regions. Microstate and brain network provide complementary perspectives on the neurodynamics, offering potential insights into brain function in health and disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits in prison populations and offenders. Due to misleading headlines and highly publicized criminal cases, the belief that autistic individuals are more prone to commit crimes has spread among the general population, also leading to increasing research on this matter. Aims: In this context, this narrative review aimed to analyze the available scientific literature on the bi-directional link between ASD and criminal behaviors and to assess the key characteristics of eventual ASD offenders, including sociodemographic data, comorbidities, crime-related features, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Results: Our review highlighted that the available studies lack methodological rigor and present controversial results. Overall, the current state of research does not support any definitive correlation between ASD or autistic traits and the predisposition to engage in criminal conduct. Further studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p>

	<p>The delivery of nutrients to the brain is provided by a 600 km network of capillaries and microvessels. Indeed, the brain is highly energy demanding and, among a total amount of 100 billion neurons, each neuron is located just 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 &amp;amp;mu;m from a capillary. This vascular network also forms part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), which maintains the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s stable environment by regulating chemical balance, immune cell transport, and blocking toxins. Typically, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) have low turnover, indicating a stable cerebrovascular structure. However, this structure can adapt significantly due to development, aging, injury, or disease. Temporary neural activity changes are managed by the expansion or contraction of arterioles and capillaries. Hypoxia leads to significant remodeling of the cerebrovascular architecture and pathological changes have been documented in aging and in vascular and neurodegenerative conditions. These changes often involve BMEC proliferation and the remodeling of capillary segments, often linked with local neuronal changes and cognitive function. Cerebrovascular plasticity, especially in arterioles, capillaries, and venules, varies over different time scales in development, health, aging, and diseases. Rapid changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) occur within seconds due to increased neural activity. Prolonged changes in vascular structure, influenced by consistent environmental factors, take weeks. Development and aging bring changes over months to years, with aging-associated plasticity often improved by exercise. Injuries cause rapid damage but can be repaired over weeks to months, while neurodegenerative diseases cause slow, varied changes over months to years. In addition, if animal models may provide useful and dynamic in vivo information about vascular plasticity, humans are more complex to investigate and the hypothesis of glymphatic system together with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques could provide useful clues in the future.</p>

	<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) has gained attention owing to its involvement in various physiological functions, such as sleep&amp;amp;ndash;awake, feeding, and emotion, with its analgesic role being particularly significant. It is described as the &amp;amp;ldquo;pain inhibitory nucleus&amp;amp;rdquo; in the brain. The DRN has diverse projections from hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons. In turn, the DRN is a major source of projections to diverse cortex, limbic forebrain thalamus, and the midbrain and contains highly heterogeneous neuronal subtypes. The activation of DRN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition neurons in the DRN are sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain. Recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits and cellular mechanisms in the DRN that are responsible for sensory modulation. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive review addressing the specific neuron types in the DRN involved in pain modulation. This review summarizes the function of specific cell types within DRN in the pain regulation, and aims to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain regulation in the DRN, ultimately offering insights for further exploration.</p>

                <p>There is experimental evidence of varying correlation among the elements of the neuromuscular system over the course of the reach-and-grasp task. The aim of this study was to investigate if modifications in correlations and clustering can be detected in the local field potential (LFP) recordings of the motor cortex during the task. To this end, we analyzed the LFP recordings from a previously published study on monkeys that performed a reach-and-grasp task for targets with a vertical or horizontal orientation. LFP signals were recorded from the motor and premotor cortex of macaque monkeys as they performed the task. We found very robust changes in the correlations of the multielectrode LFP recordings that corresponded to task epochs. Mean LFP correlation increased significantly during reach and then decreased during grasp. This pattern was very robust for both left and right arm reaches irrespective of target orientation. A hierarchical cluster analysis also demonstrated similar changes. In focusing on correlations, our study has contributed new insights to the understanding of LFP signals and their relationship to movement. A sliding window computation of the number of clusters was performed to probe the capacities of the LFP clusters for detecting upcoming task events. For a very high percentage of trials (97.89%), there was a downturn in cluster number following the Pellet Drop (GO signal) that reached a minimum preceding the Start of grasp, hence indicating that cluster analyses of LFPs could contribute to signaling an increased probability of the Start of grasp.</p>

                <p>A new era of disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) arrived in 2021 following the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to grant accelerated approval for aducanumab, an anti-&beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) monoclonal antibody designed to target A&beta; aggregates, a biological component of AD. More recently, trial outcomes for lecanemab and donanemab, two additional antibodies of this drug class, have shown favorable and significant slowing of metrics for cognitive and functional decline. Lecanemab and donanemab have since received similar FDA approval to aducanumab in January 2023 and July 2024, respectively. Given that these therapies are a clearly emerging tool in the repertoire of clinicians treating AD and related dementias, a critical dialogue has been ongoing regarding the potential impacts and place for these therapies. Here, we seek to contextualize this debate by first considering factors involved in theoretically extrapolating current randomized control trial outcomes to estimate meaningful clinical impacts. In the process of this exercise, we outline a generally useful concept termed Summative Treatment-Associated Benefit measuring Long-term Efficacy/Effectiveness Area as a metric of summative benefits of treatment over the life course of an individual. Second, we consider current real-world factors, such as conditions of FDA approval and other points involved in clinical decision-making that will influence and/or temper the actual impacts of this drug class.</p>

                <p>How the human brain reconstructs, step-by-step, the core elements of past experiences is still unclear. Here, we map the spatiotemporal trajectories along which visual object memories are reconstructed during associative recall. Specifically, we inquire whether retrieval reinstates feature representations in a copy-like but reversed direction with respect to the initial perceptual experience, or alternatively, this reconstruction involves format transformations and regions beyond initial perception. Participants from two cohorts studied new associations between verbs and randomly paired object images, and subsequently recalled the objects when presented with the corresponding verb cue. We first analyze multivariate fMRI patterns to map where in the brain high- and low-level object features can be decoded during perception and retrieval, showing that retrieval is dominated by conceptual features, represented in comparatively late visual and parietal areas. A separately acquired EEG dataset is then used to track the temporal evolution of the reactivated patterns using similarity-based EEG&ndash;fMRI fusion. This fusion suggests that memory reconstruction proceeds from anterior frontotemporal to posterior occipital and parietal regions, in line with a conceptual-to-perceptual gradient but only partly following the same trajectories as during perception. Specifically, a linear regression statistically confirms that the sequential activation of ventral visual stream regions is reversed between image perception and retrieval. The fusion analysis also suggests an information relay to frontoparietal areas late during retrieval. Together, the results shed light onto the temporal dynamics of memory recall and the transformations that the information undergoes between the initial experience and its later reconstruction from memory.</p>

                <p>Systemic inflammation has been implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as cognitive impairment and dementia. Recent clinical studies indicate an association between sepsis, endothelial dysfunction, and cognitive decline. However, the investigations of the role and therapeutic potential of the cerebral microvasculature in sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction have been limited by the lack of standardized experimental models for evaluating the alterations in the cerebral microvasculature and cognition induced by the systemic inflammatory response. Herein, we validated a mouse model of endotoxemia that recapitulates key pathophysiology related to sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction, including the induction of an acute systemic hyperinflammatory response, blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurovascular inflammation, and memory impairment after recovery from the systemic inflammation. In the acute phase, we identified novel molecular (e.g., upregulation of plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein, PLVAP, a driver of endothelial permeability, and the procoagulant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1) and functional perturbations (i.e., albumin and small-molecule BBB leakage) in the cerebral microvasculature along with neuroinflammation. Remarkably, small-molecule BBB permeability, elevated levels of PAI-1, intra-/perivascular fibrin/fibrinogen deposition, and microglial activation persisted 1 month after recovery from sepsis. We also highlight molecular neuronal alterations of potential clinical relevance following systemic inflammation including changes in neurofilament phosphorylation and decreases in postsynaptic density protein 95 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting diffuse axonal injury, synapse degeneration, and impaired neurotrophism. Our study serves as a standardized mouse model to support future mechanistic studies of sepsis-associated cognitive dysfunction and to identify novel endothelial therapeutic targets for this devastating condition.</p>

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vascularitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any displacement of catheters’ tip from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be easily coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background The Wheat Crop ontology was created to annotate phenotypic experimental data (i.e. field and greenhouse measurements standardized and integrated in databases). The Wheat Trait and Phenotype ontology was created to annotate information on wheat traits from the literature (i.e. text found in the abstract, results and discussion of scholarly articles). To enable seamless data retrieval on wheat traits from these complementary sources, the classes in the two ontologies have been aligned. Methods All pairs of ontology classes were examined and categorized in nine groups based on the nature of their relationships (e.g. equivalence, subsumption). General principles emerged from this process which were formalized into rules. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) representation was chosen to represent the mappings in RDF (Resource Description Framework), including their metadata such as creators, reviewers, and justification (including rules). Results The mapping dataset is publicly available. It covers 77% of the ontology classes. Most labels of the aligned classes differed significantly and required domain expertise for decisions, especially for traits related to biotic stress. Consequently, most mappings are close mappings rather than exact equivalents. Conclusions We present the end-to-end manual process used to select and represent mappings in SSSOM within the specific domain of wheat traits. We derive general lessons from the complex alignment process that extend beyond the specific case of these two ontologies and more generally apply to alignments of specialized ontologies for information retrieval purposes. This work demonstrates the relevance of SSSOM for representing these mappings.

                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts, suggesting difficulties in retaining recent graduates in academia and in the private sector. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study confirmed the challenges faced by doctoral graduates in integrating into non-academic job markets. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

                <p>by Mengze Zhang, Xia Wang, Sanyi Tang</p>

Aedes mosquitoes, known as vectors of mosquito-borne diseases, pose significant risks to public health and safety. Modeling the population dynamics of Aedes mosquitoes requires comprehensive approaches due to the complex interplay between biological mechanisms and environmental factors. This study developed a model that couples differential equations with a neural network to simulate the dynamics of mosquito population, and explore the relationships between oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation. Data from nine cities in Guangdong Province spanning four years were used for model training and parameter estimation, while data from the remaining three cities were reserved for model validation. The trained model successfully simulated the mosquito population dynamics across all twelve cities using the same set of parameters. Correlation coefficients between simulated results and observed data exceeded 0.7 across all cities, with some cities surpassing 0.85, demonstrating high model performance. The coupled neural network in the model effectively revealed the relationships among oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation, aligning with biological patterns. Furthermore, symbolic regression was used to identify the optimal functional expression for these relationships. By integrating the traditional dynamic model with machine learning, our model can adhere to specific biological mechanisms while extracting patterns from data, thus enhancing its interpretability in biology. Our approach provides both accurate modeling and an avenue for uncovering potential unknown biological mechanisms. Our conclusions can provide valuable insights into designing strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases and developing related prediction and early warning systems.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome. Despite this progress, challenges persist in comprehending the microbiome’s influence on disease, hindered by technical complexities in species classification, abundance estimation, and data compositionality. At the same time, the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities irrespective of their environment has been recently proposed using 16s data and explained by a simple phenomenological model of population dynamics. We here investigate the relationship between dysbiosis, i.e. in unhealthy individuals there are deviations from the “regular” composition of the gut microbial community, and the existence of macro-ecological emergent law in microbial communities. We first quantitatively reconstruct these patterns at the species level using shotgun data, and addressing the consequences of sampling effects and statistical errors on ecological patterns. We then ask if such patterns can discriminate between healthy and unhealthy cohorts. Concomitantly, we evaluate the efficacy of different statistical generative models, which incorporate sampling and population dynamics, to describe such patterns and distinguish which are expected by chance, versus those that are potentially informative about disease states or other biological drivers. A critical aspect of our analysis is understanding the relationship between model parameters, which have clear ecological interpretations, and the state of the gut microbiome, thereby enabling the generation of synthetic compositional data that distinctively represent healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our approach, grounded in theoretical ecology and statistical physics, allows for a robust comparison of these models with empirical data, enhancing our understanding of the strengths and limitations of simple microbial models of population dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012471">The role of training variability for model-based and model-free learning of an arbitrary visuomotor mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos A. Velázquez-Vargas, Nathaniel D. Daw, Jordan A. Taylor</p>

A fundamental feature of the human brain is its capacity to learn novel motor skills. This capacity requires the formation of vastly different visuomotor mappings. Using a grid navigation task, we investigated whether training variability would enhance the flexible use of a visuomotor mapping (key-to-direction rule), leading to better generalization performance. Experiments 1 and 2 show that participants trained to move between multiple start-target pairs exhibited greater generalization to both distal and proximal targets compared to participants trained to move between a single pair. This finding suggests that limited variability can impair decisions even in simple tasks without planning. In addition, during the training phase, participants exposed to higher variability were more inclined to choose options that, counterintuitively, moved the cursor away from the target while minimizing its actual distance under the constrained mapping, suggesting a greater engagement in model-based computations. In Experiments 3 and 4, we showed that the limited generalization performance in participants trained with a single pair can be enhanced by a short period of variability introduced early in learning or by incorporating stochasticity into the visuomotor mapping. Our computational modeling analyses revealed that a hybrid model between model-free and model-based computations with different mixing weights for the training and generalization phases, best described participants’ data. Importantly, the differences in the model-based weights between our experimental groups, paralleled the behavioral findings during training and generalization. Taken together, our results suggest that training variability enables the flexible use of the visuomotor mapping, potentially by preventing the consolidation of habits due to the continuous demand to change responses.

                <p>by Jiaxin Jiang, Xiaona Meng, Yibo Wang, Ziqian Zhuang, Ting Du, Jing Yan</p>

Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes <i>CLEC4A</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>GPI</i>, <i>PMM2</i>, <i>PTPRD</i>, <i>IL7</i>, <i>ALDH3B1</i>, <i>AASS</i>, <i>AOC3</i>, <i>SEPINE1</i>, <i>PFKFB1</i>, <i>FTCD</i>, <i>TIMP1</i> and <i>GATM</i> were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <p>by Ilaria Granata, Lucia Maddalena, Mario Manzo, Mario Rosario Guarracino, Maurizio Giordano</p>

Machine learning-based approaches are particularly suitable for identifying essential genes as they allow the generation of predictive models trained on features from multi-source data. Gene essentiality is neither binary nor static but determined by the context. The databases for essential gene annotation do not permit the personalisation of the context, and their update can be slower than the publication of new experimental data. We propose HELP (Human Gene Essentiality Labelling & Prediction), a computational framework for labelling and predicting essential genes. Its double scope allows for identifying genes based on dependency or not on experimental data. The effectiveness of the labelling method was demonstrated by comparing it with other approaches in overlapping the reference sets of essential gene annotations, where HELP demonstrated the best compromise between false and true positive rates. The gene attributes, including multi-omics and network embedding features, lead to high-performance prediction of essential genes while confirming the existence of essentiality nuances.

                <p>by Cecile Le Sueur, Magnus Rattray, Mikhail Savitski</p>

Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is a proteome wide technology that enables unbiased detection of protein drug interactions as well as changes in post-translational state of proteins between different biological conditions. Statistical analysis of temperature range TPP (TPP-TR) datasets relies on comparing protein melting curves, describing the amount of non-denatured proteins as a function of temperature, between different conditions (e.g. presence or absence of a drug). However, state-of-the-art models are restricted to sigmoidal melting behaviours while unconventional melting curves, representing up to 50% of TPP-TR datasets, have recently been shown to carry important biological information. We present a novel statistical framework, based on hierarchical Gaussian process models and named GPMelt, to make TPP-TR datasets analysis unbiased with respect to the melting profiles of proteins. GPMelt scales to multiple conditions, and extension of the model to deeper hierarchies (i.e. with additional sub-levels) allows to deal with complex TPP-TR protocols. Collectively, our statistical framework extends the analysis of TPP-TR datasets for both protein and peptide level melting curves, offering access to thousands of previously excluded melting curves and thus substantially increasing the coverage and the ability of TPP to uncover new biology.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002821">Structure of the Nmd4-Upf1 complex supports conservation of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway between yeast and humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Irène Barbarin-Bocahu, Nathalie Ulryck, Amandine Rigobert, Nadia Ruiz Gutierrez, Laurence Decourty, Mouna Raji, Bhumika Garkhal, Hervé Le Hir, Cosmin Saveanu, Marc Graille</p>

The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway clears eukaryotic cells of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) or normal stop codons located in specific contexts. It therefore plays an important role in gene expression regulation. The precise molecular mechanism of the NMD pathway has long been considered to differ substantially from yeast to metazoa, despite the involvement of universally conserved factors such as the central ATP-dependent RNA-helicase Upf1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the yeast Upf1 bound to its recently identified but yet uncharacterized partner Nmd4, show that Nmd4 stimulates Upf1 ATPase activity and that this interaction contributes to the elimination of NMD substrates. We also demonstrate that a region of Nmd4 critical for the interaction with Upf1 in yeast is conserved in the metazoan SMG6 protein, another major NMD factor. We show that this conserved region is involved in the interaction of SMG6 with UPF1 and that mutations in this region affect the levels of endogenous human NMD substrates. Our results support the universal conservation of the NMD mechanism in eukaryotes.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Background The continuing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on healthcare systems all around the globe. There is no exception in the demographics of elective surgery also. Like any other medical professionals, surgeons and post-graduates are redirected to the management of patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgeries, surgeon skills, and post-graduate training. Methods This prospective study was done among 320 participants through a 15-question online cross-sectional survey sent primarily to surgeons practicing in six states of India that were most affected by the pandemic according to recent statistics and also to surgeons in other states via email or other online messaging services carried out from June 2021 to July 2021. Results 320 surgeons participated from various states in India. Overall, 59.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a reduction in bed availability, 70.4% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of oxygen, 78.8% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of PPE kits, 60.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a delay in procurement of surgical implants and 64% of participants also agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the post-graduate teaching program. Conclusions All these factors showed significant p-values with statistical significance, thereby indicating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and healthcare delivery. The pandemic also had a significant impact on post-graduate training.

                The 25th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2024, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2024) was part of the 2024 conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2024). Launched in 2000 and held yearly since, BOSC is the premier meeting covering open-source bioinformatics and open science. ISMB 2024 was held in Montréal, Canada, with an online participation option. A total of nearly 2000 people attended; about 200 people participated in BOSC sessions. Over the course of two days, BOSC covered a wide range of topics in open science and open source bioinformatics, including Data Analysis, Open Data, Visualization, Developer Tools and Libraries, Standards and Frameworks for Open Science, and Open AI/ML. Mélanie Courtot delivered an impactful first keynote with a perspective on how “The Data Shows We Need Better Data”. The second keynote speaker, Andrew Su, discussed “Open Data, Knowledge Graphs, and Large Language Models.” BOSC ended with a panel, “Open Source AI/ML: A Game Changer for Bioinformatics?,” in which Lawrence Hunter and Thomas Hervé Mboa Nkoudou joined BOSC’s keynote speakers as panelists. Immediately following BOSC, the CollaborationFest was held at Montréal’s University of Québec campus. First launched in 2010, CoFest is a collaborative work event held yearly around BOSC. This year’s CoFest included 42 participants who worked together on 10 projects.

                The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Delineating immune memory typically requires longitudinal serological studies that track antibody prevalence in the same cohort for an extended time. However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York’s mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.

                The search for neural markers of depression remains challenging. Despite progress, neuroimaging results have generally not yielded actionable findings that could transform how we understand and treat this disorder. However, in a recent study, Lynch and colleagues identified enlargement of the frontrostriatal salience network as a reproducible, trait-like marker of depression.

                The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have captured the world’s attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence – for example, all the words in a sentence – into a long ‘encoding vector’ that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, ‘self-attention’ applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas, or multiple regions on the whole-brain scale, could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable a temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle as that used in transformers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90633">Lost in translation: Inconvenient truths on the utility of mouse models in Alzheimer’s disease research</a></h4>

              
                The recent, controversial approval of antibody-based treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is fueling a heated debate on the molecular determinants of this condition. The discussion should also incorporate a critical revision of the limitations of preclinical mouse models in advancing our understanding of AD. We critically discuss the limitations of animal models, stressing the need for careful consideration of how experiments are designed and results interpreted. We identify the shortcomings of AD models to recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. We dissect these issues at the quantitative, qualitative, temporal, and context-dependent levels. We argue that these models are based on the oversimplistic assumptions proposed by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) of AD and fail to account for the multifactorial nature of the condition. By shedding light on the constraints of current experimental tools, this review aims to foster the development and implementation of more clinically relevant tools. While we do not rule out a role for preclinical models, we call for alternative approaches to be explored and, most importantly, for a re-evaluation of the ACH.

                We propose the Self Returning Excluded Volume (SR-EV) model for the structure of chromatin based on stochastic rules and physical interactions. The SR-EV <i>rules of return</i> generate conformationally defined domains observed by single-cell imaging techniques. From nucleosome to chromosome scales, the model captures the overall chromatin organization as a corrugated system, with dense and dilute regions alternating in a manner that resembles the mixing of two disordered bi-continuous phases. This particular organizational topology is a consequence of the multiplicity of interactions and processes occurring in the nuclei, and mimicked by the proposed return rules. Single configuration properties and ensemble averages show a robust agreement between theoretical and experimental results including chromatin volume concentration, contact probability, packing domain identification and size characterization, and packing scaling behavior. Model and experimental results suggest that there is an inherent chromatin organization regardless of the cell character and resistant to an external forcing such as RAD21 degradation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95867">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to study inflammation-induced aberrant calcium transient</a></h4>

              
                Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is commonly found in persons living with HIV (PLWH) even when antiretroviral therapy suppresses HIV viremia. However, studying this condition has been challenging because an appropriate animal model is not available. In this article, we studied calcium transient in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in culture to simulate the cardiomyocyte relaxation defect noted in PLWH and HFpEF and assess whether various drugs have an effect. We show that treatment of hiPSC-CMs with inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon-γ or TNF-α) impairs their Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum and that SGLT2 inhibitors, clinically proven as effective for HFpEF, reverse this effect. Additionally, treatment with mitochondrial antioxidants (like mito-Tempo) and certain antiretrovirals resulted in the reversal of the effects of these cytokines on calcium transient. Finally, incubation of hiPSC-CMs with serum from HIV patients with and without diastolic dysfunction did not alter their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-decay time, indicating that the exposure to the serum of these patients is not sufficient to induce the decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in vitro. Together, our results indicate that hiPSC-CMs can be used as a model to study molecular mechanisms of inflammation-mediated abnormal cardiomyocyte relaxation and screen for potential new interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98739">Reproducible, data-driven characterization of sleep based on brain dynamics and transitions from whole-night fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the function of sleep requires studying the dynamics of brain activity across whole-night sleep and their transitions. However, current gold standard polysomnography (PSG) has limited spatial resolution to track brain activity. Additionally, previous fMRI studies were too short to capture full sleep stages and their cycling. To study whole-brain dynamics and transitions across whole-night sleep, we used an unsupervised learning approach, the Hidden Markov model (HMM), on two-night, 16 hr fMRI recordings of 12 non-sleep-deprived participants who reached all PSG-based sleep stages. This method identified 21 recurring brain states and their transition probabilities, beyond PSG-defined sleep stages. The HMM trained on one night accurately predicted the other, demonstrating unprecedented reproducibility. We also found functionally relevant subdivisions within rapid eye movement (REM) and within non-REM 2 stages. This study provides new insights into brain dynamics and transitions during sleep, aiding our understanding of sleep disorders that impact sleep transitions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97444">High-frequency terahertz stimulation alleviates neuropathic pain by inhibiting the pyramidal neuron activity in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system and is characterized by abnormal hypersensitivity to stimuli and nociceptive responses to non-noxious stimuli, affecting approximately 7–10% of the general population. However, current first-line drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids have limitations, including dose-limiting side effects, dependence, and tolerability issues. Therefore, developing new interventions for the management of NP is urgent. In this study, we discovered that the high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) at approximately 36 THz effectively alleviates NP symptoms in mice with spared nerve injury. Computational simulation suggests that the frequency resonates with the carbonyl group in the filter region of Kv1.2 channels, facilitating the translocation of potassium ions. In vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that HFTS reduces the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex likely through enhancing the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and also the leak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This research presents a novel optical intervention strategy with terahertz waves for the treatment of NP and holds promising applications in other nervous system diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96854">Task-dependent coarticulation of movement sequences</a></h4>

              
                Combining individual actions into sequences is a hallmark of everyday activities. Classical theories propose that the motor system forms a single specification of the sequence as a whole, leading to the coarticulation of the different elements. In contrast, recent neural recordings challenge this idea and suggest independent execution of each element specified separately. Here, we show that separate or coarticulated sequences can result from the same task-dependent controller, without implying different representations in the brain. Simulations show that planning for multiple reaches simultaneously allows separate or coarticulated sequences depending on instructions about intermediate goals. Human experiments in a two-reach sequence task validated this model. Furthermore, in co-articulated sequences, the second goal influenced long-latency stretch responses to external loads applied during the first reach, demonstrating the involvement of the sensorimotor network supporting fast feedback control. Overall, our study establishes a computational framework for sequence production that highlights the importance of feedback control in this essential motor skill.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96343">Merging multi-omics with proteome integral solubility alteration unveils antibiotic mode of action</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance is responsible for an alarming number of deaths, estimated at 5 million per year. To combat priority pathogens, like <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, the development of novel therapies is of utmost importance. Understanding the molecular alterations induced by medications is critical for the design of multi-targeting treatments capable of eradicating the infection and mitigating its pathogenicity. However, the application of bulk omics approaches for unraveling drug molecular mechanisms of action is limited by their inability to discriminate between target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a multi-omics method to overcome the existing limitation. For the first time, the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay is utilized in bacteria in the PISA-Express format to link proteome solubility with different and potentially immediate responses to drug treatment, enabling us the resolution to understand target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a comprehensive method for understanding drug mechanisms and optimizing the development of multi-targeting antimicrobial therapies.

">Entorhinal grid-like codes for visual space during memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Eye movements, such as saccades, allow us to gather information about the environment and, in this way, can shape memory. In non-human primates, saccades are associated with the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. Grid cells are essential for spatial navigation, but whether saccade-based grid-like signals play a role in human memory formation is currently unclear. Here, human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and continuous eye gaze monitoring while studying scene images. Recognition memory was probed immediately thereafter. Results revealed saccade-based grid-like codes in the left entorhinal cortex while participants studied the scene images, a finding that was replicated with an independent data set reported here. The grid-related effects were time-locked to activation increases in the frontal eye fields. Most importantly, saccade-based grid-like codes were associated with recognition memory, such that grid-like codes were lower the better participants performed in subsequently recognizing the scene images. Collectively, our findings suggest an entorhinal map of visual space that is timed with neural activity in oculomotor regions, supporting memory formation.

">Predictive influences on memory encoding: investigating oscillations and the N400 event-related potential component</a></h4>

              
                To effectively function in an ever-changing environment, the brain is proposed to make predictions about upcoming information. However, the association between prediction and memory formation and the role of between-subject neural variability in this relationship is unclear. To shed light on the relationship between prediction and memory, the present study reanalysed data from Jano and colleagues (2023). In the original experiment, participants were exposed to naturalistic images in predictable and unpredictable four-item sequences, after which their memory was tested using an old/new paradigm. In the present analysis (N = 46), N400 amplitude and oscillatory power during learning was measured to gauge processes related to prediction error and memory encoding, respectively. This activity was compared with subsequent memory outcomes and individual alpha frequency (IAF) calculated at rest. Linear mixed-effects regressions revealed an alpha power subsequent memory effect that was not related to the amplitude of the N400, suggesting that memory encoding may occur independently of the level of prediction error. Notably, IAF influenced the relationship between theta power, N400 amplitude and subsequent memory, implying that the electrophysiological conditions for successful memory formation differ between individuals. Consequently, the extent to which prediction errors (presumably captured via the N400) drive memory encoding could depend on inter-individual variability in intrinsic neural activity. These findings emphasise the flexible nature of memory, whilst having potential implications for prediction error-driven accounts of learning.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Meditation induces changes in the nervous system, which presumably underpin positive psychological and physiological effects. Such neural changes include alterations in the arousal fluctuation, as well as in infraslow brain activity (ISA, &amp;amp;lt;0.1 Hz). Furthermore, it is known that fluctuations of arousal over time correlate with the oscillatory phase of ISA. However, whether this arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlation changes after meditation practices remains unanswered.; Methods: The present study aims to address this question by analyzing a publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset recorded during meditation sessions in the groups of experienced meditators and novices. The arousal fluctuation is measured by galvanic skin responses (GSR), and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations are measured by phase synchronization between GSR and EEG ISAs.; Results: While both groups exhibit arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations, experienced meditators display higher correlations than novices. These increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations in experienced meditators manifest more clearly when oscillatory phase differences between GSR and EEG ISAs are either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians. As such, we further investigate the characteristics of these phase differences with respect to spatial distribution over the brain. We found that brain regions with the phase difference of either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians form distinct spatial clusters, and that these clusters are spatially correlated with functional organization estimated by the principal gradient, based on functional connectivity.; Conclusions: Since increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations reflect enhanced global organization of the central and autonomic nervous systems, our findings imply that the positive effects of meditation might be mediated by enhanced global organization of the nervous system.</p>

	<p>Introduction: This study investigates how traumatic injuries alter joint movements in the ankle and foot. We used a brain injury model in rats, focusing on the hippocampus between the CA1 and dentate gyrus. Materials and Methods: We assessed the dissimilarity factor (DF) and vertical displacement (VD) of the ankle and metatarsus joints before and after the hippocampal lesion. We analyzed joint movements in rats after the injury or in rats treated with resveratrol, exercise, or a combination of both. Results: Resveratrol facilitated the recovery of DF in both legs, showing improvements in the ankle and metatarsus joints on the third and seventh days post-injury. The hippocampal lesion affected VD in both legs, observed on the third or seventh day after the injury. Both exercise and resveratrol partially recovered VD in the ankle and metatarsus joints on these days. These effects may be linked to increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusions: The study highlights the benefits of resveratrol and exercise in motor recovery following brain injury, suggesting their potential to enhance the quality of life for patients with neurological disorders affecting motor function and locomotion. These findings also suggest that resveratrol could offer a promising or complementary alternative in managing chronic pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic conditions, thus improving overall patient management.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research suggests that metalinguistic and cognitive/attentional-control processes are key variables in literacy development in young learners. Interactions between these variables are complex, and this complexity is increased in multilingual learners. With data on the interplay between metalinguistic and cognitive awareness, literacy, and multilingualism being scarce, it is far from clear how these variables interact and how they impact the individual child. This article sets out to shine some light on the interconnectedness and interactions between metalinguistic awareness, cognitive/executive functions, and (multilingual) literacy. Conclusions: We argue that the three dimensions are strongly correlated and that this correlation comes with important implications for language learning, language processing, and language development. However, the exact nature of these correlations is yet to be established.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease with progressive neurodegeneration, affecting both the cortical and the spinal component of the motor neuron circuitry in patients. The cellular and molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability is beginning to emerge. Yet, there are no effective cures for ALS, which affects more than 200,000 people worldwide each year. Recent studies highlight the importance of the glymphatic system and its proper function for the clearance of the cerebral spinal fluid, which is achieved mostly during the sleep period. Therefore, a potential link between problems with sleep and neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. This paper discusses the present understanding of this potential correlation.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal infection is a major risk factor for diffuse white matter injury (dWMI), which remains the most common form of neurological disability among very preterm infants. The disease primarily targets oligodendrocytes (OL) lineage cells in the white matter but also involves injury and/or dysmaturation of neurons of the gray matter. This study aimed to investigate whether neuroinflammation preferentially affects the cellular compositions of the white matter or gray matter. Method: Neuroinflammation was initiated by intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat pups at postnatal (P) day 5, and neurobiological and behavioral outcomes were assessed between P6 and P21. Results: LPS challenge rapidly activates microglia and astrocytes, which is associated with the inhibition of OL and neuron differentiation leading to myelination deficits. Specifically, neuroinflammation reduces the immature OLs but not progenitors and causes acute axonal injury (&amp;amp;beta;-amyloid precursor protein immunopositivity) and impaired dendritic maturation (reduced MAP2+ neural fiber density) in the cortical area at P7. Neuroinflammation also reduces the expression of doublecortin in the hippocampus, suggesting compromise in neurogenesis. Utilizing a battery of behavioral assessments, we found that LPS-exposed animals exhibited deficits in sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains. Conclusion: Our overall results indicate that neuroinflammation alone in the early postnatal period can produce cardinal neuropathological features of dWMI.</p>

	<p>Background: Hemodynamics during the growth process of cerebral aneurysms are incompletely understood. We developed a novel fluid&amp;amp;ndash;structure interaction analysis method for the identification of relevant scenarios of aneurysm onset. Method: This method integrates both fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, as well as their mutual interaction, for a comprehensive analysis. Patients with a single unruptured cerebral aneurysm were included. Results: Overall, three scenarios were identified. In scenario A, wall shear stress (WSS) was low, and the oscillatory shear index (OSI) was high in large areas within the region of aneurysm onset (RAO). In scenario B, the quantities indicated a reversed behavior, where WSS was high and OSI was low. In the last scenario C, a behavior in-between was found, with scenarios A and B coexisting simultaneously in the RAO. Structural mechanics demonstrated a similar but independent trend. Further, we analyzed the change in hemodynamics between the onset and a fully developed aneurysm. While scenarios A and C remained unchanged during aneurysm growth, 47% of aneurysms in scenario B changed into scenario A and 20% into scenario C. Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings suggest that WSS and the OSI are reciprocally regulated, and both low and high WSS/OSI conditions can lead to aneurysm onset.</p>

	<p>Background: Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are reported in more than 80% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), most commonly an overactive bladder (OAB). The relationship between brain white matter (WM) changes in MS and OAB symptoms is poorly understood. Objectives: We aim to evaluate (i) microstructural WM differences across MS patients (pwMS) with OAB symptoms, patients without LUT symptoms, and healthy subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and (ii) associations between clinical OAB symptom scores and DTI indices. Methods: Twenty-nine female pwMS [mean age (SD) 43.3 years (9.4)], including seventeen with OAB [mean age (SD) 46.1 years (8.6)] and nine without LUT symptoms [mean age (SD) 37.5 years (8.9)], and fourteen healthy controls (HCs) [mean age (SD) 48.5 years (20)] were scanned in a 3T MRI with a DTI protocol. Additionally, clinical scans were performed for WM lesion segmentation. Group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. The Urinary Symptom Profile questionnaire assessed OAB severity. Results: A statistically significant reduction in FA (p = 0.004) was identified in microstructural WM in pwMS, compared with HCs. An inverse correlation was found between FA in frontal and parietal WM lobes and OAB scores (p = 0.021) in pwMS. Areas of lower FA, although this did not reach statistical significance, were found in both frontal lobes and the rest of the non-dominant hemisphere in pwMS with OAB compared with pwMS without LUT symptoms (p = 0.072). Conclusions: This study identified that lesions affecting different WM tracts in MS can result in OAB symptoms and demonstrated the role of the WM in the neural control of LUT functions. By using DTI, the association between OAB symptom severity and WM changes were identified, adding knowledge to the current LUT working model. As MS is predominantly a WM disease, these findings suggest that regional WM involvement, including of the anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior frontal-occipital fasciculus and a non-dominant prevalence in WM, can result in OAB symptoms. OAB symptoms in MS correlate with anisotropy changes in different white matter tracts as demonstrated by DTI. Structural impairment in WM tracts plays an important role in LUT symptoms in MS.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by structural changes in the brain, including hippocampal atrophy, cortical thinning, amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Due to the aging of the global population, the burden of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is expected to increase, making the exploration of non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, an urgent priority. Results: There is emerging evidence that regular physical exercise may mitigate the structural and functional declines associated with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis research is a promising area for further investigation. This system involves bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. According to recent studies, the gut microbiome may influence brain health through modulating neuroinflammation, producing neuroactive compounds, and altering metabolic processes. Exercise has been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiome, potentially impacting brain structure and function. In this review, we aim to synthesize current research on the relationship between physical exercise, structural brain changes in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Conclusions: In this study, we will investigate whether changes in the gut microbiome induced by physical exercise can mediate its neuroprotective effects, offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and microbiome research, this review will highlight potential mechanisms. It will also identify key gaps in the literature. This will pave the way for future research directions.</p>

	<p>Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation&amp;amp;mdash;a factor previously linked to SI/SB development&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v2?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1097/v1?src=rss">A high-throughput gene expression analysis software tool for developmental time series and gene signature analysis of human cardiomyocyte differentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Publicly available high-throughput gene expression data enable the investigation of biological processes by the scientific community. Although several bioinformatics tools offer methodologies for basic differential gene expression analysis, difficulties arise in the analysis of multiple sample groups comprising a developmental time series, especially when the identification and classification of unique gene expression patterns is the primary goal of the study. Data analysis using these tools requires programming experience, which limits the accessibility of these tools to the broader community. To streamline developmental time-series investigations, we created the Developmental Gene Expression Analysis (devGEA) tool. This environment can be implemented locally or via web browsers to expedite differential gene expression analysis. This tool provides gene signature determination methods that can classify differentially expressed genes based on their correlation with gene expression patterns. devGEA was used to characterize cardiac development gene expression signatures from high-throughput RNA-seq datasets profiling small-molecule directed cardiomyocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs). After pre-processing, discrete gene expression criteria-based expected changes were used to classify the genes into developmental signatures. Several cardiomyocyte differentiation markers and candidate cardiac genes representing different developmental signatures were experimentally validated using the GIBCOTM hiPSC line. This method was then compared to a gene signature correlation approach that classified expressed genes based on their degree of similarity with key cardiac developmental signatures representing the stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Therefore, devGEA provides a robust workflow for investigator-driven analysis of developmental time series, allowing for the identification of differentially expressed genes and gene signatures for extensive experimental investigation. We also introduced a method for classifying genes by their correlation with genes or developmental patterns of interest. Our correlation-based method takes advantage of a priori knowledge of an experiment and is conceptually simpler than unsupervised clustering approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-789/v2?src=rss">Occurrence of pathogenic yeast species in artisanal cheeses from Boyacá, Colombia, including fluconazole resistant isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1096/v1?src=rss">Fiscal sustainability analysis in selected SADC region countries with emphasis on South Africa: dynamic modeling, nonlinear causality, and machine learning approaches [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aims to evaluate the changes in the sustainability of fiscal policies in South Africa and selected Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries by employing the Kalman filter and Markov switching model and further overcome the limitations of previous studies by considering the impact of previously neglected variables. Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes regression analysis, the Kalman filter, and the Markov switching model. By analysing GDP data for SADC countries, regime shifts are estimated, and fiscal sustainability is evaluated. To enhance numerical adaptation, a random walk state space model is incorporated into the conventional Kalman filter. Originality and value This study significantly contributes to academia and the field of economics in South Africa by addressing previous research limitations on fiscal policy sustainability. It incorporates previously omitted variables and employs advanced estimation techniques, such as the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model, to provide a comprehensive understanding of fiscal sustainability in South Africa and selected SADC countries. The findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers and government authorities, including the necessity of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt, adherence to specified borrowing ratios, and reforms to increase savings and overall fiscal sustainability in the SADC region. Findings The random walk-based Kalman filter exhibits superior numerical adaptation compared to the conventional approach. An analysis of normalized financial impacts reveals significant variations in fiscal sustainability among SADC countries and different GDP categories. Countries with higher GDPs generally exhibit greater financial sustainability, while those with lower GDPs face more challenges in this regard. Conclusion Advanced estimation techniques like the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model offer critical insights into fiscal sustainability in South Africa and the broader SADC region. They further provide a more accurate and comprehensive analysis, revealing significant variations in fiscal stability across different GDP categories.

                <p>by Ylva Katarina Wedmark, Jon Olav Vik, Ove Øyås</p>

The metabolic network of an organism can be analyzed as a constraint-based model. This analysis can be biased, optimizing an objective such as growth rate, or unbiased, aiming to describe the full feasible space of metabolic fluxes through pathway analysis or random flux sampling. In particular, pathway analysis can decompose the flux space into fundamental and formally defined metabolic pathways. Unbiased methods scale poorly with network size due to combinatorial explosion, but a promising approach to improve scalability is to focus on metabolic subnetworks, e.g., cells’ metabolite exchanges with each other and the environment, rather than the full metabolic networks. Here, we applied pathway enumeration and flux sampling to metabolite exchanges in microbial species and a microbial community, using models ranging from central carbon metabolism to genome-scale and focusing on pathway definitions that allow direct targeting of subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges (elementary conversion modes, elementary flux patterns, and minimal pathways). Enumerating growth-supporting metabolite exchanges, we found that metabolite exchanges from different pathway definitions were related through a hierarchy, and we show that this hierarchical relationship between pathways holds for metabolic networks and subnetworks more generally. Metabolite exchange frequencies, defined as the fraction of pathways in which each metabolite was exchanged, were similar across pathway definitions, with a few specific exchanges explaining large differences in pathway counts. This indicates that biological interpretation of predicted metabolite exchanges is robust to the choice of pathway definition, and it suggests strategies for more scalable pathway analysis. Our results also signal wider biological implications, facilitating detailed and interpretable analysis of metabolite exchanges and other subnetworks in fields such as metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

                <p>by Elena Miu, Luke Rendell, Sam Bowles, Rob Boyd, Daniel Cownden, Magnus Enquist, Kimmo Eriksson, Marcus W. Feldman, Timothy Lillicrap, Richard McElreath, Stuart Murray, James Ounsley, Kevin N. Lala</p>

Social learning is common in nature, yet cumulative culture (where knowledge and technology increase in complexity and diversity over time) appears restricted to humans. To understand why, we organized a computer tournament in which programmed entries specified when to learn new knowledge and when to refine (i.e. improve) existing knowledge. The tournament revealed a ‘refinement paradox’: refined behavior afforded higher payoffs as individuals converged on a small number of successful behavioral variants, but refining did not generally pay. Paradoxically, entries that refined only in certain conditions did best during behavioral improvement, while simple copying entries thrived when refinement levels were high. Cumulative cultural evolution may be rare in part because sophisticated strategies for improving knowledge and technology are initially advantageous, yet complex culture, once achieved, favors conformity, blind imitation and hyper-credulity.

                <p>by Carlos Albors, Jordi Mill, Andy L. Olivares, Xavier Iriart, Hubert Cochet, Oscar Camara</p>

Left atrial appendage occlusion devices (LAAO) are a feasible alternative for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients at high risk of thromboembolic stroke and contraindication to antithrombotic therapies. However, optimal LAAO device configurations (i.e., size, type, location) remain unstandardized due to the large anatomical variability of the left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology, leading to a 4-6% incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT). In-silico simulations have the potential to assess DRT risk and identify the key factors, such as suboptimal device positioning. This work presents fluid simulation results computed on 20 patient-specific left atrial geometries, analysing different commercially available LAAO occluders, including plug-type and pacifier-type devices. In addition, we explored two distinct device positions: 1) the real post-LAAO intervention configuration derived from follow-up imaging; and 2) one covering the pulmonary ridge if it was not achieved during the implantation (13 out of 20). In total, 33 different configurations were analysed. In-silico indices indicating high risk of DRT (e.g., low blood flow velocities and flow complexity around the device) were combined with particle deposition analysis based on a discrete phase model. The obtained results revealed that covering the pulmonary ridge with the LAAO device may be one of the key factors to prevent DRT, resulting in higher velocities and reduced flow recirculations (e.g., mean velocities of 0.183 ± 0.12 m/s and 0.236 ± 0.16 m/s for uncovered versus covered positions in DRT patients). Moreover, disk-based devices exhibited enhanced adaptability to various LAA morphologies and, generally, demonstrated a lower risk of abnormal events after LAAO implantation.

Understanding perturbations in circulating lipid levels that often occur years or decades before clinical symptoms may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide novel intervention opportunities. Here, we assessed if polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits could detect lipid dysfunctions related to the traits and provide new biological insights. We constructed genome-wide PGSs (approximately 1 million genetic variants) for 50 complex traits in 7,169 Finnish individuals with routine clinical lipid profiles and lipidomics measurements (179 lipid species). We identified 678 associations (<i>P</i> < 9.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) involving 26 traits and 142 lipids. Most of these associations were also validated with the actual phenotype measurements where available (89.5% of 181 associations where the trait was available), suggesting that these associations represent early signs of physiological changes of the traits. We detected many known relationships (e.g., PGS for body mass index (BMI) and lysophospholipids, PGS for type 2 diabetes and triacyglycerols) and those that suggested potential target for prevention strategies (e.g., PGS for venous thromboembolism and arachidonic acid). We also found association of PGS for favorable adiposity with increased sphingomyelins levels, suggesting a probable role of sphingomyelins in increased risk for certain disease, e.g., venous thromboembolism as reported previously, in favorable adiposity despite its favorable metabolic effect. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lipidomic alterations in genetic predisposition for a wide range of complex traits. The study also demonstrates potential of PGSs for complex traits to capture early, presymptomatic lipid alterations, highlighting its utility in understanding disease mechanisms and early disease detection.

                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Nico Niebuhr, Gregory Butler, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Transport proteins play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and are central to many aspects of molecular biology and medicine. Determining the function of transport proteins experimentally is challenging, as they become unstable when isolated from cell membranes. Machine learning-based predictions could provide an efficient alternative. However, existing methods are limited to predicting a small number of specific substrates or broad transporter classes. These limitations stem partly from using small data sets for model training and a choice of input features that lack sufficient information about the prediction problem. Here, we present SPOT, the first general machine learning model that can successfully predict specific substrates for arbitrary transport proteins, achieving an accuracy above 92% on independent and diverse test data covering widely different transporters and a broad range of metabolites. SPOT uses Transformer Networks to represent transporters and substrates numerically. To overcome the problem of missing negative data for training, it augments a large data set of known transporter-substrate pairs with carefully sampled random molecules as non-substrates. SPOT not only predicts specific transporter-substrate pairs, but also outperforms previously published models designed to predict broad substrate classes for individual transport proteins. We provide a web server and Python function that allows users to explore the substrate scope of arbitrary transporters.

                <p>by Jobran Chebib, Anika Jonas, Eugenio López-Cortegano, Sven Künzel, Diethard Tautz, Peter D. Keightley</p>

Each generation, spontaneous mutations introduce heritable changes that tend to reduce fitness in populations of highly adapted living organisms. This erosion of fitness is countered by natural selection, which keeps deleterious mutations at low frequencies and ultimately removes most of them from the population. The classical way of studying the impact of spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, where lines of small effective population size are bred for many generations in conditions where natural selection is largely removed. Such experiments in microbes, invertebrates, and plants have generally demonstrated that fitness decays as a result of MA. However, the phenotypic consequences of MA in vertebrates are largely unknown, because no replicated MA experiment has previously been carried out. This gap in our knowledge is relevant for human populations, where societal changes have reduced the strength of natural selection, potentially allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate. Here, we study the impact of spontaneous MA on the mean and genetic variation for quantitative and fitness-related traits in the house mouse using the MA experimental design, with a cryopreserved control to account for environmental influences. We show that variation for morphological and life history traits accumulates at a sufficiently high rate to maintain genetic variation and selection response. Weight and tail length measures decrease significantly between 0.04% and 0.3% per generation with narrow confidence intervals. Fitness proxy measures (litter size and surviving offspring) decrease on average by about 0.2% per generation, but with confidence intervals overlapping zero. When extrapolated to humans, our results imply that the rate of fitness loss should not be of concern in the foreseeable future.

[version 2; peer review: 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Restorative dental materials are defined as substances that are used to repair, replace, or enhance a patient’s teeth. Various materials used in paediatric dentistry are zinc oxide eugenol, glass ionomer cement, resin composite, calcium hydroxide, silver amalgam, giomers etc. GIC is a biocompatible material having a low thermal expansion coefficient and fluoride release property. There are still a few drawbacks of GICdue of their poor mechanical properties therefore addition of Silver Nanoparticles demonstrated improved mechanical and bactericidal capabilities. There hasn’t been much study on the quality of the bond contact between silver nanoparticles and dentin, as well as the color’s durability. Aim: To evaluate and compare the mechanical properties and bond strength of Glass ionomer cement reinforced with three different concentrations of silver nanoparticle as against conventional glass ionomer cement in primary Teeth. Materials and Method: Silver nanoparticles will be prepared using three chemicals namely, silver nitrate, sodium citrate and tannic acid. Traditional GIC (GC Fuji II, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) will be purchased. Three different concentrations of silver nanoparticles will be prepared i.e., 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6%. The GIC specimens will then be divided into 4 groups: GIC without silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),0.2%,0.4% and 0.6% AgNPs. Mechanical properties will be checked such as compressive, tensile, and bond strength using Universal Testing Machine. Expected Results: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles is expected to have better mechanical strength, less microleakage and wear resistance, greater fracture resistance and adhesive bond strength. Conclusion: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles will be expected to have better mechanical and physical properties than conventional Type II GICs and is expected to be a promising material for restoration in primary teeth.

                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background The primary objective worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had been controlling disease transmission. However, lockdown measures used to mitigate transmission affected human behavior and altered lifestyles, with a likely impact on chronic non-communicable diseases. More than a year into the pandemic, substantial peer-reviewed literature emerged on altered lifestyles following the varying lockdown measures imposed globally to control the virus spread. We explored the impact of lockdown measures on six lifestyle factors, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social connectedness, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed and the World Health Organization’s global literature database on COVID-19 and retrieved 649 relevant articles for the narrative review. A critical interpretative synthesis of the articles was performed. Results Most of the articles included in the review identified the negative effect of lockdown measures on each of the lifestyle factors in many parts of the world. Encouraging lifestyle trends were also highlighted in a few articles. Such trends can positively influence the outcome of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Conclusions The lockdown associated with COVID-19 has largely had a negative impact on the lifestyles of individuals and communities across many countries and cultures. However, some individuals and communities also initiated positive lifestyle-related behavioral changes. If the knowledge generated by studying the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on the six lifestyle factors is further consolidated, it could improve chronic disease outcomes. This will help better understand lifestyle behaviors amidst crises and assist in redesigning extreme public health measures such as lockdowns.. It is up to governments, communities, and healthcare/academic entities to derive benefit from lessons learned from the pandemic, with the ultimate objective of better educating and promoting healthy lifestyles among communities.

                Behçet’s disease (BD) is rare in children. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old male child with a history of left superficial femoral vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, admitted for multiple thrombosis located in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and ventricle associated with multiple pulmonary artery aneurisms and fissurations concomitant to oral aphthosis, which was suggestive of BD. Despite corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, the child had a massive hemoptysis resulting in his death. The association between intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary aneurism and venous thrombosis should raise suspicion of angio-Behçet, which could be lethal.

                Background The escalating impact of climate change underscores the critical need for advanced and sustainable climate forecasting techniques. This review examines the current state and future prospects of leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for climate forecasting, focusing on enhancing accuracy and identifying complex patterns in large datasets. Methods A systematic bibliometric methodology was employed, analyzing peer-reviewed literature from the past two decades. The study screened 455 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases using specific keywords related to AI and weather forecasting. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, 218 articles were selected for detailed analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using RStudio software to examine publication trends, co-word co-occurrence, and thematic evolution. Results The findings indicate significant growth in AI applications for climate forecasting, particularly from 2014 to 2023. AI techniques such as machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep learning have shown promise in improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and early warning systems. The thematic analysis identified key themes like numerical weather prediction, feature selection, and neural networks as fundamental areas of research. Additionally, AI-based early warning systems for extreme weather events were highlighted as a crucial application. Below Figure 1. shows the graphical abstract of research Conclusions AI has the potential to significantly enhance climate forecasting by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying complex patterns. Future research should focus on developing universal AI models, increasing model accuracy with explainable AI techniques, and integrating region-specific forecasts to aid decision-making in various sectors. Addressing ethical concerns and ensuring sustainable AI applications are essential for the responsible deployment of AI in climate forecasting.

                Background This study examines Muhammad Shahrur’s theory of limits and women’s issues. This theory adjusts the muhkamat verses to remain relevant to sociocultural conditions while remining within the jurisdiction of Allah SWT. Shahrur’s approach conveyed women as different from traditional ulemas and controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to describe Shahrur’s theory and interpretation of women’s issues. Methods This was an exploratory bibliographic study using descriptive-hermeneutic analysis. Two of Shahrur’s books were selected and five chapters from Al-Kitāb wa Al-Qur’ān, Qirā’ah Mu’āshirah and five chapters from Nahw Ushūl al-Jadīdah Li al-Fiqh al-Islāmy; Fiqh al-Mar’ah . Results Shahrur’s interpretations on women’s issues are: a) relationships between teenagers of the opposite sex without marriage or living together are “halal” if they follow their will without a contract and are accompanied by syecih, or permission; b) the maximum limit of the hijab is to cover the entire body except the face and palms. In contrast, the minimum limit covers the juyūb, including cleavage under the armpits, body parts, genitals, and buttocks. Apart from these, it does not include intimate parts and adapts to the community. c) Women’s intimate parts are shown only to the seven groups: brothers, fathers, children of a sibling, parents of one’s wives, and their children; d) Polygamy has both an upper limit and a lower limit. Shahrur allows polygamy under two conditions: widows with children whose husbands left them to protect them; polygamy has two limitations: a limit for quantity and a limit for quality; and e) the law of adultery has a lower and upper limit. Conclusion According to Shahrur, women’s issues are divided into four limits: sometimes they are at the upper limit and sometimes at the lower limit. Shahrur’s linguistic approach finally led him to draw the conclusion that the product of Islamic law is highly dependent on the sociocultural context.

                Background Haematological abnormalities following renal transplantation are frequently observed and have a significant effect on survival and graft outcomes. The pattern of haematological abnormalities varies globally. Few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of haematological abnormalities in post-transplant recipients in our center during the first year after post-renal transplant and the association of post-transplant anemia with graft function. Methods This single-center retrospective study was conducted on renal transplantation recipients between 2014 and 2019. The study included all patients who received kidney transplants from live/cadaveric donors and had follow-up data collected up to 12 months after the transplant. The outcome studied was the prevalence of haematological abnormalities and the association between post-transplant anemia (PTA) and graft function in post-transplant recipients. Results A total of 106 renal transplant recipients were included in the study. The prevalence of PTA was 98% in the first week, 75% at one month, 35% at three months, 32% at six months, and 27% at 12 months. The other cytopenia cases were leukopenia (43.4%), thrombocytopenia (33.2%), and pancytopenia (15.1%). Post-transplant erythrocytosis was observed in 17.9% of patients. 18 patients with severe PTA in the first week of transplant had significant allograft dysfunction (p=0.04). Patients with and without PTA had similar graft functions at six and 12 months (p=0.50). Conclusions Haematological abnormalities are common in renal transplant recipients. PTA is highly prevalent during the first week and improves over time. Other haematological abnormalities observed were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and post-transplant erythrocytosis. Leucopenia was primarily drug-induced, and thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia were frequently caused by infections in our cohort. Additionally, severe PTA was significantly associated with graft dysfunction in the first week post-transplant, whereas similar graft function was observed at 6 and 12 months post-transplant, irrespective of the presence or absence of PTA.

                Introduction: The COVID-19 virus has impacted people worldwide, causing significant changes in their lifestyles. Since the emergence of the epidemic, attempts have begun to prepare a vaccine that can eliminate the virus and restore balance to life in the entire world. Over the past two years, countries and specialized companies have competed to obtain a license from the World Health Organization for the vaccines that were discovered. After the appearance of vaccines in the health community, comparisons and fears of their side effects began, but people don’t get an answer to the question of which is the best vaccine. Methods: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, the New England Journal of Medicine, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were searched for literature on the COVID-19 vaccine and its side effects. we surveyed the literature on the COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects and the sorts of side effects observed after vaccination. Depending on data from the literature, we compared these vaccines in terms of side effects, then we analyzed the gaps and obstacles of previous studies and made proposals to process these gaps in future studies. Results: Overall, 17 studies were included in this scoping systematic review as they fulfilled the criteria specified, the majority of which were cross-sectional and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Most of the side effects were mild, self-limiting, and common. Thus, they usually resolve within 1–3 days after vaccination. Factors associated with higher side effects included advanced age, allergic conditions, those taking other medications (particularly immunosuppressive ones), those with a history of type II diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, COVID-19 infection, and female sex. Our meta‐analyses also found that mRNA vaccines looked to be more effective, while inactivated vaccinations had fewer side effects. Conclusion: This review shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe to administer and induces protection.
