                <p>For the first time an ecstatic aura has been evoked through the electrical stimulation of the dorsal anterior insula during pre-surgical invasive intracerebral monitoring in a patient who did not suffer from an ecstatic form of epilepsy. This case provides more evidence that the anterior insula is the major generator of such a mystical-type experience even in individuals with no underlying brain network changes related to a pre-existing ecstatic epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">DBS of thalamic centromedian nucleus for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (ESTEL trial)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for treatment of LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received three-months stimulation (blinded phase), then all received three-months stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a ≥ 50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory EEG at the end of blinded phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between November 2017–December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17–37 years;13 females) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single centre in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10; control, n = 9). 50% of the stimulation group achieved ≥50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (OR3.1; 95%CI 0.44–21.45; p = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had ≥50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR23.25; 95%CI 1.0–538.4; p = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (IQR 28–67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR 27–73%) for electrographic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after three-months of stimulation. 50% of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at study exit, providing supporting evidence of treatment effect.</p>

	<p>Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with different neurological conditions such as Guillain-Barr&amp;amp;eacute;, encephalitis and stroke. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited small-vessel disease characterized by recurrent ischemic stroke, cognitive decline, migraine and mood disturbances. One of the mechanisms involved in CADASIL pathogenesis is endothelial dysfunction, which causes an increased risk of recurrent strokes. Since COVID-19 infection is also associated with coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction, the risk of ischemic stroke might be even higher in this population. We describe the case of a CADASIL patient who developed an acute ischemic stroke after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In patients with diseases causing endothelial dysregulation, such as CADASIL, the hypercoagulability related to COVID-19 may contribute to the risk of stroke recurrence.</p>

	<p>Cancer-related treatments may lead to side effects that undermine a patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life (QOL). Although cognitive behavioral therapy plus coping management (CBTM) may appear to improve health-related QOL in cancer patients, limited documentation exists on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for patients with breast cancer (BC) during recovery. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of CBTM for sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and health among patients with BC. An experimental study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a CBTM intervention (experimental group = 36, control group = 34). The experimental group received a 12-week CBTM intervention focused on their identity, challenges, the replacement of dysfunctional beliefs, coping skills, relaxation, and rehabilitation exercises, while the control group received usual care. The follow-up evaluations were performed immediately after the intervention (T1), and at one (T2) and three months (T3). The generalized estimating equation (GEE) model showed significant effects from the CBTM intervention over time. The experimental group showed significant improvement in sleep quality, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and significant increases in their mental and physical QOL from baseline, T1, T2, and T3&amp;amp;mdash;except for the mental and physical QOL showing no significant change at T3&amp;amp;mdash;while the control group receiving usual care showed no changes over time. The results suggest that CBTM increases sleep quality, reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, and enhances health-related QOL for participants. CBTM is efficacious and can be provided by nurses to enhance patients&amp;amp;rsquo; coping skills and consequently improve their QOL.</p>

                The precise mechanisms by which the information ecosystem polarizes society remain elusive. Focusing on political sorting in networks, we develop a computational model that examines how social network structure changes when individuals participate in information cascades, evaluate their behavior, and potentially rewire their connections to others as a result. Individuals...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The activity-dependent expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) has been utilized to label memory traces. However, their roles in engram specification are incompletely understood. Outstanding questions remain as to whether expression of IEGs can interplay with network properties such as functional connectivity and also if neurons expressing different IEGs are functionally distinct. In order to connect IEG expression at the cellular level with changes in functional connectivity, we investigated the expression of 2 IEGs, Arc and c-Fos, in cultured hippocampal neurons. Primary neuronal cultures were treated with a chemical cocktail [4-aminopyridine (4AP), bicuculline (Bic), and forskolin] to increase neuronal activity, IEG expression, and induce chemical long-term potentiation (LTP). Neuronal firing is assayed by intracellular calcium imaging using GCaMP6m and expression of IEGs is assessed by immunofluorescence staining. We noted an emergent network property of refinement in network activity, characterized by a global downregulation of correlated activity, together with an increase in correlated activity between subsets of specific neurons. Subsequently, we show that Arc expression correlates with the effects of refinement, as the increase in correlated activity occurs specifically between Arc-positive neurons. The expression patterns of the IEGs c-Fos and Arc strongly overlap, but Arc was more selectively expressed than c-Fos. A subpopulation of neurons positive for both Arc and c-Fos shows increased correlated activity, while correlated firing between Arc+/cFos&ndash; neurons is reduced. Our results relate neuronal activity-dependent expression of the IEGs Arc and c-Fos on the individual cellular level to changes in correlated activity of the neuronal network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Slinker: Visualising novel splicing events in RNA-Seq data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Visualisation of the transcriptome relative to a reference genome is fraught with sparsity. This is due to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) reads being predominantly mapped to exons that account for just under 3% of the human genome. Recently, we have used exon-only references, superTranscripts, to improve visualisation of aligned RNA-Seq data through the omission of supposedly unexpressed regions such as introns. However, variation within these regions can lead to novel splicing events that may drive a pathogenic phenotype. In these cases, the loss of information in only retaining annotated exons presents significant drawbacks. Here we present Slinker, a bioinformatics pipeline written in Python and Bpipe that uses a data-driven approach to assemble sample-specific superTranscripts. At its core, Slinker uses Stringtie2 to assemble transcripts with any sequence across any gene. This assembly is merged with reference transcripts, converted to a superTranscript, of which rich visualisations are made through Plotly with associated annotation and coverage information. Slinker was validated on five novel splicing events of rare disease samples from a cohort of primary muscular disorders. In addition, Slinker was shown to be effective in visualising deletion events within transcriptomes of tumour samples in the important leukemia gene, IKZF1. Slinker offers a succinct visualisation of RNA-Seq alignments across typically sparse regions and is freely available on Github.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancement of pyocyanin production by subinhibitory concentration of royal jelly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [version 4; peer review: 3 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, produces pyocyanin, a virulence factor associated with antibiotic tolerance. High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may potentially overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and clinical isolates were cultured in a royal jelly-containing medium to test the antibacterial activity. Pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm after 36 h culture and determined using extinction coefficient 4310 M-1 cm-1. Static microtiter plate biofilm assay performed to detect the biofilm formation, followed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Royal jelly effectively inhibited the viability of both strains from a concentration of 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC 10145, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Concentrations of 12.5% and 6.125% significantly induced biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, in line with the results of the SEM analysis. Conclusions: The royal jelly concentration of 25% or higher inhibits bacterial growth; however, the subinhibitory concentration increases pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. It is advisable to determine the appropriate concentration of royal jelly to obtain beneficial virulence inhibiting activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hebbian plasticity in parallel synaptic pathways: A circuit mechanism for systems memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michiel W. H. Remme, Urs Bergmann, Denis Alevi, Susanne Schreiber, Henning Sprekeler, Richard Kempter</p>

Systems memory consolidation involves the transfer of memories across brain regions and the transformation of memory content. For example, declarative memories that transiently depend on the hippocampal formation are transformed into long-term memory traces in neocortical networks, and procedural memories are transformed within cortico-striatal networks. These consolidation processes are thought to rely on replay and repetition of recently acquired memories, but the cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the changes of memories are poorly understood. Here, we suggest that systems memory consolidation could arise from Hebbian plasticity in networks with parallel synaptic pathways—two ubiquitous features of neural circuits in the brain. We explore this hypothesis in the context of hippocampus-dependent memories. Using computational models and mathematical analyses, we illustrate how memories are transferred across circuits and discuss why their representations could change. The analyses suggest that Hebbian plasticity mediates consolidation by transferring a linear approximation of a previously acquired memory into a parallel pathway. Our modelling results are further in quantitative agreement with lesion studies in rodents. Moreover, a hierarchical iteration of the mechanism yields power-law forgetting—as observed in psychophysical studies in humans. The predicted circuit mechanism thus bridges spatial scales from single cells to cortical areas and time scales from milliseconds to years.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Locus coeruleus neurons encode the subjective difficulty of triggering and executing actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pauline Bornert, Sebastien Bouret</p>

The brain stem noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) is involved in various costly processes: arousal, stress, and attention. Recent work has pointed toward an implication in physical effort, and indirect evidence suggests that the LC could be also involved in cognitive effort. To assess the dynamic relation between LC activity, effort production, and difficulty, we recorded the activity of 193 LC single units in 5 monkeys performing 2 discounting tasks (a delay discounting task and a force discounting task), as well as a simpler target detection task where conditions were matched for difficulty and only differed in terms of sensory-motor processes. First, LC neurons displayed a transient activation both when monkeys initiated an action and when exerting force. Second, the magnitude of the activation scaled with the associated difficulty, and, potentially, the corresponding amount of effort produced, both for decision and force production. Indeed, at action initiation in both discounting tasks, LC activation increased in conditions associated with lower average engagement rate, i.e., those requiring more cognitive control to trigger the response. Decision-related activation also scaled with response time (RT), over and above task parameters, in line with the idea that it reflects the amount of resources (here time) spent on the decision process. During force production, LC activation only scaled with the amount of force produced in the force discounting task, but not in the control target detection task, where subjective difficulty was equivalent across conditions. Our data show that LC neurons dynamically track the amount of effort produced to face both cognitive and physical challenges with a subsecond precision. This works provides key insight into effort processing and the contribution of the noradrenergic system, which is affected in several pathologies where effort is impaired, including Parkinson disease and depression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An informational sociobiological explanation of the constitution of the human body [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pedro Ortiz (1933-2011), in the latest four decades of his life, developed the Informational Sociobiological Theory (IST) in a university teaching context that became the foundation of post-grade studies in neuroscience in Peru. The IST looks for a totality explanation of the phenomena of the universe proposes an explanation of the constitution of the human body. In what consist this explanation of the configuration of the human body? Methods: A bibliographical qualitative study was conducted starting from primary documental sources. It was considered among the sources, all related to the editorial project Books of Social Psychobiologic (elaborated by Ortiz during the first decade of this age). The results have been presented across a conceptual analysis, narrative and graphic, oriented to expose Ortiz’ ideas in relation to the human body’s morphology. Results: The structural architecture of the human body, and in particular in one person; shows five levels of complexity which begins in cells, the intercellular matrix, the neural system, the paleocortical psyche, and neocortical psyche. In this involve explanation, the organs of the body are essentially tissue systems, and are integrated (subsumed) at the neural level (which informationally goes through the plexuses, ganglia, and subcortical nuclei). The two levels of superior complexity to the neural system, are the space of the psychic activity, unconscious and conscious, which is suprastructurally to all bodily structures. Ortiz is settled on a different monism: that guides us to imagine and think that all psychic activity is suprastructural to the body. Conclusions: There is an original explanation of the human body within the IST. This informational morphology dialogues with the knowledge of biology, neurology, anatomy, physiology, embryology, and histology, and is proposed as a structuring element in all the conceptual architecture that represents the IST.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and reducing mortality. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review focuses on vaccine injury compensation programs and highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods: Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We conclude that the vaccine injury compensation programs are available in limited number of countries across four continents - mostly in Europe. Lack of standard approach and scope of injury prevention and compensation programs across the countries exists. Some important limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Therefore, additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile perceived trust mediation on the intention and adoption of FinTech innovations using mobile technology: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The banking and financial sectors have witnessed a significant development recently due to financial technology (FinTech), and it has become an essential part of the financial system. Many factors helped the development of this sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust (MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured on the intention and adoption of the behaviour.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perception on Online Teaching and Learning Among Health Sciences Students in Higher Education Institutions during the COVID-19 Lockdown – Ways to Improve Teaching and Learning in Saudi Colleges and Universities [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Online learning or E-learning are approaches to broadcasting teaching by the means of internet technology and software applications. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is likewise embarking on the rapid growth in online education. The purpose of this study is to investigate the student’s perceptions regarding online teaching and learning during COVID 19. Methods: An online computer-based cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2020. A pre-validated questionnaire was used and administrated to health sciences students studying at Dammam Universities through online software QuestionPro. Results: Out of total 281, 68% of the participants were females (n=188) while 31.9% (n=88) were male students with an average age of 23.1(4.5) years. Overall, 176 (62%) of the students expressed their satisfaction with online learning. Conclusion: Findings will help academicians to identify strengths, areas of improvement, and encourage faculty to think deeply to restructure course learning objectives, teaching techniques to engage students and improve learning process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Globalization and life lost due to tuberculosis: evidence from a multi-country study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tuberculosis affects around 30% of the population of the world. Tuberculosis causes an increase in early mortality and thus has the potential to increase the number of years of life lost. Globalization directly or indirectly by affecting the factors that increase the susceptibility for tuberculosis infection has the potential to increase the spread and mortality due to tuberculosis. This study assessed the causal link between globalization and the years of life lost due to tuberculosis. Methods: Data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and World Bank for 2004 and 2005 were used for a number of covariates and possible mediators. Data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) were used for the outcome variable and important globalization indicators. The primary health outcome that was studied is tuberculosis and the measure that was used to quantify tuberculosis mortality is the years of life lost (YLL). Path analysis was used. Results: The main independent variables of economic and social integration were not statistically significant. For every unit increase in the proportion of people that were using treated drinking water, there was a -0.0002 decrease in the YLL due to tuberculosis. For every unit increase in the proportion of people with earth floor, there was a 0.0002 units increase in YLL due to tuberculosis. For every unit increase in the proportion of people living using clean fuel, there was a 0.0004 decrease in the YLL due to tuberculosis. Conclusions: Social and economic globalization have no effect on the years of life lost due to tuberculosis, highlighting that globalization actually does not contribute to tuberculosis mortality. However, improving other important determinants such as sanitation, providing safe drinking water and clean households will reduce the mortality due to tuberculosis, highlighting the need to invest in them.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Interleukin-17 affects synaptic plasticity and cognition in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Di Filippo et al. investigate the pathogenesis of hippocampal synaptopathy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, highlighting an IL-17A-centered neuro-immune cross-talk. Besides its well-known immunopathogenic roles, the IL-17 axis might be directly involved in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and cognition, with potential therapeutic implications for people with multiple sclerosis.

                Yang et al. demonstrate that SRC-2 in POMC neurons coordinates multifaceted adaptive responses to food shortage, including reducing energy expenditure, promoting counterregulation and suppressing satiation and anxiety to engage refeeding. These effects are mediated by SRC-2 functions to regulate POMC gene expression and modulate POMC neuron activities.

                Ruggiano et al. show that ubiquitylation and SUMOylation of DNA-protein crosslinks is linked to repair by SPRTN during DNA replication. Blocking SUMOylation causes double-strand breaks and switches the repair pathway to homologous recombination, potentially causing chromosomal rearrangements and genomic instability. Inactivation of DPC repair causes synthetic lethality in recombination-defective cells.

                The role of RNA-DNA hybrids in DNA damage repair remains unclear. Yang et al. reveal RNA-DNA hybrids form at ssDNA ends of DNA double-strand breaks to regulate both crossover and non-crossover recombination via affecting homolog bias during meiosis. The results demonstrate RNA-DNA hybrids actively regulate meiotic recombination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rat sensitivity to multipoint statistics is predicted by efficient coding of natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Efficient processing of sensory data requires adapting the neuronal encoding strategy to the statistics of natural stimuli. Previously, in Hermundstad et al., 2014, we showed that local multipoint correlation patterns that are most variable in natural images are also the most perceptually salient for human observers, in a way that is compatible with the efficient coding principle. Understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying such adaptation to image statistics will require performing invasive experiments that are impossible in humans. Therefore, it is important to understand whether a similar phenomenon can be detected in animal species that allow for powerful experimental manipulations, such as rodents. Here we selected four image statistics (from single- to four-point correlations) and trained four groups of rats to discriminate between white noise patterns and binary textures containing variable intensity levels of one of such statistics. We interpreted the resulting psychometric data with an ideal observer model, finding a sharp decrease in sensitivity from two- to four-point correlations and a further decrease from four- to three-point. This ranking fully reproduces the trend we previously observed in humans, thus extending a direct demonstration of efficient coding to a species where neuronal and developmental processes can be interrogated and causally manipulated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogen invasion-dependent tissue reservoirs and plasmid-encoded antibiotic degradation boost plasmid spread in the gut</a></h4>

              
                Many plasmids encode antibiotic resistance genes. Through conjugation, plasmids can be rapidly disseminated. Previous work identified gut luminal donor/recipient blooms and tissue-lodged plasmid-bearing persister cells of the enteric pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) that survive antibiotic therapy in host tissues, as factors promoting plasmid dissemination among Enterobacteriaceae. However, the buildup of tissue reservoirs and their contribution to plasmid spread await experimental demonstration. Here, we asked if re-seeding-plasmid acquisition-invasion cycles by <i>S</i>.Tm could serve to diversify tissue-lodged plasmid reservoirs, and thereby promote plasmid spread. Starting with intraperitoneal mouse infections, we demonstrate that <i>S</i>.Tm cells re-seeding the gut lumen initiate clonal expansion. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) plasmid-encoded gut luminal antibiotic degradation by donors can foster recipient survival under beta-lactam antibiotic treatment, enhancing transconjugant formation upon re-seeding. <i>S</i>.Tm transconjugants can subsequently re-enter host tissues introducing the new plasmid into the tissue-lodged reservoir. Population dynamics analyses pinpoint recipient migration into the gut lumen as rate-limiting for plasmid transfer dynamics in our model. Priority effects may be a limiting factor for reservoir formation in host tissues. Overall, our proof-of-principle data indicates that luminal antibiotic degradation and shuttling between the gut lumen and tissue-resident reservoirs can promote the accumulation and spread of plasmids within a host over time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanisms underlying microglial colonization of developing neural retina in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that function as the first line of defense in brain. Embryonic microglial precursors originate in peripheral mesoderm and migrate into the brain during development. However, the mechanism by which they colonize the brain is incompletely understood. The retina is one of the first brain regions to accommodate microglia. In zebrafish, embryonic microglial precursors use intraocular hyaloid blood vessels as a pathway to migrate into the optic cup via the choroid fissure. Once retinal progenitor cells exit the cell cycle, microglial precursors associated with hyaloid blood vessels start to infiltrate the retina preferentially through neurogenic regions, suggesting that colonization of retinal tissue depends upon the neurogenic state. Along with blood vessels and retinal neurogenesis, IL34 also participates in microglial precursor colonization of the retina. Altogether, CSF receptor signaling, blood vessels, and neuronal differentiation function as cues to create an essential path for microglial migration into developing retina.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Investigating the replicability of preclinical cancer biology</a></h4>

              
                Replicability is an important feature of scientific research, but aspects of contemporary research culture, such as an emphasis on novelty, can make replicability seem less important than it should be. The <a href="https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary – the replication was either a success or a failure – and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A conserved strategy for inducing appendage regeneration in moon                    jellyfish, Drosophila, and mice</a></h4>

              
                Can limb regeneration be induced? Few have pursued this question, and an                    evolutionarily conserved strategy has yet to emerge. This study reports a                    strategy for inducing regenerative response in appendages, which works across                    three species that span the animal phylogeny. In Cnidaria, the frequency of                    appendage regeneration in the moon jellyfish <i>Aurelia </i>was                    increased by feeding with the amino acid L-leucine and the growth hormone                    insulin. In insects, the same strategy induced tibia regeneration in adult                        <i>Drosophila</i>. Finally, in mammals, L-leucine and sucrose                    administration induced digit regeneration in adult mice, including dramatically                    from mid-phalangeal amputation. The conserved effect of L-leucine and                    insulin/sugar suggests a key role for energetic parameters in regeneration                    induction. The simplicity by which nutrient supplementation can induce appendage                    regeneration provides a testable hypothesis across animals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Challenges for assessing replicability in preclinical cancer biology</a></h4>

              
                We conducted the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were <i>extremely</i> or <i>very helpful</i> for 41% of experiments, they were <i>minimally helpful</i> for 9% of experiments, and <i>not at all helpful</i> (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication – it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortico-subcortical β burst dynamics underlying movement cancellation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Dominant neuroanatomical models hold that humans regulate their movements via loop-like cortico-subcortical networks, which include the subthalamic nucleus (STN), motor thalamus, and sensorimotor cortex (SMC). Inhibitory commands across these networks are purportedly sent via transient, burst-like signals in the β frequency (15-29Hz). However, since human depth-recording studies are typically limited to one recording site, direct evidence for this proposition is hitherto lacking. Here, we present simultaneous multi-site recordings from SMC and either STN or motor thalamus in humans performing the stop-signal task. In line with their purported function as inhibitory signals, subcortical β-bursts were increased on successful stop-trials. STN bursts in particular were followed within 50ms by increased β-bursting over SMC. Moreover, between-site comparisons (including in a patient with simultaneous recordings from SMC, thalamus, and STN) confirmed that β-bursts in STN temporally precede thalamic β-bursts. This highly unique set of recordings provides empirical evidence for the role of β-bursts in conveying inhibitory commands along long-proposed cortico-subcortical networks underlying movement regulation in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of long and short enhancers in melanoma cell states</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how enhancers drive cell type specificity and efficiently identifying them is essential for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. In melanoma, the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) states present themselves with different responses to therapy, making the identification of specific enhancers highly relevant. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in a panel of patient-derived melanoma lines (MM lines), we set to identify and decipher melanoma enhancers by first focusing on regions with state specific H3K27 acetylation close to differentially expressed genes. An in-depth evaluation of those regions was then pursued by investigating the activity of overlapping ATAC-seq peaks along with a full tiling of the acetylated regions with 190 bp sequences. Activity was observed in more than 60% of the selected regions and we were able to precisely locate the active enhancers within ATAC-seq peaks. Comparison of sequence content with activity, using the deep learning model DeepMEL2, revealed that AP-1 alone is responsible for the MES enhancer activity. In contrast, SOX10 and MITF both influence MEL enhancer function with SOX10 being required to achieve high levels of activity. Overall, our MPRAs shed light on the relationship between long and short sequences in terms of their sequence content, enhancer activity, and specificity across melanoma cell states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Highly synergistic combinations of nanobodies that target SARS-CoV-2 and are resistant to escape</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies and urgently demands powerful new therapeutics that can resist viral escape. We therefore generated a large nanobody repertoire to saturate the distinct and highly conserved available epitope space of SARS-CoV-2 spike, including the S1 receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain, and the S2 subunit, to identify new nanobody binding sites that may reflect novel mechanisms of viral neutralization. Structural mapping and functional assays show that indeed these highly stable monovalent nanobodies potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, display numerous neutralization mechanisms, are effective against emerging variants of concern, and are resistant to mutational escape. Rational combinations of these nanobodies that bind to distinct sites within and between spike subunits exhibit extraordinary synergy and suggest multiple tailored therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.

                As part of the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a>, we published Registered Reports that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from 29 high-impact preclinical cancer biology papers published between 2010 and 2012. Replication experiments were completed and Replication Studies reporting the results were submitted for 18 papers, of which 17 were accepted and published by <i>eLife</i> with the rejected paper posted as a preprint. Here, we report the status and outcomes obtained for the remaining 11 papers. Four papers initiated experimental work but were stopped without any experimental outcomes. Two papers resulted in incomplete outcomes due to unanticipated challenges when conducting the experiments. For the remaining five papers only some of the experiments were completed with the other experiments incomplete due to mundane technical or unanticipated methodological challenges. The experiments from these papers, along with the other experiments attempted as part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, provides evidence about the challenges of repeating preclinical cancer biology experiments and the replicability of the completed experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Serine ADP-ribosylation marks nucleosomes for ALC1-dependent chromatin remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Serine ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a DNA damage-induced post-translational modification catalyzed by the PARP1/2:HPF1 complex. As the list of PARP1/2:HPF1 substrates continues to expand, there is a need for technologies to prepare mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins for biochemical interrogation. Here we investigate the unique peptide ADPr activities catalyzed by PARP1 in the absence and presence of HPF1. We then exploit these activities to develop a method that facilitates installation of ADP-ribose polymers onto peptides with precise control over chain length and modification site. Importantly, the enzymatically mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides are fully compatible with protein ligation technologies. This chemoenzymatic protein synthesis strategy was employed to assemble a series of full-length, ADP-ribosylated histones and show that ADPr at H2BS6 or H3S10 converts nucleosomes into robust substrates for the chromatin remodeler ALC1. We found ALC1 preferentially remodels 'activated' substrates within heterogeneous mononucleosome populations and asymmetrically ADP-ribosylated dinucleosome substrates, and that nucleosome serine ADPr is sufficient to stimulate ALC1 activity in nuclear extracts. Our study identifies a biochemical function for nucleosome serine ADPr and describes a new, highly modular approach to explore the impact that site-specific serine mono- and poly-ADPr have on protein function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of the endogenous DAF-12 ligand and its use as an anthelmintic agent in Strongyloides stercoralis</a></h4>

              
                A prevalent feature of <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> is a life-long and potentially lethal infection that is due to the nematode parasite’s ability to autoinfect and, thereby, self-replicate within its host. Here, we investigated the role of the parasite’s nuclear receptor, <i>Ss-</i>DAF-12, in governing infection. We identified Δ7-DA as the endogenous <i>Ss-</i>DAF-12 ligand and elucidated the hormone’s biosynthetic pathway. Genetic loss of function of the ligand’s rate-limiting enzyme demonstrated that Δ7-DA synthesis is necessary for parasite reproduction, whereas its absence is required for the development of infectious larvae. Availability of the ligand permits <i>Ss-</i>DAF-12 to function as an on/off switch governing autoinfection, making it vulnerable to therapeutic intervention. In a preclinical model of hyperinfection, pharmacologic activation of DAF-12 suppressed autoinfection and markedly reduced lethality. Moreover, when Δ7-DA was administered with ivermectin, the current but limited drug of choice for treating strongyloidiasis, the combinatorial effects of the two drugs resulted in a near cure of the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Is preclinical research in cancer biology reproducible enough?</a></h4>

              
                The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RPCB) was established to provide evidence about reproducibility in basic and preclinical cancer research, and to identify the factors that influence reproducibility more generally. In this commentary we address some of the scientific, ethical and policy implications of the project. We liken the basic and preclinical cancer research enterprise to a vast 'diagnostic machine' that is used to determine which clinical hypotheses should be advanced for further development, including clinical trials. The results of the RPCB suggest that this diagnostic machine currently recommends advancing many findings that are not reproducible. While concerning, we believe that more work needs to be done to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic machine. Specifically, we believe three questions remain unanswered: how often does the diagnostic machine correctly recommend against advancing real effects to clinical testing?; what are the relative costs to society of false positive and false negatives?; and how well do scientists and others interpret the outputs of the machine?

                The peripheral branch of sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons regenerates readily after injury unlike their central branch in the spinal cord. However extensive regeneration and reconnection of sensory axons in the spinal cord can be driven by the expression of 9 integrin and its activator kindlin-1(9k1), which enable axons to interact with tenascin-C. To elucidate the mechanisms and downstream pathways affected by activated integrin expression and central regeneration, we conducted transcriptomic analyses of DRG sensory neurons transduced with 9k1, and controls, with and without axotomy of the central branch. Expression of 9k1 without the central axotomy led to upregulation of a known PNS regeneration program, including many genes associated with peripheral nerve regeneration. Coupling 9k1 treatment with dorsal root axotomy led to extensive central axonal regeneration and caused expression of a distinctive CNS regeneration program, including genes associated with ubiquitination, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum, trafficking, and signalling. Pharmacological inhibition of these processes blocked the regeneration of axons from DRGs and human iPS-derived sensory neurons, validating their causal contributions. This CNS regeneration-associated program showed little correlation with either embryonic development or PNS regeneration programs. Potential transcriptional drivers of this CNS program coupled to regeneration include Mef2a, Runx3, E2f4, Tfeb, Yy1. Signalling from integrins primes sensory neurons for regeneration, but their axon growth in the CNS is associated with a distinctive program that differs from that involved in PNS regeneration.

                The precise control of growth and maintenance of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite arborization is critical for normal visual functions in mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we find that the m6A reader YTHDF2 is highly expressed in the mouse RGCs. Conditional knockout (cKO) of Ythdf2 in the retina leads to increased RGC dendrite branching, resulting in more synapses in the inner plexiform layer. Interestingly, the Ythdf2 cKO mice show improved visual acuity compared with control mice. We further demonstrate that Ythdf2 cKO in the retina protects RGCs from dendrite degeneration caused by the experimental acute glaucoma model. We identify the m6A-modified YTHDF2 target transcripts which mediate these effects. This study reveals mechanisms by which YTHDF2 restricts RGC dendrite development and maintenance. YTHDF2 and its target mRNAs might be valuable in developing new treatment approaches for glaucomatous eyes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Analysis of visual processing capabilities and neural coding strategies of a detailed model for laminar cortical microcircuits in mouse V1</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex is a network of rather stereotypical cortical microcircuits that share an exquisite genetically encoded architecture: Neurons of a fairly large number of different types are distributed over several layers (laminae), with specific probabilities of synaptic connections that depend on the neuron types involved and their spatial locations. Most available knowledge about this structure has been compiled into a detailed model for a generic cortical microcircuit in the primary visual cortex, consisting of 51,978 neurons of 111 different types. We add a noise model to the network that is based on experimental data, and analyze the results of network computations that can be extracted by projection neurons on layer 5. We show that the resulting model acquires through alignment of its synaptic weights via gradient descent training the capability to carry out a number of demanding visual processing tasks. Furthermore, this weight-alignment induces specific neural coding features in the microcircuit model that match those found in the living brain: High dimensional neural codes with an arguably close to optimal power-law decay of explained variance of PCA components, specific relations between signal- and noise-coding dimensions, and network dynamics in a critical regime. Hence these important features of neural coding and dynamics of cortical microcircuits in the brain are likely to emerge from aspects of their genetically encoded architecture that are captured by this data-based model in combination with learning processes. In addition, the model throws new light on the relation between visual processing capabilities and details of neural coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of certainty and valence in cardiac autonomic regulation mediated by high depressive risk</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies highlight interoception as the key to processing healthy emotion and pathophysiology of affective disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). It has been reported that interoceptive responses are impaired in MDD and in healthy individuals with a high depressive risk (HDR). However, it is unclear how individual differences in HDR relate to neurophysiological underpinnings for interoceptive and emotional reactions under different degrees of certainty. We examined whether HDR mediates the relationship between a neuro-physiological marker for interoception, heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), and an index for cardiac reactivity, heart rate (HR) or heart rate variability (HRV). In a concurrent EEG-ECG experiment, 26 healthy participants underwent an emotion-evoking picture evaluation task. One of three differential auditory tones associated with a level of certainty preceded display of a pleasant or unpleasant picture. The results showed attenuated HRV activity for certain cues in HDR individuals. Neural and physiological reactions to uncertain, unpleasant pictures were enhanced by the depressive risk. These results suggest reduced responses in prediction processing and enlarged precision-weighted prediction error for unpleasant pictures. Finally, HDR significantly mediated the HEP and HR relationship for unexpected unpleasant stimuli. Our study thus provides evidence that interoceptive predictive coding in the cardiac domain is altered by HDR, and suggests that investigating the heart-brain interaction related to predictive coding will offer insights into how to estimate the level of depressive risk.

                Axonal transport ensures long-range delivery of essential cargoes between proximal and distal compartments of neurons, and is needed for neuronal development, function, and survival. Deficits in axonal transport have been detected at pre-symptomatic stages in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting that impairments are fundamental for disease pathogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for the transport deficits and whether they preferentially affect -motor neuron (MN) subtypes remain unresolved. Here, we report that stimulation of wild-type neurons with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances trafficking of signalling endosomes specifically in fast MNs (FMNs). In early symptomatic SOD1G93A mice, FMNs display selective impairment of axonal transport and develop an insensitivity to BDNF stimulation, with pathology upregulating classical non-pro-survival receptors in muscles and sciatic nerves. Altogether, these data indicate that cell- and non-cell autonomous BDNF signalling is impaired in vulnerable SOD1G93A MNs, thus identifying a new key deficit in ALS amenable for future therapeutic interventions.

                The capacity to elicit vivid visual mental images varies within an extensive range across individuals between hyper- and aphantasia. It is not clear, however, whether imagery vividness is constant across the lifespan or changes during development and later in life. Without enforcing the constraints of strict experimental procedures and representativity across the entire population, our purpose was to take a first look at the self-reported level of imagery vividness and determine the relative proportion of aphantasic/hyperphantasic participants in different age-groups. Relying on the frequently used Vividness of Visual Mental Imagery questionnaire, we collected data on a random sample of 2252 participants between the ages of 12 to 60 years. We found a novel developmental pattern describing a declining ability to elicit vivid visual mental images in the group averages of different age-groups from adolescence to middle age. This effect involves both a decreasing proportion of individuals with very vivid imagery and an increasing proportion of individuals with weak imagery as maturation (assessed by boneage estimations in adolescents) and aging progresses. This finding may help to shed light on yet unknown developmental mechanisms of our internal, stimulus-independent processes, and might also help to determine genetic, maturational, and age-dependent factors in the extreme cases of hyper- and aphantasia.

                Learning engages a high-dimensional neuronal population space spanning multiple brain regions. We identified a low-dimensional signature associated with operant conditioning, a ubiquitous form of learning in which animals learn from the consequences of behavior. Using single-neuron resolution voltage imaging, we identified two low-dimensional motor modules in the neuronal population underlying Aplysia feeding. Our findings point to a temporal shift in module recruitment as the primary signature of operant learning.

                Here we introduce a multimodal framework to identify subspaces in the human brain that are defined by collective changes in structural and functional measures and are actively linked to demographic, biological and cognitive indicators in a population. We determine the multimodal subspaces using principles of active subspace learning (ASL) and demonstrate its application on a sample learning task (biological ageing) on a Schizophrenia dataset. The proposed multimodal ASL method successfully identifies latent brain representations as subsets of brain regions and connections forming co-varying subspaces in association with biological age. We show that Schizophrenia is characterized by different subspace patterns compared to those in a cognitively normal brain. The multimodal features generated by projecting structural and functional MRI components onto these active subspaces perform better than several PCA-based transformations and equally well when compared to non-transformed features on the studied learning task. In essence, the proposed method successfully learns active brain subspaces associated with a specific brain condition but inferred from the brain imaging data along with the biological/cognitive traits of interest.

                Myelination influences brain connectivity during sensitive periods of development by enhancing neural signaling speed and regulating synapse formation to reduce plasticity. However, in vivo studies characterizing the maturational timing of cortical myelination during human development remain scant. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in high-resolution cortical T1w/T2w myelin mapping methods, including principled correction of B1+ transmit field effects, using data from the Human Connectome Project in Development (N=628, ages 8-21) to characterize the maturational timing of myelination from childhood through early adulthood throughout the cerebral neocortex. We apply Bayesian spline models and functional latent clustering analysis to demonstrate graded variation in the rate of cortical T1w/T2w myelin growth in neocortical areas that is strongly correlated with the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis of cortical organization reported by others. In sensorimotor areas T1w/T2w myelin starts at high levels at early ages, increases at a fast pace, and decelerates at later ages (18-21). In intermediate multimodal areas along the S-A axis, T1w/T2w myelin tends to start at intermediate levels and increase linearly at an intermediate pace. In transmodal and paralimbic association areas high along the S-A axis, T1w/T2w myelin tends to start at low levels and increase linearly at the slowest pace. These data provide evidence for graded variation along the S-A axis in the rate of cortical myelination during adolescence, which could reflect ongoing plasticity underlying the development of complex information processing and psychological functioning.

                The accumulation of multisite large-sample MRI datasets collected by large brain research projects in the last decade has provided a critical resource for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, the significant site effects, observed in the imaging data and their derived structural and functional features, has prevented the derivation of consistent findings across different studies. The development of harmonization methods that can effectively eliminate complex site effects while maintaining biological characteristics in neuroimaging data has become a vital and urgent requirement for multisite imaging studies. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based framework to harmonize imaging data from pairs of sites, in which site factors and brain features can be disentangled and encoded. We trained the proposed framework with a publicly available traveling-subject dataset from SRPBS and harmonized the gray matter volume maps from eight source sites to a target site. The proposed framework significantly eliminated inter-site differences in gray matter volume. The embedded encoders successfully captured both the abstract texture of site factors and the concrete brain features. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibited outstanding performance relative to conventional statistical harmonization methods in site effect removal, data distribution homogenization, and intra-subject similarity improvement. Together, the proposed method offers a powerful and interpretable deep learning-based harmonization framework for multisite neuroimaging data that could enhance reliability and reproducibility in multisite studies for brain development and brain disorders.

                Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators have been broadly used to monitor neuronal activity in live animals, but invasive surgical procedures are required. This study presents a functional bioluminescence imaging (fBLI) method for recording the activity of neuronal ensembles in the brain in awake mice. We developed a luciferase prosubstrate activatable in vivo by nonspecific esterase to enhance the brain delivery of the luciferin. We further engineered a bright, bioluminescent indicator with robust responsiveness to calcium ions (Ca2+) and appreciable emission above 600 nm. Integration of these advantageous components enabled the imaging of Ca2+ dynamics in awake mice minimally invasively with excellent signal-to-background and subsecond temporal resolution. This study thus establishes a new paradigm for studying brain functions in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PACAP-PAC1 Receptor Inhibition is Effective in Models of Opioid-Induced Medication Overuse Headache</a></h4>

              
                Opioids are regularly prescribed for migraine and can result in medication overuse headache and dependence. We recently showed that pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is upregulated following opioid administration or in a model of chronic migraine. The goal of this study was to determine if PACAP was a link between opioid use and headache chronification. We tested the effect of PACAP-PAC1 receptor inhibition in novel models of opioid-exacerbated migraine pain and aura; and examined the co-expression between mu opioid receptor (MOR), PAC1, and PACAP in headache-associated brain and peripheral regions. To model opioid exacerbated migraine pain, mice were injected daily with morphine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle for 11 days. On days 3,5,7,9, and 11 they also received the known human migraine trigger nitroglycerin (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle. To model opioid exacerbated aura, mice were treated with vehicle or morphine twice daily for 4 days (20 mg/kg on days 1-3, 40 mg/kg on day 4), a well established paradigm for causing opioid-induced hyperalgesia. On day 5 they underwent cortical spreading depression, a physiological correlate of migraine aura. The effect of the PAC1 inhibitor, M65 (0.1 mg/kg), was tested in these models. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to investigate the expression of MOR, PAC1, and PACAP. Only mice treated with combined morphine and nitroglycerin developed chronic cephalic allodynia (n=18/group). M65 reversed this hypersensitivity (n=9/group). Morphine significantly increased the number of CSD events (n=8-9/group); and M65 decreased this exacerbation by morphine (n=8-12/group). PAC1 and/or PACAP were highly coexpressed with MOR, and varied by region (n=6/group). MOR and PACAP were coexpressed in the trigeminal ganglia, while MOR and PAC1 receptor showed near complete overlap in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and periaqueductal gray. The cortex showed similar cellular co-expression between MOR-PACAP and MOR-PAC1. These results show that opioids facilitate the transition to chronic headache through induction of PACAPergic mechanisms. Antibodies or pharmacological agents targeting PACAP or PAC1 receptor may be particularly beneficial for the treatment of opioidinduced medication overuse headache.

                In insect olfaction, sensitization refers to the amplification of a weak olfactory signal when the stimulus is repeated within a specific time window. In the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, his occurs already at the periphery, at the level of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located in the antenna. In our study, we investigate whether sensitization is a widespread property in a set of seven types of OSNs, as well as the mechanisms involved. First, we characterize and compare differences in spontaneous activity, response velocity and response dynamics among the selected OSN types. These express different receptors with distinct tuning properties and behavioral relevance. Second, we show that sensitization is not a general property. Among our selected OSNs types, it occurs in those responding to more general food odors, while OSNs involved in very specific detection of highly specific ecological cues like pheromones and warning signals show no sensitization. Moreover, we show that mitochondria play an active role in sensitization by contributing to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ upon weak receptor activation. Thus, by using a combination of single sensillum recordings (SSR), calcium imaging and pharmacology, we widen the understanding of how the olfactory signal is processed at the periphery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics of causal inference in the macaque frontoparietal circuit</a></h4>

              
                Natural perception relies inherently on inferring causal structure in the environment. However, the neural mechanisms and functional circuits that are essential for representing and updating the hidden causal structure and corresponding sensory representations during multisensory processing are unknown. To address this, monkeys were trained to infer the probability of a potential common source from visual and proprioceptive signals on the basis of their spatial disparity in a virtual reality system. The proprioceptive drift reported by monkeys demonstrated that they combined historical information and current multisensory signals to estimate the hidden common source and subsequently updated both the causal structure and sensory representation. Single-unit recordings in premotor and parietal cortices revealed that neural activity in premotor cortex represents the core computation of causal inference, characterizing the estimation and update of the likelihood of integrating multiple sensory inputs at a trial-by-trial level. In response to signals from premotor cortex, neural activity in parietal cortex also represents the causal structure and further dynamically updates the sensory representation to maintain consistency with the causal inference structure. Thus, our results indicate how premotor cortex integrates historical information and sensory inputs to infer hidden variables and selectively updates sensory representations in parietal cortex to support behavior. This dynamic loop of frontal-parietal interactions in the causal inference framework may provide the neural mechanism to answer long-standing questions regarding how neural circuits represent hidden structures for body-awareness and agency.

                The separation of distinct motor memories by contextual cues is a well known and well studied phenomenon of feedforward human motor control. However, there is no clear evidence of such context-induced separation in feedback control. Here we test both experimentally and computationally if context-dependent switching of feedback controllers is possible in the human motor system. Specifically, we probe visuomotor feedback responses of our human participants in two different tasks - stop and hit - and under two different schedules. The first, blocked schedule, is used to measure the behaviour of stop and hit controllers in isolation, showing that it can only be described by two independent controllers with two different sets of control gains. The second, mixed schedule, is then used to compare how such behaviour evolves when participants regularly switch from one task to the other. Our results support our hypothesis that there is contextual switching of feedback controllers, further extending the accumulating evidence of shared features between feedforward and feedback control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling hand and tool processing: distal effects of neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                The neural processing within a brain region that responds to more than one object category can be separated by looking at the horizontal modulations established by that region, which suggests that local representations can be affected by connections to distal areas, in a category-specific way. Here we first wanted to test whether by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to a region that responds both to hands and tools (posterior middle temporal gyrus; pMTG), while participants performed either a hand- or tool-related training task, we would be able to specifically target the trained category, and thereby dissociate the overlapping neural processing. Second, we wanted to see if these effects were limited to the target area or extended to distal but functionally connected brain areas. After each combined tDCS and training session, participants therefore viewed images of tools, hands, and animals, in an fMRI scanner. Using multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that tDCS stimulation to pMTG indeed improved the classification accuracy between tools vs. animals, but only when combined with a tool training task (not a hand training task). However, surprisingly, tDCS stimulation to pMTG also improved the classification accuracy between hands vs. animals when combined with a tool training task (not a hand training task). Our findings suggest that overlapping but functionally-specific networks can be separated by using a category-specific training task together with tDCS - a strategy that can be applied more broadly to other cognitive domains using tDCS - and demonstrates the importance of horizontal modulations in object-category representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Short latency stretch reflexes depend on the balance of activity in agonist and antagonist muscles during ballistic elbow movements</a></h4>

              
                The spinal stretch reflex is a fundamental building block of motor function, modulating sensitivity across tasks to augment volitional control. Stretch reflex sensitivity can vary continuously during movement and changes between movement and posture. While there have been many demonstrations of reflex modulation and investigations into the underlying mechanisms, there have been few attempts to provide simple, quantitative descriptions of the relationship between the volitional control and stretch reflex sensitivity throughout tasks that require the coordinated activity of several muscles. Here we develop such a description and use it to test the hypothesis that the modulation of stretch reflex sensitivity during movement can be explained by the balance of activity within the relevant agonist and antagonist muscles better than by the activity only in the muscle homonymous with the elicited reflex. We applied continuous pseudo-random perturbations of elbow angle as subjects completed approximately 500 movements in elbow flexion and extension. Measurements were averaged across the repeated movements to obtain continuous estimates of stretch reflex amplitude and background muscle activity. We also ran a control experiment on a subset of subjects performing postural tasks at muscle activity levels matched to those measured in the movement task. For both experiments, we assessed the relationship between background activity in the agonist and antagonist muscles controlling elbow movement and the stretch reflexes elicited in them. We found that modulation in the stretch reflexes during movement can be described by modulation of the background activity in the agonist and antagonist muscles, and that models incorporating agonists and antagonists are significantly better than those considering only the homonymous muscle. Increases in agonist muscle activity enhanced stretch reflex sensitivity whereas increases in antagonist activity suppressed reflex activity. Surprisingly, the magnitude of these effects was similar, suggesting a balance of control between agonists and antagonist that is very different than the dominance of sensitivity to agonist activity during postural tasks. This greater relative sensitivity to antagonist background activity during movement is due to a large decrease in sensitivity to homonymous muscle activity during movement rather than substantial changes in the influence of antagonist muscle activity.

                The use of low sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics (microdosing) has gained popularity in recent years. Although anecdotal reports claim multiple benefits associated with this practice, the lack of placebo-controlled studies limits our knowledge of microdosing and its effects. Moreover, research conducted in laboratory settings might fail to capture the motivation of individuals engaged in microdosing protocols. We recruited 34 individuals planning to microdose with psilocybin mushrooms (Psilocybe cubensis), one of the materials most frequently used for this purpose. Following a double-blind placebo-controlled design, we investigated the effects of 0.5 g dried mushrooms on subjective experience, behavior, creativity, perception, cognition, and brain activity. The reported acute effects were significantly more intense for the active dose compared to the placebo, which could be explained by unblinding. For the other measurements, we observed either null effects or a trend towards cognitive impairment and, in the case of EEG, towards reduced theta band spectral power. Our findings support the possibility that expectation effects underlie at least some of the anecdotal benefits attributed to microdosing with psilocybin mushrooms.

                Mice have a constellation of higher visual areas, but their functional specializations are unclear. Here, we used a data-driven approach to examine neuronal representations of complex visual stimuli across mouse higher visual areas, measured using large field-of-view two-photon calcium imaging. Using specialized stimuli, we found higher fidelity representations of texture in area LM, compared to area AL. Complementarily, we found higher fidelity representations of motion in area AL, compared to area LM. We also observed this segregation of information in response to naturalistic videos. Finally, we explored how popular models of visual cortical neurons could produce the segregated representations of texture and motion we observed. These selective representations could aid in behaviors such as visually guided navigation.

                A key requirement for the repeated identification of a stimulus is a reliable neural representation each time it is encountered. Neural coding is often considered to rely on two major coding schemes: the firing rate of action potentials, known as rate coding, and the precise timing of action potentials, known as temporal coding. Synaptic transmission is the major mechanism of information transfer between neurons. While theoretical studies have examined the effects of neurotransmitter release probability on neural code reliability, it has not yet been addressed how different components of the release machinery affect coding of physiological stimuli in vivo. Here, we use the first synapse of the Drosophila olfactory system to show that the reliability of the neural code is sensitive to perturbations of specific presynaptic proteins controlling distinct stages of neurotransmitter release. Notably, the presynaptic manipulations decreased coding reliability of postsynaptic neurons only at high odor intensity. We further show that while the reduced temporal code reliability arises from monosynaptic effects, the reduced rate code reliability arises from circuit effects, which include the recruitment of inhibitory local neurons. Finally, we find that reducing neural coding reliability decreases behavioral reliability of olfactory stimulus classification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep Dependent Changes of Lactate Concentration in Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Lactate is an important cellular metabolite that is present at high concentrations in the brain, both within cells and in the extracellular space between cells. Small animal studies demonstrated high extracellular concentrations of lactate during wakefulness with reductions during sleep and/or anesthesia with a recent study suggesting the glymphatic activity as the mechanism for the reduction of lactate concentrations. We have recently developed a rigorous non-invasive imaging approach combining simultaneous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and polysomnography (PSG) measurements, and here, we present the first in-vivo evaluation of brain lactate levels during sleep-wake cycles in young healthy humans. First, we collected single voxel proton MRS (1H-MRS) data at the posterior cingulate with high temporal resolution (every 7.5 sec), and simultaneously recorded PSG data while temporally registering with 1H-MRS time-series. Second, we evaluated PSG data in 30 s epochs, and classified into four stages Wake (W), Non-REM sleep stage 1 (N1), Non-REM sleep stage 2 (N2), and Non-REM sleep stage 3 (N3). Third, we determined lactate signal intensity from each 7.5-s spectrum, normalized to corresponding water signal, and averaged over 30-s for each PSG epoch. In examinations of nine healthy participants (four females, five males; mean age 24.2 ({+/-} 2; SD) years; age range: 21-27 years) undergoing up to 3-hour simultaneous MRS/PSG recordings, we observed a group mean reduction of [4.9 {+/-} 4.9] % in N1, [10.4 {+/-} 5.2] % in N2, and [24.0 {+/-} 5.8] % in N3 when compared to W. Our finding is consistent with more than 70 years of invasive lactate measurements from small animal studies. In addition, reduced brain lactate was accompanied by a significant reduction the apparent diffusion coefficient of brain lactate. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the loss of lactate from the extracellular space during sleep while suggesting lactate metabolism is altered and/or lactate clearance via glymphatic exchange is increased during sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endurance exercise ameliorates phenotypes in Drosophila models of Spinocerebellar Ataxias</a></h4>

              
                Endurance exercise is a potent intervention with widespread benefits proven to reduce disease incidence and impact across species. While endurance exercise supports neural plasticity, enhanced memory, and reduced neurodegeneration, less is known about the effect of chronic exercise on the progression of movement disorders such as ataxias. Here, we focused on three different types of ataxias, Spinocerebellar Ataxias Type (SCAs) 2, 3, and 6, belonging to the polyglutamine (polyQ) family of neurodegenerative disorders. In Drosophila models of these SCAs, flies progressively lose motor function. Here, we observe marked protection of speed and endurance in exercised SCA2 flies and modest protection in exercised SCA6 models, while no benefit is observed in SCA3 flies. Causative protein levels are reduced in SCA2 flies after chronic exercise, but not in SCA3 models, linking protein levels to exercise-based benefits. Additional investigations indicate that the exercise-inducible protein, Sestrin (Sesn) suppresses mobility decline and improves early death in SCA2 flies, even without exercise, coincident with disease protein level reduction and increased autophagic flux. These improvements depend on previously established functions of Sesn that reduce oxidative damage and modulate mTOR activity. Our study suggests differential responses of polyQ SCAs to exercise, highlighting the potential for more extensive application of exercise-based therapies in the prevention of polyQ neurodegeneration. Defining the mechanisms by which endurance exercise suppresses polyQ SCAs will open the door for more effective treatment for these diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A tool for the in vivo gating of gene expression in neurons using the co-occurrence of neural activity and light</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in genetically based technologies have begun to allow us to better understand the relationships between underlying neural activity and the patterns of measurable behavior that can be reproducibly studied in the laboratory. As this field develops, there are key limitations to the currently available technologies hindering their full potential to deliver meaningful datasets. The limitations which are most critical to advancement of these technologies in behavioral neuroscience are: the temporal resolution at which physiological events can be windowed, the divergent molecular pathways in signal transduction that introduce ambiguity into the output of activity sensors, and the impractical size of the genetic material that requires 3-4 separate AAV vectors to deliver a fully functional system into a cell. To address these limitations and help bring the potential of these types of technologies into better realization, we have engineered a nucleus localized light-sensitive Ca2+-dependent gene expression system based on AsLOV2 and the downstream responsive element antagonist modulator (DREAM). The design and engineering of each component was performed in such a way to: 1) preserve behaviorally relevant temporal dynamics, 2) preserve signal fidelity appropriate for studying experience-driven neural activity patterns and their relationship to specific animal responses, and 3) have full delivery of the genetic material via a single AAV vector. The system was tested in vitro and subsequently in vivo with neural activity induced by Channelrhodopsin and could be used in the future with behaviorally-driven neural activity. To our knowledge this is the first optogenetic tool for the practical use of linking activity-dependent gene activation in response to direct nuclear calcium transduction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational simulations and Ca2+ imaging reveal that slow synaptic depolarizations (slow EPSPs) inhibit fast EPSP evoked action potentials for most of their time course in enteric neurons</a></h4>

              
                Transmission between neurons in the extensive enteric neural networks of the gut involves synaptic potentials with vastly different time courses and underlying conductances. Most enteric neurons exhibit fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) lasting 20-50 ms, but many also exhibit slow EPSPs that last up to 100 s. When large enough, slow EPSPs excite action potentials at the start of the slow depolarization, but how they affect action potentials evoked by fast EPSPs is unknown. Furthermore, two other sources of synaptic depolarization probably occur in enteric circuits, activated via GABA A or GABA C receptors; how these interact with other synaptic depolarizations is also unclear. We built a compartmental model of enteric neurons incorporating realistic voltage-dependent ion channels, then simulated fast EPSPs, slow EPSPs and GABA A or GABA C ligand-gated Cl - channels to explore these interactions. Model predictions were tested by imaging Ca 2+ transients in myenteric neurons ex vivo as an indicator of their activity during synaptic interactions. The model could mimic firing of myenteric neurons in mouse colon evoked by depolarizing current during intracellular recording and the fast and slow EPSPs in these neurons. Subthreshold fast EPSPs evoked spikes during the rising phase of a slow EPSP, but suprathreshold fast EPSPs could not evoke spikes later in a slow EPSP. This predicted inhibition was confirmed by Ca 2+ imaging in which stimuli that evoke slow EPSPs suppressed activity evoked by fast EPSPs in many myenteric neurons. The model also predicted that synchronous activation of GABA A receptors and fast EPSPs potentiated firing evoked by the latter, while synchronous activation of GABA C receptors with fast EPSPs, potentiated firing and then suppressed it. The results reveal that so-called slow EPSPs have a biphasic effect being likely to suppress fast EPSP evoked firing over very long periods, perhaps accounting for prolonged quiescent periods seen in enteric motor patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visualizing cell death in live retina: Using calpain activity detection as a biomarker for retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Calpains are a family of calcium-activated proteases involved in numerous disorders. Notably, previous studies have shown that calpain activity was substantially increased in various models for inherited retinal degeneration (RD). In the present study, we tested the capacity of the t-BOC-Leu-Met-CMAC calpain-specific substrate to detect calpain activity in living retina, in organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice, as well as from rd1 and RhoP23H/+ RD-mutant mice. Test conditions were refined until the calpain substrate readily detected large numbers of cells in the photoreceptor layer of RD retina but not in wild-type retina. At the same time, the calpain substrate was not obviously toxic to photoreceptor cells. Comparison of calpain activity with an immunostaining for activated calpain-2 furthermore suggested that individual calpain isoforms may be active in distinct temporal stages of photoreceptor cell death. Notably, calpain-2 activity may be a relatively short-lived event, occurring only towards the end of the cell death process. Finally, our results support the development of calpain activity detection as a novel in vivo biomarker for RD, suitable for combination with non-invasive imaging techniques.

                Interoception plays an important role in emotion processing, but the relationship between the physiological responses associated with emotional experience and interoception is unclear. In this study, we measured interoceptive sensitivity using the heartbeat discrimination task and investigated the effects of individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity on changes in heart rate and insula activity in response to music-induced emotions. We found that the heart rate increased when listening to the music pieces rated as emotionally high-touching in the high interoceptive sensitivity group only. Compared to the emotionally low-touching music, listening to the emotionally high-touching music was associated with higher insula activity. Furthermore, relative to individuals with low interoceptive sensitivity, the region of interest analysis of the insula subregions for individuals with high interoceptive sensitivity revealed significant activity in the bilateral dorsal granular insula, the right ventral dysgranular insula, and the right granular and dorsal dysgranular insula while listening to the high-touching music pieces. Our results suggest that individuals with high interoceptive sensitivity use their physical condition to assess their emotional level when listening to music. Furthermore, the insula activity may reflect the use of interoception to estimate emotions.

                The complexity of the signaling events, cellular responses unfolding in neuronal, glial and immune cells upon Traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes an obstacle in elucidating pathophysiological links and targets for intervention. We used array phosphoproteomics in a murine mild blunt TBI to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of tyrosine-kinase signaling in TBI and then to scrutinize the large-scale effects of the perturbation of cMet/HGFR, VEGFR1 and Btk signaling by small molecules. cMet/HGFR emerged as a selective modifier of the early microglial response, and cMet/HGFR blockade prevented the induction of microglial inflammatory mediators, of reactive microglia morphology and of TBI-associated responses in neurons, vessels and brain extracellular matrix. Acute or prolonged cMet/HGFR inhibition ameliorated neuronal survival and motor recovery. Early elevation of HGF itself in the CSF of TBI patients suggest that this mechanism has translational value in human subjects. Our findings identify cMet/HGFR as a modulator of early neuroinflammation in TBI with translational potential and indicate several RTK families as possible additional targets for TBI treatment.

                Animal models are widely used to study common stress-induced affective disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Here, we examine behavioral and brain transcriptomic (RNA-seq) responses in rat prolonged chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model, and their modulation by 4-week treatment with fluoxetine, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and their combinations. Overall, chronic stress produced anxiety-like phenotype, corrected by fluoxetine alone or in combination with EPA or LPS. EPA was anxiolytic in several tests, whereas LPS alone increased anxiety. PCUS evoked pronounced transcriptomic changes in rat hippocampi, differentially expressing >200 genes, while all pharmacological manipulations (except fluoxetine+EPA) affected only few genes. Gpr6, Drd2 and Adora2a were downregulated by chronic stress in a treatment-resistant manner, suggesting highly conserved nature of these pathogenetic genomic responses to chronic stress. Overall, these findings support the validity of rat PCUS paradigm as an effective tool to study stress-related pathologies, and calls for further research to probe how various conventional and novel drugs modulate behavioral and brain transcriptomic biomarkers of chronic stress in rodent models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vestibular Agnosia is linked to abnormal functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Activation of the peripheral vestibular apparatus simultaneously elicits a reflex vestibular nystagmus and the vestibular perception of self-motion (vestibular-motion perception) or vertigo. In a newly characterised condition called Vestibular Agnosia found in conditions with disrupted brain network connectivity, e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI) or neurodegeneration (Parkinson's Disease), the link between vestibular reflex and perception is uncoupled, such that, peripheral vestibular activation elicits a vestibular ocular reflex nystagmus but without vertigo. Using structural brain imaging in acute traumatic brain injury, we recently linked vestibular agnosia to postural imbalance via disrupted right temporal white-matter circuits (inferior longitudinal fasciculus), however no white-matter tracts were specifically linked to vestibular agnosia. Given the relative difficulty in localizing the neuroanatomical correlates of vestibular-motion perception, and compatible with current theories of human consciousness (viz. the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory), we postulate that vestibular-motion perception (vertigo) is mediated by the coordinated interplay between fronto-parietal circuits linked to whole-brain broadcasting of the vestibular signal of self-motion. We thus used resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to map functional brain networks and hence test our postulate of an anterior-posterior cortical network mediating vestibular agnosia. Whole-brain rsfMRI was acquired from 39 prospectively recruited acute TBI patients (and 37 matched controls) with preserved peripheral and reflex vestibular function, along with self-motion perceptual thresholds during passive yaw rotations in the dark, and posturography. Following quality control of the brain imaging, 25 TBI patients' images were analyzed. We classified 11 TBI patients with vestibular agnosia and 14 without vestibular agnosia based on laboratory testing of self-motion perception. Using independent component analysis, we found altered functional connectivity within posterior (right superior longitudinal fasciculus) and anterior networks (left rostral prefrontal cortex) in vestibular agnosia. Regions of interest analyses showed both inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric (left anterior-posterior) network disruption in vestibular agnosia. Assessing the brain regions linked via right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, a tract linked to vestibular agnosia in unbalanced patients (but now controlled for postural imbalance), seed-based analyses showed altered connectivity between higher order visual cortices involved in motion perception and mid-temporal regions. In conclusion, vestibular agnosia in our patient group is mediated by multiple brain network dysfunction, involving primarily left frontal and bilateral posterior networks. Understanding the brain mechanisms of vestibular agnosia provide both an insight into the physiological mechanisms of vestibular perception as well as an opportunity to diagnose and monitor vestibular cognitive deficits in brain disease such as TBI and neurodegeneration linked to imbalance and spatial disorientation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Effect of Spatial Frequency on the Visual Category Representation in the Macaque Inferior Temporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                To expand our knowledge about the object recognition, it is critical to understand the role of spatial frequency (SF) in an object representation that occurs in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex at the final stage of processing the visual information across the ventral visual pathway. Object categories are being recognized hierarchically in at least three levels of abstraction: superordinate (e.g., animal), mid-level (e.g., human face), and subordinate (e.g., face identity). Psychophysical studies have shown rapid access to mid-level category information and low SF (LSF) contents. Although the hierarchical representation of categories has been shown to exist inside the IT cortex, the impact of SF on the multi-level category processing is poorly understood. To gain a deeper understanding of the neural basis of the interaction between SF and category representations at multiple levels, we examined the neural responses within the IT cortex of macaque monkeys viewing several SF-filtered objects. Each stimulus could be either intact or bandpass filtered into either the LSF (coarse shape information) or high SF (HSF) (fine shape information) bands. We found that in both High- and Low- SF contents, the advantage of mid-level representation has not been violated. This evidence suggests that mid-level category boundary maps are strongly represented in the IT cortex and remain unaffected with respect to any changes in the frequency content of stimuli. Our observations indicate the necessity of the HSF content for the superordinate category representation inside the IT cortex. In addition, our findings reveal that the representation of global category information is more dependent on the HSF than the LSF content. Furthermore, the lack of subordinate representation in both LSF and HSF filtered stimuli compared to the intact stimuli provide strong evidence that all SF contents are necessary for fine category visual processing.

	<p>The interaction between the endocrine system and inflammation is crucial pathogenesis of depression. Our study aimed at exploring the possible relationship between sex hormones and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a common indicator of inflammation in male patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: GDF-15 levels of 121 male MDD patients were compared with 105 healthy subjects with the help of a Cobas 8000 automatic chemiluminescence immunoanalyzer. Results: (1) MDD patients showed higher GDF-15 levels, a lower testosterone (T) level and testosterone/estradiol ratio (T/E2 ratio) than healthy subjects (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). (2) Serum T levels and the T/E2 ratio were inversely associated with GDF-15 serum levels (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). (3) HAMD-24 scores were positively correlated with the levels of GDF-15 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but not with T levels, estradiol (E2) levels, and the T/E2 ratio (all p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The high level of GDF-15 was correlated with a low T/E2 ratio and T deficiency in male MDD patients. The above results demonstrate that up-regulation of serum GDF-15 and down-regulation of T and T/E2 ratio may be correlated with the occurrence and severity of depression. So, changing the level of GDF-15 by regulating the proportion of sex hormones may play a key role in the prognosis and treatment of depression.</p>

	<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rest-f-MRI) is a neuroimaging technique that has demonstrated its potential in providing new insights into brain physiology. rest-f-MRI can provide useful information in pre-surgical mapping aimed to balancing long-term survival by maximizing the extent of resection of brain neoplasms, while preserving the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional connectivity. Rest-fMRI may replace or can be complementary to task-driven fMRI (t-fMRI), particularly in patients unable to cooperate with the task paradigm, such as children or sedated, paretic, aphasic patients. Although rest-fMRI is still under standardization, this technique has been demonstrated to be feasible and valuable in the routine clinical setting for neurosurgical planning, along with intraoperative electrocortical mapping. In the literature, there is growing evidence that rest-fMRI can provide valuable information for the depiction of glioma-related functional brain network impairment. Accordingly, rest-fMRI could allow a tailored glioma surgery improving the surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to increase the extent of resection (EOR), and simultaneously minimize the risk of damage of eloquent brain structures and neuronal networks responsible for the integrity of executive functions. In this article, we present a review of the literature and illustrate the feasibility of rest-fMRI in the clinical setting for presurgical mapping of eloquent networks in patients affected by brain tumors, before and after tumor resection.</p>

                Parallel evolution can be expected among closely related taxa exposed to similar selective pressures. However, parallelism is typically stronger at the phenotypic level, while genetic solutions to achieve these phenotypic similarities may differ. For polygenic traits, the availability of standing genetic variation (i.e., heterozygosity) may influence such genetic nonparallelism. Here,...

                Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still a global health problem. COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia have a higher risk for critical illness, mostly complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The inflammatory response is critical, and the cytokine storm increases severity of COVID-19. Many factors could be associated with a cytokine storm but these are incompletely understood. The aim of this study is to present characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and explore the clinical and inflammatory parameters of severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted in all severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Peripheral blood was taken for laboratory examination within 24 hours of admission. Hematologic parameters, serum electrolyte, renal function, liver function, pancreas enzyme, D-dimer, inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in this study. Comparison analyses were done between sex, comorbidity existed, body mass index (BMI), and vaccination status. Results: A total of 80 subjects were included in the study. The most frequent comorbidities found among the subjects were obesity (36.35%) and diabetes (22.5%). Only 13.75% of subjects were vaccinated. Laboratory results indicated leukocytosis and neutrophilia, with neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) of 7. The mean inflammatory findings (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1), D-dimer, CRP, and lipase increased. Lipase levels were higher in men (p=0.003) and in comorbidity groups. No significant differences found with different BMI groups. Lipase, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher (p=0.019, <0.0001, and 0.03, respectively) in the non-vaccinated group. Conclusions: Most patients with severe COVID-19 have comorbidities and increased inflammatory markers.

                Background: Land use/land cover (LULC), change is one of the major contributors to global environmental and climate variations. The ability to predict future LULC is crucial for environmental engineers, civil engineers, urban designers, and natural resource managers for planning activities. Methods: TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modelling System in conjunction with ArcGIS Pro 2.8 were used to process LULC data for the region of the Lepelle River Basin (LRB) of South Africa. Driver variables such as population density, slope, elevation as well as the Euclidean distances of cities, roads, highways, railroads, parks and restricted areas, towns to the LRB in combination with LULC data were analysed using the Land Change Modeller (LCM) and Cellular-Automata Markov (CAM) model. Results: The results reveal an array of losses (-) and gains (+) for certain LULC classes in the LRB by the year 2040: natural vegetation (+8.5%), plantations (+3.5%), water bodies (-31.6%), bare ground (-8.8%), cultivated land (-29.3%), built-up areas (+10.6%) and mines (+14.4%). Conclusions: The results point to the conversion of land uses from natural to anthropogenic by 2040. These changes also highlight how the potential losses associated with resources such as water will negatively impact society and ecosystem functioning in the LRB by exacerbating water scarcity driven by climate change. This modelling study seeks to provides a decision support system for predicting future land resource utilization in the LRB and perhaps assist for planning purposes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Population variation in Y-chromosome microdeletion and its role in the evaluation of male infertility management: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Infertility has been a significantly growing problem worldwide, affecting approximately 10-15% of couples within reproductive age. Among the many causes of male infertility, Y-chromosome microdeletion is considered one of the most frequent genetic causes. Thus, this systematic review was constructed to determine the prevalence of Y-chromosome microdeletion and the population variations in the different types of Y-chromosome microdeletions. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scielo, and Science Direct databases to obtain articles that addressed the frequency of Y-chromosome microdeletion and male infertility. We identified 14 articles that originated from China, India, Iran, Brazil, Indonesia, North America, South Korea, and Slovakia, and the vital information collected included the year of publication, authors, number of patients with different types of Y-chromosome microdeletions, and the proportion of microdeletion in the major affected sub-regions of the Y-chromosome. Results: In this review, we attempted to highlight the variation in the frequency of Y-chromosome microdeletion in different geographical populations. The highest and lowest frequencies of Y-chromosome microdeletion were found in Indonesian (23.94%) and Slovakian (3.5%) populations, respectively. Conclusion: In conclusion, Y-chromosome microdeletion was undeniably found to be one of the leading genetic causes of male infertility. Azoospermic factor c (AZFc) microdeletion was the most frequent type of Y-chromosome microdeletion, typically presenting in patients with various clinical manifestations that ranged from oligozoospermia to azoospermia and exhibiting the highest chance for sperm retrieval. This review will undoubtedly help clinicians in providing a more accurate consultation to their patients and determining the success rates of assisted reproductive technology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Paradoxical relationship between speed and accuracy in olfactory figure-background segregation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lior Lebovich, Michael Yunerman, Viviana Scaiewicz, Yonatan Loewenstein, Dan Rokni</p>

In natural settings, many stimuli impinge on our sensory organs simultaneously. Parsing these sensory stimuli into perceptual objects is a fundamental task faced by all sensory systems. Similar to other sensory modalities, increased odor backgrounds decrease the detectability of target odors by the olfactory system. The mechanisms by which background odors interfere with the detection and identification of target odors are unknown. Here we utilized the framework of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to consider possible interference mechanisms in an odor detection task. We first considered pure effects of background odors on either signal or noise in the decision-making dynamics and showed that these produce different predictions about decision accuracy and speed. To test these predictions, we trained mice to detect target odors that are embedded in random background mixtures in a two-alternative choice task. In this task, the inter-trial interval was independent of behavioral reaction times to avoid motivating rapid responses. We found that increased backgrounds reduce mouse performance but paradoxically also decrease reaction times, suggesting that noise in the decision making process is increased by backgrounds. We further assessed the contributions of background effects on both noise and signal by fitting the DDM to the behavioral data. The models showed that background odors affect both the signal and the noise, but that the paradoxical relationship between trial difficulty and reaction time is caused by the added noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extracting multi-way chromatin contacts from Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Liu, Bokai Zhang, Changbong Hyeon</p>

There is a growing realization that multi-way chromatin contacts formed in chromosome structures are fundamental units of gene regulation. However, due to the paucity and complexity of such contacts, it is challenging to detect and identify them using experiments. Based on an assumption that chromosome structures can be mapped onto a network of Gaussian polymer, here we derive analytic expressions for <i>n</i>-body contact probabilities (<i>n</i> > 2) among chromatin loci based on pairwise genomic contact frequencies available in Hi-C, and show that multi-way contact probability maps can in principle be extracted from Hi-C. The three-body (triplet) contact probabilities, calculated from our theory, are in good correlation with those from measurements including Tri-C, MC-4C and SPRITE. Maps of multi-way chromatin contacts calculated from our analytic expressions can not only complement experimental measurements, but also can offer better understanding of the related issues, such as cell-line dependent assemblies of multiple genes and enhancers to chromatin hubs, competition between long-range and short-range multi-way contacts, and condensates of multiple CTCF anchors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In silico identification of potential calcium dynamics and sarcomere targets for recovering left ventricular function in rat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefano Longobardi, Anna Sher, Steven A. Niederer</p>

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex disease associated with multiple co-morbidities, where impaired cardiac mechanics are often the end effect. At the cellular level, cardiac mechanics can be pharmacologically manipulated by altering calcium signalling and the sarcomere. However, the link between cellular level modulations and whole organ pump function is incompletely understood. Our goal is to develop and use a multi-scale computational cardiac mechanics model of the obese ZSF1 HFpEF rat to identify important biomechanical mechanisms that underpin impaired cardiac function and to predict how whole-heart mechanical function can be recovered through altering cellular calcium dynamics and/or cellular contraction. The rat heart was modelled using a 3D biventricular biomechanics model. Biomechanics were described by 16 parameters, corresponding to intracellular calcium transient, sarcomere dynamics, cardiac tissue and hemodynamics properties. The model simulated left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops that were described by 14 scalar features. We trained a Gaussian process emulator to map the 16 input parameters to each of the 14 outputs. A global sensitivity analysis was performed, and identified calcium dynamics and thin and thick filament kinetics as key determinants of the organ scale pump function. We employed Bayesian history matching to build a model of the ZSF1 rat heart. Next, we recovered the LV function, described by ejection fraction, peak pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise and isovolumetric relaxation time constant. We found that by manipulating calcium, thin and thick filament properties we can recover 34%, 28% and 24% of the LV function in the ZSF1 rat heart, respectively, and 39% if we manipulate all of them together. We demonstrated how a combination of biophysically based models and their derived emulators can be used to identify potential pharmacological targets. We predicted that cardiac function can be best recovered in ZSF1 rats by desensitising the myofilament and reducing the affinity to intracellular calcium concentration and overall prolonging the sarcomere staying in the active force generating state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Engaging biological oscillators through second messenger pathways permits emergence of a robust gastric slow-wave during peristalsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Md Ashfaq Ahmed, Sharmila Venugopal, Ranu Jung</p>

Peristalsis, the coordinated contraction—relaxation of the muscles of the stomach is important for normal gastric motility and is impaired in motility disorders. Coordinated electrical depolarizations that originate and propagate within a network of interconnected layers of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and smooth muscle (SM) cells of the stomach wall as a slow-wave, underly peristalsis. Normally, the gastric slow-wave oscillates with a single period and uniform rostrocaudal lag, exhibiting network entrainment. Understanding of the integrative role of neurotransmission and intercellular coupling in the propagation of an entrained gastric slow-wave, important for understanding motility disorders, however, remains incomplete. Using a computational framework constituted of a novel gastric motility network (GMN) model we address the hypothesis that engaging biological oscillators (i.e., ICCs) by constitutive gap junction coupling mechanisms and enteric neural innervation activated signals can confer a robust entrained gastric slow-wave. We demonstrate that while a decreasing enteric neural innervation gradient that modulates the intracellular IP<sub>3</sub> concentration in the ICCs can guide the aboral slow-wave propagation essential for peristalsis, engaging ICCs by recruiting the exchange of second messengers (inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ensures a robust entrained longitudinal slow-wave, even in the presence of biological variability in electrical coupling strengths. Our GMN with the distinct intercellular coupling in conjunction with the intracellular feedback pathways and a rostrocaudal enteric neural innervation gradient allows gastric slow waves to oscillate with a moderate range of frequencies and to propagate with a broad range of velocities, thus preventing decoupling observed in motility disorders. Overall, the findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of decoupled slow waves associated with motility impairments of the stomach, offer directions for future experiments and theoretical work, and can potentially aid in the design of new interventional pharmacological and neuromodulation device treatments for addressing gastric motility disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergence and fragmentation of the alpha-band driven by neuronal network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lou Zonca, David Holcman</p>

Rhythmic neuronal network activity underlies brain oscillations. To investigate how connected neuronal networks contribute to the emergence of the <i>α</i>-band and to the regulation of Up and Down states, we study a model based on synaptic short-term depression-facilitation with afterhyperpolarization (AHP). We found that the <i>α</i>-band is generated by the network behavior near the attractor of the Up-state. Coupling inhibitory and excitatory networks by reciprocal connections leads to the emergence of a stable <i>α</i>-band during the Up states, as reflected in the spectrogram. To better characterize the emergence and stability of thalamocortical oscillations containing <i>α</i> and <i>δ</i> rhythms during anesthesia, we model the interaction of two excitatory networks with one inhibitory network, showing that this minimal topology underlies the generation of a persistent <i>α</i>-band in the neuronal voltage characterized by dominant Up over Down states. Finally, we show that the emergence of the <i>α</i>-band appears when external inputs are suppressed, while fragmentation occurs at small synaptic noise or with increasing inhibitory inputs. To conclude, <i>α</i>-oscillations could result from the synaptic dynamics of interacting excitatory neuronal networks with and without AHP, a principle that could apply to other rhythms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of whole genome duplications on the human gene regulatory networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Francesco Mottes, Chiara Villa, Matteo Osella, Michele Caselle</p>

This work studies the effects of the two rounds of Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) at the origin of the vertebrate lineage on the architecture of the human gene regulatory networks. We integrate information on transcriptional regulation, miRNA regulation, and protein-protein interactions to comparatively analyse the role of WGD and Small Scale Duplications (SSD) in the structural properties of the resulting multilayer network. We show that complex network motifs, such as combinations of feed-forward loops and bifan arrays, deriving from WGD events are specifically enriched in the network. Pairs of WGD-derived proteins display a strong tendency to interact both with each other and with common partners and WGD-derived transcription factors play a prominent role in the retention of a strong regulatory redundancy. Combinatorial regulation and synergy between different regulatory layers are in general enhanced by duplication events, but the two types of duplications contribute in different ways. Overall, our findings suggest that the two WGD events played a substantial role in increasing the multi-layer complexity of the vertebrate regulatory network by enhancing its combinatorial organization, with potential consequences on its overall robustness and ability to perform high-level functions like signal integration and noise control. Lastly, we discuss in detail the RAR/RXR pathway as an illustrative example of the evolutionary impact of WGD duplications in human.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autonomous epithelial folding induced by an intracellular mechano–polarity feedback loop</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fu-Lai Wen, Chun Wai Kwan, Yu-Chiun Wang, Tatsuo Shibata</p>

Epithelial tissues form folded structures during embryonic development and organogenesis. Whereas substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that induce folding, whether and how their interplay synergistically shapes epithelial folds remains poorly understood. Here we propose a mechano–biochemical model for dorsal fold formation in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, an epithelial folding event induced by shifts of cell polarity. Based on experimentally observed apical domain homeostasis, we couple cell mechanics to polarity and find that mechanical changes following the initial polarity shifts alter cell geometry, which in turn influences the reaction-diffusion of polarity proteins, thus forming a feedback loop between cell mechanics and polarity. This model can induce spontaneous fold formation <i>in silico</i>, recapitulate polarity and shape changes observed <i>in vivo</i>, and confer robustness to tissue shape change against small fluctuations in mechanics and polarity. These findings reveal emergent properties of a developing epithelium under control of intracellular mechano–polarity coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulations of dynamically cross-linked actin networks: Morphology, rheology, and hydrodynamic interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ondrej Maxian, Raúl P. Peláez, Alex Mogilner, Aleksandar Donev</p>

Cross-linked actin networks are the primary component of the cell cytoskeleton and have been the subject of numerous experimental and modeling studies. While these studies have demonstrated that the networks are viscoelastic materials, evolving from elastic solids on short timescales to viscous fluids on long ones, questions remain about the duration of each asymptotic regime, the role of the surrounding fluid, and the behavior of the networks on intermediate timescales. Here we perform detailed simulations of passively cross-linked non-Brownian actin networks to quantify the principal timescales involved in the elastoviscous behavior, study the role of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions, and parameterize continuum models from discrete stochastic simulations. To do this, we extend our recent computational framework for semiflexible filament suspensions, which is based on nonlocal slender body theory, to actin networks with dynamic cross linkers and finite filament lifetime. We introduce a model where the cross linkers are elastic springs with sticky ends stochastically binding to and unbinding from the elastic filaments, which randomly turn over at a characteristic rate. We show that, depending on the parameters, the network evolves to a steady state morphology that is either an isotropic actin mesh or a mesh with embedded actin bundles. For different degrees of bundling, we numerically apply small-amplitude oscillatory shear deformation to extract three timescales from networks of hundreds of filaments and cross linkers. We analyze the dependence of these timescales, which range from the order of hundredths of a second to the actin turnover time of several seconds, on the dynamic nature of the links, solvent viscosity, and filament bending stiffness. We show that the network is mostly elastic on the short time scale, with the elasticity coming mainly from the cross links, and viscous on the long time scale, with the effective viscosity originating primarily from stretching and breaking of the cross links. We show that the influence of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions depends on the network morphology: for homogeneous meshworks, nonlocal hydrodynamics gives only a small correction to the viscous behavior, but for bundled networks it both hinders the formation of bundles and significantly lowers the resistance to shear once bundles are formed. We use our results to construct three-timescale generalized Maxwell models of the networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine scale prediction of ecological community composition using a two-step sequential Machine Learning ensemble</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Icíar Civantos-Gómez, Javier García-Algarra, David García-Callejas, Javier Galeano, Oscar Godoy, Ignasi Bartomeus</p>

Prediction is one of the last frontiers in ecology. Indeed, predicting fine-scale species composition in natural systems is a complex challenge as multiple abiotic and biotic processes operate simultaneously to determine local species abundances. On the one hand, species intrinsic performance and their tolerance limits to different abiotic pressures modulate species abundances. On the other hand there is growing recognition that species interactions play an equally important role in limiting or promoting such abundances within ecological communities. Here, we present a joint effort between ecologists and data scientists to use data-driven models to predict species abundances using reasonably easy to obtain data. We propose a sequential data-driven modeling approach that in a first step predicts the potential species abundances based on abiotic variables, and in a second step uses these predictions to model the realized abundances once accounting for species competition. Using a curated data set over five years we predict fine-scale species abundances in a highly diverse annual plant community. Our models show a remarkable spatial predictive accuracy using only easy-to-measure variables in the field, yet such predictive power is lost when temporal dynamics are taken into account. This result suggests that predicting future abundances requires longer time series analysis to capture enough variability. In addition, we show that these data-driven models can also suggest how to improve mechanistic models by adding missing variables that affect species performance such as particular soil conditions (e.g. carbonate availability in our case). Robust models for predicting fine-scale species composition informed by the mechanistic understanding of the underlying abiotic and biotic processes can be a pivotal tool for conservation, especially given the human-induced rapid environmental changes we are experiencing. This objective can be achieved by promoting the knowledge gained with classic modelling approaches in ecology and recently developed data-driven models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Riddled with holes: Understanding air space formation in plant leaves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher D. Whitewoods</p>

Plants use energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide from the air into complex organic molecules, ultimately producing much of the food we eat. To make this complex chemistry more efficient, plant leaves are intricately constructed in 3 dimensions: They are flat to maximise light capture and contain extensive internal air spaces to increase gas exchange for photosynthesis. Many years of work has built up an understanding of how leaves form flat blades, but the molecular mechanisms that control air space formation are poorly understood. Here, I review our current understanding of air space formation and outline how recent advances can be harnessed to answer key questions and take the field forward. Increasing our understanding of plant air spaces will not only allow us to understand a fundamental aspect of plant development, but also unlock the potential to engineer the internal structure of crops to make them more efficient at photosynthesis with lower water requirements and more resilient in the face of a changing environment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Heterophilic and homophilic cadherin interactions in intestinal intermicrovillar links are species dependent</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle E. Gray, Zachary R. Johnson, Debadrita Modak, Elakkiya Tamilselvan, Matthew J. Tyska, Marcos Sotomayor</p>

Enterocytes are specialized epithelial cells lining the luminal surface of the small intestine that build densely packed arrays of microvilli known as brush borders. These microvilli drive nutrient absorption and are arranged in a hexagonal pattern maintained by intermicrovillar links formed by 2 nonclassical members of the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins: protocadherin-24 (PCDH24, also known as CDHR2) and the mucin-like protocadherin (CDHR5). The extracellular domains of these proteins are involved in heterophilic and homophilic interactions important for intermicrovillar function, yet the structural determinants of these interactions remain unresolved. Here, we present X-ray crystal structures of the PCDH24 and CDHR5 extracellular tips and analyze their species-specific features relevant for adhesive interactions. In parallel, we use binding assays to identify the PCDH24 and CDHR5 domains involved in both heterophilic and homophilic adhesion for human and mouse proteins. Our results suggest that homophilic and heterophilic interactions involving PCDH24 and CDHR5 are species dependent with unique and distinct minimal adhesive units.

                Background: Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is a well-established causal framework that is widely adopted in various domains and has a proven track record of success in research and application areas. However, BBN has weaknesses in causal knowledge elicitation and representation. The representation of the joint probability distribution in the Conditional Probability Table (CPT) has increased the complexity and difficulty for the user either in comprehending the causal knowledge or using it as a front-end modelling tool.   Methods: This study aims to propose a simplified version of the BBN ─ Bayesian causal model, which can represent the BBN intuitively and proposes an inference method based on the simplified version of BBN. The CPT in the BBN is replaced with the causal weight in the range of[-1,+1] to indicate the causal influence between the nodes. In addition, an inferential algorithm is proposed to compute and propagate the influence in the causal model.  Results: A case study is used to validate the proposed inferential algorithm. The results show that a Bayesian causal model is able to predict and diagnose the increment and decrement as in BBN.   Conclusions: The Bayesian causal model that serves as a simplified version of BBN has shown its advantages in modelling and representation, especially from the knowledge engineering perspective.

                Background: Exposure to 2.5-micron diameter air pollutants (PM2.5) has been associated with an increased risk of illness and death worldwide; however, in Latin American health impacts assessment of this risk factor is scarce. Medellín is one of the most polluted cities in the region, with a population growth rate that is twice as high as that of other Colombian cities, which implies a growing population at risk. Methods: A descriptive study of the disease burden was carried out using the city as the unit of observation. Health events were selected based on epidemiologic evidence and the availability of the population attributable fraction associated with PM2.5. The mortality records were taken from the module of deceased of the Single Registry of Affiliates of the Health System; the morbidity records were taken from the Individual Health Services Registries. For the estimation of the burden of disease, the current Global Burden of Disease guidelines were followed. Results: Attributable disability-adjusted life years to exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution (DALYsPM2.5) constituted 13.8% of total burden of the city. Males showed the greatest loss of DALYsPM2.5 due to acute events, while in women the greatest loss was due to chronic events. Ischemic heart disease, chronic diseases of the lower respiratory tract, and influenza and pneumonia were the events that contributed the most to DALYsPM2.5. 71.4% of the DALYsPM2.5 corresponded to mortality, mainly in the population over 65 years of age. Regarding attributable morbidity, acute events were more prevalent in both sexes, especially due to respiratory diseases Conclusion: Premature death among the elderly population has the greatest weight on burden of disease attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution, mainly due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, without significant differences according to gender.

Participants will be patients with acute traumatic peripheral nerve injury referred to the Hand Surgery Service of the General Hospital of the State of Bahia, a reference service in the state. These patients will undergo surgery followed by PES in the immediate postoperative period. After hospital discharge, they will be followed up on an outpatient basis by researchers, who will remotely supervise a physiotherapy program.

                Background: Shawarma, a popular meat-based fast food could be a source of foodborne outbreak due to non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). A clustering of acute gastrointestinal (GI) illness following intake of chicken shawarma occurred primarily among the staff and students of a tertiary care hospital in southern India. Methods: A case-control study was conducted among 348 undergraduate medical students (33 cases, 315 controls).  Data was collected using direct interviews and a simple online questionnaire. Epidemiological associations of GI illness were evaluated at three levels of exposure namely-eating food from any restaurant, eating food from the implicated food outlet, eating chicken shawarma from the implicated outlet. Results: Of 33 cases, 26 had consumed food from a particular food outlet, 4 from other outlets, and 3 did not report eating out. Consumption of food from the suspected food outlet was significantly associated with GI illness (odds ratio 121.8 [95% CI 28.41 to 522.66]; P<0.001); all the 26 cases who had eaten from the particular outlet had eaten chicken shawarma. By comparison, only one of the 315 controls had eaten this dish. Of the 27 persons (cases as well as controls) who had consumed chicken shawarma from the outlet, 26 were ill. Culture of stool samples from 10 affected individuals and implicated food item yielded Salmonella Enteritidis. Conclusions: Meat-based shawarma is a potential source of NTS infection. Food safety authorities should enforce guidelines for safe preparation and sale of shawarmas and similar products.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Flow cytometry of bone marrow aspirates from neuroblastoma patients is a highly sensitive technique for quantification of low-level neuroblastoma [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bone marrow involvement is an important aspect of determining staging of disease and treatment for childhood neuroblastoma. Current standard of care relies on microscopic examination of bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates respectively, to define involvement. Flow cytometric analysis of disaggregated tumour cells, when using a panel of neuroblastoma specific markers, allows for potentially less subjective determination of the presence of tumour cells. Methods: A retrospective review of sequential bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates, performed at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between the years 2015 and 2018, was performed to assess whether the addition of flow cytometric analysis to these standard of care methods provided concordant or additional information. Results: There was good concurrence between all three methods for negative results 216/302 (72%). Positive results had a concordance of 52/86 (61%), comparing samples positive by flow cytometry and positive by either or both cytology and histology.  Of the remaining samples, 20/86 (23%) were positive by either or both cytology and histology, but negative by flow cytometry. Whereas 14/86 (16%) of samples were positive only by flow cytometry. Conclusions: Our review highlights the ongoing importance of expert cytological and histological assessment of bone marrow results. Flow cytometry is an objective, quantitative method to assess the level of bone marrow disease in aspirates.  In this study, flow cytometry identified low-level residual disease that was not detected by cytology or histology. The clinical significance of this low-level disease warrants further investigation.

                Background and objective: Stroke is the second leading cause of death in Jordan and over the world. Knowledge and awareness towards stroke play a crucial role in the management and prevention of its complications. This study aims to assess the knowledge and awareness about stroke among the Jordanian population and determine factors associated with stroke awareness. Methods: This cross-sectional study through a web-based anonymous questionnaire that needed 10 minutes to be completed. It examined sociodemographic characteristics and recognition of the risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. Logistic regression analysis identified the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.  Results: A total of 573 Jordanian adults participated in this study. The participant's ability to identify at least one early symptom of stroke and the proper response to the symptoms were significantly correlated with the educational level (OR of 3.4 and 2.5, respectively). At least one consequence of stroke was significantly associated with different demographic factors such as gender, socioeconomic income, females versus males and those with medium income versus low income had significantly higher odds (OR of 6.6 and 4.1, respectively). Conclusion: This study revealed a good knowledge and awareness level about stroke among Jordanians correlated mainly with their educational level. Therefore, new strategies should be considered to decrease the prevalence of stroke in Jordan, including the need for engagement in enhanced awareness campaigns.

                NeuroD1-induced cross-lineage microglia-to-neuron conversion is hotly debated. Rao et al. demonstrate that NeuroD1 does not induce microglia-to-neuron conversion in mice. Instead, NeuroD1 triggers microglial apoptosis. Rao et al. further propose generic principles for verifying glia-to-neuron conversion.

                Wratil et al. find specific antibody responses against seasonal human coronaviruses, which cause the common cold, to be elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic blood donors. This specific immunity is likely pre-existing in patients and increases their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19.
