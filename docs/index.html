<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ<sub class="a-plus-plus">1-40/42</sub> in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup>; irradiation area, 4.5 cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup>; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> × 4.5 cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> × 440 s). About 100 μM H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub>0<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in <span class="a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7">Morris water maze</span>. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ<sub class="a-plus-plus">25–35</sub>-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.</p>

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages in latency and energy
efficiency over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to its
event-driven computation mechanism and replacement of energy-consuming weight
multiplications with additions. However, in order to reach accuracy of its ANN
counterpart, it usually requires long spike trains to ensure the accuracy.
Traditionally, a spike train needs around one thousand time steps to approach
similar accuracy as its ANN counterpart. This offsets the computation
efficiency brought by SNNs because longer spike trains mean a larger number of
operations and longer latency. In this paper, we propose a radix encoded SNN
with ultra-short spike trains. In the new model, the spike train takes less
than ten time steps. Experiments show that our method demonstrates 25X speedup
and 1.1% increment on accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art work on
VGG-16 network architecture and CIFAR-10 dataset.

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) communicate through the all-or-none spiking
activity of neurons. However, fitting the large number of SNN model parameters
to observed neural activity patterns, for example, in biological experiments,
remains a challenge. Previous work using genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation on
a specific efficient SNN model, using the Izhikevich neuronal model, was
limited to a single parameter and objective. This work applied a version of GA,
called non-dominated sorting GA (NSGA-III), to demonstrate the feasibility of
performing multi-objective optimisation on the same SNN, focusing on searching
network connectivity parameters to achieve target firing rates of excitatory
and inhibitory neuronal types, including across different network connectivity
sparsity. We showed that NSGA-III could readily optimise for various firing
rates. Notably, when the excitatory neural firing rates were higher than or
equal to that of inhibitory neurons, the errors were small. Moreover, when
connectivity sparsity was considered as a parameter to be optimised, the
optimal solutions required sparse network connectivity. We also found that for
excitatory neural firing rates lower than that of inhibitory neurons, the
errors were generally larger. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the
feasibility of implementing multi-objective GA optimisation on network
parameters of recurrent and sparse SNN.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06757">Quantifying the Impact of Boundary Constraint Handling Methods on Differential Evolution. (arXiv:2105.06757v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Constraint handling is one of the most influential aspects of applying
metaheuristics to real-world applications, which can hamper the search progress
if treated improperly. In this work, we focus on a particular case - the box
constraints, for which many boundary constraint handling methods (BCHMs) have
been proposed. We call for the necessity of studying the impact of BCHMs on
metaheuristics' performance and behavior, which receives seemingly little
attention in the field. We target quantifying such impacts through systematic
benchmarking by investigating 28 major variants of Differential Evolution (DE)
taken from the modular DE framework (by combining different mutation and
crossover operators) and $13$ commonly applied BCHMs, resulting in $28 \times
13 = 364$ algorithm instances after pairing DE variants with BCHMs. After
executing the algorithm instances on the well-known BBOB/COCO problem set, we
analyze the best-reached objective function value (performance-wise) and the
percentage of repaired solutions (behavioral) using statistical ranking methods
for each combination of mutation, crossover, and BBOB function group. Our
results clearly show that the choice of BCHMs substantially affects the
empirical performance as well as the number of generated infeasible solutions,
which allows us to provide general guidelines for selecting an appropriate BCHM
for a given scenario.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06727">Verification of Size Invariance in DNN Activations using Concept Embeddings. (arXiv:2105.06727v1 [cs.CV])</a></h4>

<p>The benefits of deep neural networks (DNNs) have become of interest for
safety critical applications like medical ones or automated driving. Here,
however, quantitative insights into the DNN inner representations are
mandatory. One approach to this is concept analysis, which aims to establish a
mapping between the internal representation of a DNN and intuitive semantic
concepts. Such can be sub-objects like human body parts that are valuable for
validation of pedestrian detection. To our knowledge, concept analysis has not
yet been applied to large object detectors, specifically not for sub-parts.
Therefore, this work first suggests a substantially improved version of the
Net2Vec approach (<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1801.03454">arXiv:1801.03454</a>) for post-hoc segmentation of sub-objects.
Its practical applicability is then demonstrated on a new concept dataset by
two exemplary assessments of three standard networks, including the larger Mask
R-CNN model (<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870">arXiv:1703.06870</a>): (1) the consistency of body part similarity,
and (2) the invariance of internal representations of body parts with respect
to the size in pixels of the depicted person. The findings show that the
representation of body parts is mostly size invariant, which may suggest an
early intelligent fusion of information in different size categories.

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are the so-called third generation of neural
networks which attempt to more closely match the functioning of the biological
brain. They inherently encode temporal data, allowing for training with less
energy usage and can be extremely energy efficient when coded on neuromorphic
hardware. In addition, they are well suited for tasks involving event-based
sensors, which match the event-based nature of the SNN. However, SNNs have not
been as effectively applied to real-world, large-scale tasks as standard
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the algorithmic and training
complexity. To exacerbate the situation further, the input representation is
unconventional and requires careful analysis and deep understanding. In this
paper, we propose \textit{SpikeMS}, the first deep encoder-decoder SNN
architecture for the real-world large-scale problem of motion segmentation
using the event-based DVS camera as input. To accomplish this, we introduce a
novel spatio-temporal loss formulation that includes both spike counts and
classification labels in conjunction with the use of new techniques for SNN
backpropagation. In addition, we show that \textit{SpikeMS} is capable of
\textit{incremental predictions}, or predictions from smaller amounts of test
data than it is trained on. This is invaluable for providing outputs even with
partial input data for low-latency applications and those requiring fast
predictions. We evaluated \textit{SpikeMS} on challenging synthetic and
real-world sequences from EV-IMO, EED and MOD datasets and achieving results on
a par with a comparable ANN method, but using potentially 50 times less power.

<p>Today, state-of-the-art Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods cannot scale
to many hardware platforms or scenarios at a low training costs and/or can only
handle non-diverse, heavily constrained architectural search-spaces. To solve
these issues, we present DONNA (Distilling Optimal Neural Network
Architectures), a novel pipeline for rapid and diverse NAS, that scales to many
user scenarios. In DONNA, a search consists of three phases. First, an accuracy
predictor is built using blockwise knowledge distillation. This predictor
enables searching across diverse networks with varying macro-architectural
parameters such as layer types and attention mechanisms as well as across
micro-architectural parameters such as block repeats and expansion rates.
Second, a rapid evolutionary search phase finds a set of Pareto-optimal
architectures for any scenario using the accuracy predictor and on-device
measurements. Third, optimal models are quickly finetuned to
training-from-scratch accuracy. With this approach, DONNA is up to 100x faster
than MNasNet in finding state-of-the-art architectures on-device. Classifying
ImageNet, DONNA architectures are 20% faster than EfficientNet-B0 and
MobileNetV2 on a Nvidia V100 GPU and 10% faster with 0.5% higher accuracy than
MobileNetV2-1.4x on a Samsung S20 smartphone. In addition to NAS, DONNA is used
for search-space extension and exploration, as well as hardware-aware model
compression.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678510">Cannabinoid Signaling in Auditory Function and Development</a></h4>

<p>Plants of the genus Cannabis have been used by humans for millennia for a variety of purposes. Perhaps most notable is the use of certain Cannabis strains for their psychoactive effects. More recently, several biologically active molecules within the plants of these Cannabis strains, called phytocannabinoids or simply cannabinoids, have been identified. Furthermore, within human cells, endogenous cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids, as well as the receptors and secondary messengers that give rise to their neuromodulatory effects, have also been characterized. This endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of two primary ligands—anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol; two primary receptors—cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2; and several enzymes involved in biosynthesis and degradation of endocannabinoid ligands including diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Here we briefly summarize cannabinoid signaling and review what has been discerned to date with regard to cannabinoid signaling in the auditory system and its roles in normal physiological function as well as pathological conditions. While much has been uncovered regarding cannabinoid signaling in the central nervous system, less attention has been paid to the auditory system specifically. Still, evidence is emerging to suggest that cannabinoid signaling is critical for the development, maturation, function, and survival of cochlear hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Furthermore, cannabinoid signaling can have profound effects on synaptic connectivity in CNS structures related to auditory processing. While clinical cases demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids impact auditory function, this review highlights several areas, such as SGN development, where more research is warranted.</p>

<p>As a typical neuropathic pain, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster (HZ), which seriously affects the normal life and work of patients. The unclear pathogenesis and lack of effective drugs make the clinical efficacy of PHN unsatisfactory. Here, we obtained the transcriptome profile of neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and DRG in rats infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with publicly available gene array data sets. Next, the data processing of the transcriptome map was analyzed using bioinformatics methods, including the screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Finally, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of calcium-related genes, and calcium fluorescent probes and calcium colorimetry were used to evaluate the distribution and content of calcium ions in cells after VZV infection. Transcriptome data analysis (GO and KEGG enrichment analysis) showed that calcium disorder played an important role in SH-SY5Y cells infected by VZV and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the PHN rat model. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of calcium-related genes BHLHA15, CACNA1F, CACNG1, CHRNA9, and STC2 were significantly upregulated, while the expression levels of CHRNA10, HRC, and TNNT3 were significantly downregulated in SH-SY5Y cells infected with VZV. Our calcium fluorescent probe and calcium colorimetric test results showed that VZV could change the distribution of calcium ions in infected cells and significantly increase the intracellular calcium content. In conclusion, our results revealed that the persistence of calcium disorder caused by VZV in nerve cells might be a crucial cause of herpetic neuralgia, and a potential target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of PHN.</p>

<p>Rats have been widely used as an experimental organism in psychological, pharmacological, and behavioral studies by modeling human diseases such as neurological disorders. It is critical to identify and characterize cell fate determinants and their regulatory mechanisms in single-cell resolutions across rat brain regions. Here, we applied droplet-based single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) to systematically profile the single-cell chromatin accessibility across four dissected brain areas in adult Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats with a total of 59,023 single nuclei and identified 16 distinct cell types. Interestingly, we found that different cortex regions exhibit diversity in both cellular compositions and gene regulatory regions. Several cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs), including SPI1, KLF4, KLF6, and NEUROD2, have been shown to play important roles during the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), astrocytic gliomas, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, our single-nucleus atlas of rat cortex could serve as an invaluable resource for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse cortex cell fates and further revealing the regulatory networks of neuropathogenesis.</p>

<p>Photoacoustic (PA, or optoacoustic, OA) mesoscopy is a powerful tool for mouse cerebral imaging, which offers high resolution three-dimensional (3D) images with optical absorption contrast inside the optically turbid brain. The image quality of a PA mesoscope relies on the ultrasonic transducer which detects the PA signals. An all-optical ultrasound sensor based on a Fabry-Pérot (FP) polymer cavity has the following advantages: broadband frequency response, wide angular coverage and small footprint. Here, we present 3D PA mesoscope for mouse brain imaging using such an optical sensor. A heating laser was used to stabilize the sensor’s cavity length during the imaging process. To acquire data for a 3D angiogram of the mouse brain, the sensor was mounted on a translation stage and raster scanned. 3D images of the mouse brain vasculature were reconstructed which showed cerebrovascular structure up to a depth of 8 mm with high quality. Imaging segmentation and dual wavelength imaging were performed to demonstrate the potential of the system in preclinical brain research.</p>

Objective<p>Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a minimum-invasive surgical approach to non-incisionally cause the thermos-coagulation inside the human brain. The skull score (SS) has already been approved as one of the most dominant factors related to a successful MRgFUS treatment. In this study, we first reveal the SS distribution of the tremor patients, and correlate the SS with the image feature from customized skull density ratio (cSDR). This correlation might give a direction to future clinical studies for improving the SS.</p>Methods<p>Two hundred and forty-six patients received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, and a bone-enhanced filter was applied and reconstructed to a high spatial resolution CT images. The SS of all patients would be estimated by the MRgFUS system after importing the reconstructed CT images into the MRgFUS system. The histogram and the cumulative distribution of the SS from all the patients were calculated to show the percentage of the patients whose SS lower than 0.3 and 0.4. The same CT images of all patients were utilized to calculated the cSDR by first segmented the trabecular bone and the cortical bone from the CT images and divided the average trabecular bone intensity (aTBI) by the average cortical bone intensity (aCBI). The Pearson’s correlations between the SS and the cSDR, aTBI, and the aCBI were calculated, respectively.</p>Results<p>There were 19.19 and 50% of the patient who had the SS lower than the empirical threshold 0.3 and 0.4, respectively. The Pearson’s correlation between the SS and the cSDR, aCBI, and the aTBI were R = 0.8145, 0.5723, and 0.8842.</p>Conclusion<p>Half of the patients were eligible for the MRgFUS thalamotomy based on the SS, and nearly 20% of patients were empirically difficult to achieve a therapeutic temperature during MRgFUS. The SS and our cSDR are highly correlated, and the SS had a higher correlation with aTBI than with aCBI. This is the first report to explicitly reveal the SS population and indicate a potential way to increase the chance to achieve a therapeutic temperature for those who originally have low SS.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.554229">A Probabilistic Atlas of the Pineal Gland in the Standard Space</a></h4>

<p>Pineal gland (PG) is a structure located in the midline of the brain, and is considered as a main part of the epithalamus. There are numerous reports on the facilitatory role of this area for brain function; hormone secretion and its role in sleep cycle are the major reports. However, reports are rarely available on the direct role of this structure in brain cognition and in information processing. A suggestion for the limited number of such studies is the lack of a standard atlas for the PG; none of the available MRI templates and atlases has provided parcellations for this structure. In this study, we used the three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted MRI data of 152 healthy young volunteers, and provided a probabilistic map of the PG in the standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. The methods included collecting the data using a 64-channel head coil on a 3-Tesla Prisma MRI Scanner, manual delineation of the PG by two experts, and robust template and atlas construction algorithms. This atlas is freely accessible, and we hope importing this atlas in the well-known neuroimaging software packages would help to identify other probable roles of the PG in brain function. It could also be used to study pineal cysts, for volumetric analyses, and to test any associations between the cognitive abilities of the human and the structure of the PG.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660470">Idiosyncratic Characteristics of Postural Sway in Normal and Perturbed Standing</a></h4>

Objective<p>Are people with a characteristically large physiological sway rendered particularly unstable when standing on a moving surface? Is postural sway in standing individuals idiosyncratic? In this study, we examine postural sway in individuals standing normally, and when subtle continuous sinusoidal disturbances are applied to their support platform. We calculate consistency between conditions to verify if sway can be considered characteristic of each individual. We also correlate two different aspects of participants’ responses to disturbance; their sway velocity and their regulation of body orientation.</p>Methods<p>Nineteen healthy adults (age 29.2 ± 3.2 years) stood freely on footplates coaxially aligned with their ankles and attached to a motorized platform. They had their eyes closed, and hips and knees locked with a light wooden board attached to their body. Participants either stood quietly on a fixed platform or on a slowly tilting platform (0.1 Hz sinusoid; 0.2 and 0.4 deg). Postural sway size was separated into two entities: (1) the spontaneous sway velocity component (natural random relatively rapid postural adjustments, RMS body angular velocity) and (2) the evoked tilt gain component (much slower 0.1 Hz synchronous tilt induced by the movement of the platform, measured as peak-to-peak (p-p) gain, ratio of body angle to applied footplate rotation).</p>Results<p>There was no correlation between the velocity of an individual’s sway and their evoked tilt gain (r = 0.34, p = 0.15 and r = 0.30, p = 0.22). However, when considered separately, each of the two measurements showed fair to good absolute agreement within conditions. Spontaneous sway velocity consistently increased as participants were subjected to increasing disturbance. Participants who swayed more (or less) did so across all conditions [ICC<sub>(3,k)</sub> = 0.95]. Evoked tilt gain also showed consistency between conditions [ICC<sub>(3,k)</sub> = 0.79], but decreased from least to most disturbed conditions.</p>Conclusion<p>The two measurements remain consistent between conditions. Consistency between conditions of two very distinct unrelated measurements reflects the idiosyncratic nature of postural sway. However, sway velocity and tilt gain are not related, which supports the idea that the short-term regulation of stability and the longer-term regulation of orientation are controlled by different processes.</p>

<p>This review article summarizes various functions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that are related to language processing. To this end, its connectivity with the left-dominant perisylvian language network was considered, as well as its interaction with other functional networks that, directly or indirectly, contribute to language processing. Language-related functions of the DLPFC comprise various aspects of pragmatic processing such as discourse management, integration of prosody, interpretation of nonliteral meanings, inference making, ambiguity resolution, and error repair. Neurophysiologically, the DLPFC seems to be a key region for implementing functional connectivity between the language network and other functional networks, including cortico-cortical as well as subcortical circuits. Considering clinical aspects, damage to the DLPFC causes psychiatric communication deficits rather than typical aphasic language syndromes. Although the number of well-controlled studies on DLPFC language functions is still limited, the DLPFC might be an important target region for the treatment of pragmatic language disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617669">Indirect Vibration of the Upper Limbs Alters Transmission Along Spinal but Not Corticospinal Pathways</a></h4>

<p>The use of upper limb vibration (ULV) during exercise and rehabilitation continues to gain popularity as a modality to improve function and performance. Currently, a lack of knowledge of the pathways being altered during ULV limits its effective implementation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether indirect ULV modulates transmission along spinal and corticospinal pathways that control the human forearm. All measures were assessed under CONTROL (no vibration) and ULV (30 Hz; 0.4 mm displacement) conditions while participants maintained a small contraction of the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. To assess spinal pathways, Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) elicited by stimulation of the median nerve were recorded from FCR with motor response (M-wave) amplitudes matched between conditions. An H-reflex conditioning paradigm was also used to assess changes in presynaptic inhibition by stimulating the superficial radial (SR) nerve (5 pulses at 300Hz) 37 ms prior to median nerve stimulation. Cutaneous reflexes in FCR elicited by stimulation of the SR nerve at the wrist were also recorded. To assess corticospinal pathways, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex were recorded from the right FCR and biceps brachii (BB). ULV significantly reduced H-reflex amplitude by 15.7% for both conditioned and unconditioned reflexes (24.0 ± 15.7 vs. 18.4 ± 11.2% M<sub>max</sub>; p &lt; 0.05). Middle latency cutaneous reflexes were also significantly reduced by 20.0% from CONTROL (−1.50 ± 2.1% Mmax) to ULV (−1.73 ± 2.2% Mmax; p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant effect of ULV on MEP amplitude (p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, ULV inhibits cutaneous and H-reflex transmission without influencing corticospinal excitability of the forearm flexors suggesting increased presynaptic inhibition of afferent transmission as a likely mechanism. A general increase in inhibition of spinal pathways with ULV may have important implications for improving rehabilitation for individuals with spasticity (SCI, stroke, MS, etc.).</p>

<p>Equilibrium propagation is a learning framework that marks a step forward in the search for a biologically-plausible implementation of deep learning, and could be implemented efficiently in neuromorphic hardware. Previous applications of this framework to layered networks encountered a vanishing gradient problem that has not yet been solved in a simple, biologically-plausible way. In this paper, we demonstrate that the vanishing gradient problem can be mitigated by replacing some of a layered network's connections with random layer-skipping connections in a manner inspired by small-world networks. This approach would be convenient to implement in neuromorphic hardware, and is biologically-plausible.</p>

<p>Dopamine is an important chemical messenger in the brain, which modulates movement, reward, motivation, and memory. Different populations of neurons can produce and release dopamine in the brain and regulate different behaviors. Here we focus our discussion on a small but distinct group of dopamine-producing neurons, which display the most profound loss in the ventral substantia nigra pas compacta of patients with Parkinson’s disease. This group of dopaminergic neurons can be readily identified by a selective expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and accounts for 70% of total nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both human and mouse brains. Recently, we presented the first whole-brain circuit map of these ALDH1A1-positive dopaminergic neurons and reveal an essential physiological function of these neurons in regulating the vigor of movement during the acquisition of motor skills. In this review, we first summarize previous findings of ALDH1A1-positive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and their connectivity and functionality, and then provide perspectives on how the activity of ALDH1A1-positive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is regulated through integrating diverse presynaptic inputs and its implications for potential Parkinson’s disease treatment.</p>

Background<p>Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is common after acute ischemic stroke and adversely affects the quality of life. SCI is associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

<p>Cerebrovascular dysfunction and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular damage to cerebrovessels in AD may result in alterations in vascular clearance mechanisms leading to amyloid deposition around blood vessels and diminished neurovascular-coupling. The sequelae of molecular events leading to these early pathogenic changes remains elusive. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive in-depth molecular characterization of the proteomic changes in enriched cerebrovessel fractions isolated from the inferior frontal gyrus of autopsy AD cases with low (85.5 ± 2.9 yrs) vs. high (81 ± 4.4 yrs) CAA score, aged-matched control (87.4 ± 1.5 yrs) and young healthy control (47 ± 3.3 yrs) cases. We employed a 10-plex tandem isobaric mass tag approach in combination with our ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography MS/MS (Q-Exactive) method. Enriched cerebrovascular fractions showed very high expression levels of proteins specific to endothelial cells, mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells), and astrocytes. We observed 150 significantly regulated proteins in young vs. aged control cerebrovessels. The top pathways significantly modulated with aging included chemokine, reelin, HIF1α and synaptogenesis signaling pathways. There were 213 proteins significantly regulated in aged-matched control vs. high CAA cerebrovessels. The top three pathways significantly altered from this comparison were oxidative phosphorylation, Sirtuin signaling pathway and TCA cycle II. Comparison between low vs. high CAA cerebrovessels identified 84 significantly regulated proteins. Top three pathways significantly altered between low vs. high CAA cerebrovessels included TCA Cycle II, Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, high CAA cases included more advanced AD pathology thus cerebrovascular effects may be driven by the severity of amyloid and Tangle pathology. These descriptive proteomic changes provide novel insights to explain the age-related and AD-related cerebrovascular changes contributing to AD pathogenesis. Particularly, disturbances in energy bioenergetics and mitochondrial biology rank among the top AD pathways altered in cerebrovessels. Targeting these failed mechanisms in endothelia and mural cells may provide novel disease modifying targets for developing therapeutic strategies against cerebrovascular deterioration and promoting cerebral perfusion in AD. Our future work will focus on interrogating and validating these novel targets and pathways and their functional significance.</p>

The crystal structure of the light-gated anion channel <i>Gt</i>ACR1 reported in our previous Research Article (<i>Li et al., 2019</i>) revealed a continuous tunnel traversing the protein from extracellular to intracellular pores. We proposed the tunnel as the conductance channel closed by three constrictions: C1 in the extracellular half, mid-membrane C2 containing the photoactive site, and C3 on the cytoplasmic side. Reported here, the crystal structure of bromide-bound <i>Gt</i>ACR1 reveals structural changes that relax the C1 and C3 constrictions, including a novel salt-bridge switch mechanism involving C1 and the photoactive site. These findings indicate that substrate binding induces a transition from an inactivated state to a pre-activated state in the dark that facilitates channel opening by reducing free energy in the tunnel constrictions. The results provide direct evidence that the tunnel is the closed form of the channel of <i>Gt</i>ACR1 and shed light on the light-gated channel activation mechanism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63798">Clustered functional domains for curves and corners in cortical area V4</a></h4>

The ventral visual pathway is crucially involved in integrating low-level visual features into complex representations for objects and scenes. At an intermediate stage of the ventral visual pathway, V4 plays a crucial role in supporting this transformation. Many V4 neurons are selective for shape segments like curves and corners, however it remains unclear whether these neurons are organized into clustered functional domains, a structural motif common across other visual cortices. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake macaques, we confirmed and localized cortical domains selective for curves or corners in V4. Single-cell resolution imaging confirmed that curve or corner selective neurons were spatially clustered into such domains. When tested with hexagonal-segment stimuli, we find that stimulus smoothness is the cardinal difference between curve and corner selectivity in V4. Combining cortical population responses with single neuron analysis, our results reveal that curves and corners are encoded by neurons clustered into functional domains in V4. This functionally-specific population architecture bridges the gap between the early and late cortices of the ventral pathway and may serve to facilitate complex object recognition.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26101?af=R">Characterization of extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement and its rapidly progressive subtype</a></h4>

Objective
To characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study we included 31 patients with systemic GCA with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 (69.2%) patients with and in 16 (100%) without intracranial involvement (P = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 (50.0%) patients with and 13 (76.5%) patients without intracranial involvement (P = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 (54.8%) and both territories in 12 (38.7%) patients. Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 (37.9%) patients had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median mRS at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (IQR 2.0–6.0) and 4 (36.4%) patients died. Vessel wall expression of IL6 and IL17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL17 and IL6 may represent potential future treatment targets.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Detection of looming obstacles is a vital task for both natural and artificial systems. Locusts possess a visual nervous system with an extensively studied obstacle detection pathway, culminating in the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron. While numerous models of this system exist, none to date have incorporated recent data on the anatomy and function of feedforward and global inhibitory systems in the input network of the LGMD. Moreover, the possibility that global and lateral inhibition shape the feedforward inhibitory signals to the LGMD has not been investigated. To address these points, a novel model of feedforward inhibitory neurons in the locust optic lobe was developed based on the recent literature. This model also incorporated global and lateral inhibition into the afferent network of these neurons, based on their observed behaviour in existing data and the posited role of these mechanisms in the inputs to the LGMD. Tests with the model showed that it accurately replicates the behaviour of feedforward inhibitory neurons in locusts; the model accurately coded for stimulus angular size in an overall linear fashion, with decreasing response saturation and increasing linearity as stimulus size increased or approach velocity decreased. The model also exhibited only phasic responses to the appearance of a grating, along with sustained movement by it at constant speed. By observing the effects of altering inhibition schemes on these responses, it was determined that global inhibition serves primarily to normalize growing excitation as collision approaches, and keeps coding for subtense angle linear. Lateral inhibition was determined to suppress tonic responses to wide-field stimuli translating at constant speed. Based on these features being shared with characterizations of the LGMD input network, it was hypothesized that the feedforward inhibitory neurons and the LGMD share the same excitatory afferents; this necessitates further investigation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Focus of attention (FOA) has been shown to affect human motor performance. Research into FOA has mainly posited it as either external or internal to-the-body (EFOA and IFOA, respectively). However, this binary paradigm overlooks the dynamic interactions among the individual, the task, and the environment, which are core to many disciplines, including dance. This paper reviews the comparative effects of EFOA and IFOA on human motor performance. Next, it identifies challenges within this EFOA–IFOA binary paradigm at the conceptual, definitional, and functional levels, which could lead to misinterpretation of research findings thus impeding current understanding of FOA. Building on these challenges and in effort to expand the current paradigm into a non-binary one, it offers an additional FOA category—dynamic interactive FOA—which highlights the dynamic interactions existing between EFOA and IFOA. Mental imagery is then proposed as a suitable approach for separately studying the different FOA subtypes. Lastly, clinical and research applications of a dynamic interactive FOA perspective for a wide range of domains, from motor rehabilitation to sports and dance performance enhancement, are discussed.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.15.444029v1?rss=1">Evidence of wiring development processes from the connectome of adult Drosophila</a></h4>

How is the brain wired during development? Here we look at some of the characteristics of the adult Drosophila brain, a result of this development process. From this we can speculate on at least some aspects of how the wiring was done. A common hypothesis is that surface proteins direct synapse formation among touching neurons. Assuming that surface proteins are specific to cell types, we find support for this hypothesis. The brain in general supports a wide variety of connections of different degrees of reciprocity, with ratios up to a thousand to one in the two directions of synapses between types. However, contacts between cells of the same type are always bi-directional and nearly equal strength. Furthermore, among similar cell types, at least in the mushroom body, the closer the cell type by morphology, the closer the inter-type contacts are to symmetrical. These findings are all consistent with the hypothesis that surface proteins specific to cell types determine the directivity of connections. Next we look at synapses per area, and find this varies widely and is roughly log-normally distributed. In most cases, the number of synapses saturates at higher areas, though other forms are seen - linear, flat, or decreasing with increasing area. Evidence suggests that at least some of this distinction is post-synaptic.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.14.444151v1?rss=1">Nitric oxide signalling underlies salicylate-induced increases in neuronal firing in the inferior colliculus: a central mechanism of tinnitus?</a></h4>

The tinnitus-inducing agent salicylate reduces cochlear output but causes hyperactivity in higher auditory centres, including the inferior colliculus (the auditory midbrain). Using multi-electrode recording in anaesthetised guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), we addressed the hypothesis that salicylate-induced hyperactivity in the inferior colliculus involves nitric oxide signalling secondary to increased ascending excitatory input. In the inferior colliculus, systemic salicylate (200 mg/kg i.p., 0 h) markedly increased spontaneous and sound-driven neuronal firing (3-6 h post drug) with both onset and sustained responses to pure tones being massively increased. Reverse microdialysis of increasing concentrations of salicylate directly into the inferior colliculus (100 M-10 mM, from 0 h) failed to mimic systemic salicylate. In contrast, it caused a small, transient, increase in sound-driven firing (1 h), followed by a larger sustained decrease in both spontaneous and sound-driven firing (2-5 h). When salicylate was given systemically, reverse microdialysis of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-methyl arginine into the inferior colliculus (500 mM, 2-6 h) completely blocked the salicylate-induced increase in spontaneous and sound-driven neuronal firing. Our data indicate that systemic salicylate induces neuronal hyperactivity in the auditory midbrain via a mechanism outside the inferior colliculus, presumably upstream in the auditory pathway; and that the mechanism is ultimately dependent on nitric oxide signalling within the inferior colliculus. Given that nitric oxide is known to mediate NMDA receptor signalling in the inferior colliculus, we propose that salicylate activates an ascending glutamatergic input to the inferior colliculus and that this is an important mechanism underlying salicylate-induced tinnitus.

Calcium imaging using genetically encoded indicators (GECIs) is a widely adopted method to measure neural activity in modern neuroscience. Here, we explore the use of systemically administered viral vectors for brain-wide expression of GECIs, and adapt novel GECIs to optimize signal-to-noise. We show that systemic injections of PHP.eb AAVs to express GECIs is a highly promising technique for imaging neural activity and circumvent the need for transgenic GECI expressing mouse lines. We also establish the use of novel soma-targeted GECIs that outperform current Ca2+ indicators using both systemic and local virus injections.

Converging evidence suggests that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may entrain endogenous neural oscillations to match the frequency and phase of the exogenously applied current and this entrainment may outlast the stimulation (although only for a few oscillatory cycles following the cessation of stimulation). However, observing entrainment in the electroencephalograph (EEG) during stimulation is extremely difficult due to the presence of complex tACS artefacts. The present study assessed entrainment to slow oscillatory (SO) tACS by measuring motor cortical excitability across different oscillatory phases during (i.e., online) and outlasting (i.e., offline) stimulation. 30 healthy participants received 60 trials of intermittent SO tACS (0.75 Hz; 16s on / off interleaved) at an intensity of 2mA peak-to-peak. Motor cortical excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the hand region of the primary motor cortex (M1HAND) to induce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the contralateral thumb. MEPs were acquired at four time-points within each trial - early online, late online, early offline, and late offline - as well as at the start and end of the overall stimulation period (to probe longer-lasting aftereffects of tACS). A significant increase in MEP amplitude was observed from pre- to post-tACS (P = 0.013) and from the first to the last tACS block (P = 0.008). However, no phase-dependent modulation of excitability was observed. Therefore, although SO tACS had a facilitatory effect on motor cortical excitability that outlasted stimulation, there was no evidence supporting entrainment of endogenous oscillations as the underlying mechanism.

Timely assessments are critical to providing early intervention and better hearing and spoken language outcomes for children with hearing loss. To facilitate faster diagnostic hearing assessments in infants, we developed the parallel auditory brainstem response (pABR), which presents randomly timed trains of tone pips at five frequencies to each ear simultaneously. We have shown that the pABR yields high-quality waveforms that are similar to the standard, single-frequency serial ABR but in a fraction of the recording time. While well-documented for standard ABRs, it is yet unknown how presentation rate and level interact to affect responses collected in parallel to random tone pip stimuli. Therefore, in this study we determined the optimal range of parameters for the pABR by recording responses across a range of six presentation rates, each at a low and high stimulus level. We show that a wide range of rates yields robust responses in under 15 minutes, but 40 Hz is the optimal singular presentation rate. Extending the analysis window to include later components of the response offers further time-saving advantages for the temporally broader responses to low frequency tone pips. Perceptual thresholds that subtly change across rate allow for a testing paradigm that easily transitions between rates, which may be useful for quickly estimating thresholds for different configurations of hearing loss. These optimized parameters facilitate expediency and effectiveness of the pABR to estimate hearing thresholds in a clinical setting.

During periods of rest, hippocampal place cells feature bursts of activity called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Heuristic approaches to their analysis have revealed that a small fraction of SWRs appear to "simulate" trajectories through the environment - called awake hippocampal replay - while the functional role of a majority of these SWRs remains unclear. Applying a novel probabilistic approach to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics embedded in SWRs, we instead show that almost all SWRs of foraging rodents simulate such trajectories through the environment. Furthermore, these trajectories feature momentum, that is, inertia in their velocities, that mirrors the animals' natural movement. This stands in contrast to replay events during sleep which seem to follow Brownian motion without such momentum. Lastly, interpreting the replay trajectories in the context of navigational planning revealed that similar past analyses were biased by the heuristic SWR sub-selection. Overall, our approach provides a more complete characterization of the spatio-temporal dynamics within SWRs, highlights qualitative differences between sleep and awake replay, and ought to support future, more detailed, and less biased analysis of the role of awake replay in navigational planning.

Abstract
The hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex are implicated in both episodic memory and encoding of position in an environment. In the present study, we examine the impact of locomotor behaviors associated with movement in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions on population activity patterns in these two brain structures. We utilized a five‐looped, squared spiral track containing stair segments, ramp segments, and flat segments. In addition to encoding locations along the full route, posterior parietal cortex population activity demonstrates strong pattern recurrence for similar action types at different locations in the environment. Additionally, posterior parietal and hippocampal neurons exhibit parallel modulation in the scale of representation that follows behavioral dynamics required for track traversal. These findings build on prior work examining spatial mapping in the vertical dimension and provide a better understanding of how a series of actions and visited locations can be coordinated in the generation of episodic memory.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) lacks of sensitivity in detecting cognitive deficits associated with subcortical damage. The HIV-Dementia Scale (HDS), a screening tool originally created for detecting cognitive impairment due to subcortical damage in HIV + patients, has proved to be useful in other neurological diseases. Until now, an Italian version of the HDS is not available. We aimed at: (1) validating the HDS Italian version (HDS-IT) in a cohort of cognitively healthy subjects (CN); (2) exploring the suitability of HDS-IT in detecting cognitive impairment due to subcortical damage (<em class="a-plus-plus">sc</em>CI). The psychometric properties of the HDS-IT were assessed in 180 CN (mean age 67.6 ± 8.3, range 41–84) with regard to item-total correlation, test–retest reliability and convergent validity with MMSE. Item-total correlations ranged 0.44–0.72. Test–retest reliability was 0.70 (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). The HDS-IT scores were positively associated with MMSE score (rS = 0.49, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). Then, both the HDS-IT and the MMSE were administered to 44 <em class="a-plus-plus">sc</em>CI subjects (mean age 64.9 ± 10.6, range 41–84). Mean HDS-IT total score was close to the original version and significantly lower in the <em class="a-plus-plus">sc</em>CI group compared to CN (8.6 ± 3.6 vs. 12.6 ± 2.5, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). ROC analysis yielded an optimal cutoff value of 11, with sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.82. Patients showed poorer scores on HDS-IT compared to CN (12.6 ± 2.5 vs. 8.6 ± 3.6, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). Our results support the use of HDS-IT as a screening tool suitable for detecting cognitive deficits with prevalent subcortical pattern, being complementary to MMSE in clinical practice.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Pain is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), affecting up to 85% of patients. The frequency and stability of pain over time has not been extensively studied. There is a paucity of high-quality studies investigating pain management in PD. To develop interventions, an understanding of how pain changes over the disease course is required.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">One hundred and fifty-four participants with early PD and 99 age-and-sex-matched controls were recruited as part of a longitudinal study (Incidence of Cognitive Impairment in Cohorts with Longitudinal Evaluation in PD, ICICLE-PD). Pain data were collected at 18-month intervals over 72 months in both groups using the Nonmotor Symptom Questionnaire (NMSQ), consisting of a binary yes/no response.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study shows that pain is prevalent even in the early stages of PD, yet the frequency and type of pain fluctuates as symptoms progress.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Leaked blood components, injured endothelial cells, local inflammatory response and vasospasm may converge to promote microthrombosis following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previously, we showed that the milk fat globule–epidermal growth factor 8 (MFGE8) can mitigate SAH-induced microthrombosis. This present study was aimed to explore the molecular pathway participated in MFGE8-dependent protection on vascular endothelium. Immunofluorescence, immunoblot and behavioral tests were used to determine the molecular partner and signaling pathway mediating the effect of MFGE8 in vascular endothelium in rats with experimental SAH and controls, together with the applications of RNA silencing and pharmacological intervention methods. Relative to control, recombinant human MFGE8 (rhMFGE8) treatment increased 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeled new endothelial cells, reduced TUNUL-positive endothelial cells and elevated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), in the brains of SAH rats. These effects were reversed by MFGE8 RNA silencing, as well as following cilengitide and wortmannin intervention. These results suggest that MFGE8 promotes endothelial regeneration and mitigates endothelial DNA damage through the activation of the TIGβ5/PI3K/CXCL12 signaling pathway.</p>

Antagonistic interactions between the center and surround receptive field (RF) components lie at the heart of the computations performed in the visual system. Center-surround RFs are thought to enhance responses to spatial contrasts (i.e., edges), but how they contribute to motion processing is unknown. Here, we addressed this question in retinal bipolar cells, the first visual neuron with classic center-surround interactions. We found that bipolar glutamate release emphasizes objects that emerge in the RF; their responses to continuous motion are smaller, slower, and cannot be predicted by signals elicited by stationary stimuli. The alteration in signal dynamics induced by novel objects dwarfs the enhancement of spatial edges and can be explained by priming of RF surround during continuous motion. These findings echo the salience of human visual perception and demonstrate an unappreciated capacity of the center-surround architecture to facilitate novel object detection and multiplexed encoding of distinct sensory modalities.

How do we choose the best action in a constantly-changing environment? Many natural decisions unfold in dynamic environments where newer observations carry better information about the present state of the world. Recent work has shown that rats can learn to optimally discount old evidence, updating their provisional decision when the environmental state changes. Provisional decisions are thought to be represented in the Frontal Orienting Fields (FOF), but this has only been tested in static environments where the provisional and final decisions are not easily dissociated. Here, we characterize the representation of accumulated evidence in rat FOF during decision-making in a dynamic environment. We find that FOF encodes evidence throughout decision formation with a temporal gain modulation that rises until the period when the animal may need to act. Using a behavioral model to predict the timing of changes of mind revealed that FOF neurons respond rapidly to these events, representing the new provisional decisions in their firing rates. Our results suggest that the FOF represents provisional decisions even in dynamic, uncertain environments, allowing for rapid motor execution when it is time to act.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) and there is evidence that mitochondrially-generated superoxide can activate NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), which is a major enzymatic generator of superoxide. Although NOX2 has been examined in the context of PD, previous studies have focused on microglial function; the role of neuronal NOX2 in PD pathogenesis remains to be defined. Here we devised and validated a proximity ligation assay for NOX2 activity and demonstrated that in human PD and 2 models thereof, neuronal NOX2 is highly active in substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Further, NOX2 activity is responsible for accumulation, post-translational modification and oligomerization of alpha-synuclein as well as activation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Administration of a brain-penetrant, specific NOX2 inhibitor prevented NOX2 activation and its downstream effects in vivo in a rat model of PD. We conclude that neuronal NOX2 is a major contributor to oxidative stress in PD, to alpha-synuclein pathology and to LRRK2 activation in idiopathic PD. In this context, NOX2 inhibitors hold potential as a disease-modifying therapy in PD.

Approaches to investigate adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) by targeted cell ablation in the rodent central nervous system have been limited by methodological challenges resulting in only partial and transient OPC depletion. We have developed a novel pharmacogenetic model of conditional OPC ablation, resulting in the elimination of 99.7% of all OPCs throughout the brain. By combining recombinase-based transgenic and viral strategies for targeting of OPCs and ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs), we found that new PDGFRA-expressing cells born in the V-SVZ repopulated the OPC-deficient brain starting 12 days after OPC ablation. Our data reveal that OPC depletion induces V-SVZ-derived NPCs to generate vast numbers of PDGFRA+/NG2+ cells with the capacity to migrate and proliferate extensively throughout the dorsal anterior forebrain. Further application of this novel approach to ablate OPCs will advance knowledge of the function of both OPCs and oligodendrogenic NPCs in health and disease.

<p>by Suyeon Heo, Yoondo Sung, Sang Wan Lee</p>

Depression is characterized by deficits in the reinforcement learning (RL) process. Although many computational and neural studies have extended our knowledge of the impact of depression on RL, most focus on habitual control (model-free RL), yielding a relatively poor understanding of goal-directed control (model-based RL) and arbitration control to find a balance between the two. We investigated the effects of subclinical depression on model-based and model-free learning in the prefrontal–striatal circuitry. First, we found that subclinical depression is associated with the attenuated state and reward prediction error representation in the insula and caudate. Critically, we found that it accompanies the disrupted arbitration control between model-based and model-free learning in the predominantly inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex. We also found that depression undermines the ability to exploit viable options, called exploitation sensitivity. These findings characterize how subclinical depression influences different levels of the decision-making hierarchy, advancing previous conflicting views that depression simply influences either habitual or goal-directed control. Our study creates possibilities for various clinical applications, such as early diagnosis and behavioral therapy design.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9aeQWxZ7b3A" width="1" />

Extracellular recording is an accessible technique used in animals and humans to study the brain physiology and pathology. As the number of recording channels and their density grows it is natural to ask how much improvement the additional channels bring in and how we can optimally use the new capabilities for monitoring the brain. Here we show that for any given distribution of electrodes we can establish exactly what information about current sources in the brain can be recovered and what information is strictly unobservable. We demonstrate this in the general setting of previously proposed kernel Current Source Density method and illustrate it with simplified examples as well as using evoked potentials from the barrel cortex obtained with a Neuropixels probe and with compatible model data. We show that with conceptual separation of the estimation space from experimental setup one can recover sources not accessible to standard methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wu2qYM5r6Go" width="1" />

Dual‐labeling immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing were used to characterize neurons in the basolateral amygdala that express SMI‐32+ nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs). Most of the neurons with strong somatic and dendritic expression of NNFs were parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, as well as nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs) that project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The graphical abstract shows six SMI‐32+ neurons (diffuse brown staining); five are also stained for PV (blue particulate staining) and one is PV‐negative (arrow).

Abstract
Cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) containing nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs) localized with the SMI‐32 monoclonal antibody have been shown to be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present investigation is the first to study the expression of SMI‐32+ NNFs in neurons of the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BNC), which contains cortex‐like PNs and nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs). We observed that PNs in the rat basolateral nucleus (BL), but not in the lateral (LAT) or basomedial (BM) nuclei, have significant levels of SMI‐32‐ir in their somata with antibody diluents that did not contain Triton X‐100, but staining in these cells was greatly attenuated when the antibody diluent contained 0.3% Triton. Using Triton‐containing diluents, we found that all SMI‐32+ neurons in all three of the BNC nuclei were NPNs. Using a dual‐labeling immunoperoxidase technique, we demonstrated that most of these SMI‐32+ NPNs were parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) or somatostatin‐positive NPNs but not vasoactive intestinal peptide‐positive or neuropeptide Y‐positive NPNs. Using a technique that combines retrograde tracing with SMI‐32 immunohistochemistry using intermediate levels of Triton in the diluent, we found that all BNC neurons projecting to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were large NPNs, and most were SMI‐32+. In contrast, BNC neurons projecting to the ventral striatum or cerebral cortex were PNs that expressed low levels of SMI‐32 immunoreactivity (SMI‐32‐ir) in the BL, and no SMI‐32‐ir in the LAT or BM. These data suggest that the main neuronal subpopulations in the BNC that degenerate in AD may be PV+ and MD‐projecting NPNs.

<p>Electroencephalograms (EEG) are noninvasive measurement signals of electrical
neuronal activity in the brain. One of the current major statistical challenges
is formally measuring functional dependency between those complex signals. This
paper, proposes the spectral causality model (SCAU), a robust linear model,
under a causality paradigm, to reflect inter- and intra-frequency modulation
effects that cannot be identifiable using other methods. SCAU inference is
conducted with three main steps: (a) signal decomposition into frequency bins,
(b) intermediate spectral band mapping, and (c) dependency modeling through
frequency-specific autoregressive models (VAR). We apply SCAU to study complex
dependencies during visual and lexical fluency tasks (word generation and
visual fixation) in 26 participants' EEGs. We compared the connectivity
networks estimated using SCAU with respect to a VAR model. SCAU networks show a
clear contrast for both stimuli while the magnitude links also denoted a low
variance in comparison with the VAR networks. Furthermore, SCAU dependency
connections not only were consistent with findings in the neuroscience
literature, but it also provided further evidence on the directionality of the
spatio-spectral dependencies such as the delta-originated and theta-induced
links in the fronto-temporal brain network.

<p>Climate models encapsulate our best understanding of the Earth system,
allowing research to be conducted on its future under alternative assumptions
of how human-driven climate forces are going to evolve. An important
application of climate models is to provide metrics of mean and extreme climate
changes, particularly under these alternative future scenarios, as these
quantities drive the impacts of climate on society and natural systems. Because
of the need to explore a wide range of alternative scenarios and other sources
of uncertainties in a computationally efficient manner, climate models can only
take us so far, as they require significant computational resources, especially
when attempting to characterize extreme events, which are rare and thus demand
long and numerous simulations in order to accurately represent their changing
statistics. Here we use deep learning in a proof of concept that lays the
foundation for emulating global climate model output for different scenarios.
We train two "loosely conditioned" Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that
emulate daily precipitation output from a fully coupled Earth system model: one
GAN modeling Fall-Winter behavior and the other Spring-Summer. Our GANs are
trained to produce spatiotemporal samples: 32 days of precipitation over a
64x128 regular grid discretizing the globe. We evaluate the generator with a
set of related performance metrics based upon KL divergence, and find the
generated samples to be nearly as well matched to the test data as the
validation data is to test. We also find the generated samples to accurately
estimate the mean number of dry days and mean longest dry spell in the 32 day
samples. Our trained GANs can rapidly generate numerous realizations at a
vastly reduced computational expense, compared to large ensembles of climate
models, which greatly aids in estimating the statistics of extreme events.

<p>Deep Learning (DL) has been utilized pervasively in the Internet of Things
(IoT). One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from
wireless signals, namely Non-cryptographic Device Identification (NDI).
However, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to
operational variations, such a paradigm is termed as Incremental Learning (IL).
Various IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated
space to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they
are not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. However, conventional IL
schemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not
available. In this paper, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new
perspective, firstly, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of
topological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of
class-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for
performance degradation in IL enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices'
fingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to
low topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems. Thirdly, we propose a
new Channel Separation Enabled Incremental Learning (CSIL) scheme without using
historical data, in which our strategy can automatically separate devices'
fingerprints in different learning stages and avoid potential conflict.
Finally, We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real
data from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), an application of
IoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to
accurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and
services. Data and code available at IEEE Dataport (DOI: 10.21227/1bxc-ke87)

<p>There is an analogy between the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture for
deep neural networks and an Euler solver for an ODE. The transformation
performed by each layer resembles an Euler step in solving an ODE. We consider
the Heun Method, which involves a single predictor-corrector cycle, and
complete the analogy, building a predictor-corrector variant of ResNet, which
we call a HeunNet. Just as Heun's method is more accurate than Euler's,
experiments show that HeunNet achieves high accuracy with low computational
(both training and test) time compared to both vanilla recurrent neural
networks and other ResNet variants.

<p>The Negative selection Algorithm (NSA) is one of the important methods in the
field of Immunological Computation (or Artificial Immune Systems). Over the
years, some progress was made which turns this algorithm (NSA) into an
efficient approach to solve problems in different domain. This review takes
into account these signs of progress during the last decade and categorizes
those based on different characteristics and performances. Our study shows that
NSA's evolution can be labeled in four ways highlighting the most notable NSA
variations and their limitations in different application domains. We also
present alternative approaches to NSA for comparison and analysis. It is
evident that NSA performs better for nonlinear representation than most of the
other methods, and it can outperform neural-based models in computation time.
We summarize NSA's development and highlight challenges in NSA research in
comparison with other similar models.

<p>We consider a biological network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The
DG is a pre-processor for pattern separation which facilitates pattern storage
and retrieval in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. The main encoding cells in
the DG are the granule cells (GCs) which receive the input from the entorhinal
cortex (EC) and send their output to the CA3. The activation degree of GCs is
so low (~ 5%). This sparsity has been thought to enhance the pattern
separation. We investigate the dynamical origin for winner-take-all (WTA)
competition which leads to sparse activation of the GCs. The whole GCs are
grouped into lamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I)
basket cell (BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs. There are three kinds of
external inputs into the GCs; the direct excitatory EC input, the indirect
inhibitory EC input, mediated by the HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated)
cells, and the excitatory input from the hilar mossy cells (MCs). The firing
activities of the GCs are determined via competition between the external E and
I inputs. The E-I conductance ratio ${\cal{R}}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ (given
by the time average of the external E to I conductances) may represents well
the degree of such external E-I input competition. GCs become active when their
$\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ is larger than a threshold ${\cal{R}}_{th}^*$,
and then the mean firing rates of the active GCs are strongly correlated with
$\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$. In each GC cluster, the feedback inhibition
of the BC may select the winner GCs. GCs with larger $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm
(con)*}$ than the threshold ${\cal{R}}_{th}^*$ survive, and they become
winners; all the other GCs with smaller $\cal{R}_{\rm E-I}^{\rm (con)*}$ become
silent. The WTA competition occurs via competition between the firing activity
of the GCs and the feedback inhibition from the BC in each GC cluster.

<p>Several recent works [40, 24] observed an interesting phenomenon in neural
network pruning: A larger finetuning learning rate can improve the final
performance significantly. Unfortunately, the reason behind it remains elusive
up to date. This paper is meant to explain it through the lens of dynamical
isometry [42]. Specifically, we examine neural network pruning from an unusual
perspective: pruning as initialization for finetuning, and ask whether the
inherited weights serve as a good initialization for the finetuning? The
insights from dynamical isometry suggest a negative answer. Despite its
critical role, this issue has not been well-recognized by the community so far.
In this paper, we will show the understanding of this problem is very important
-- on top of explaining the aforementioned mystery about the larger finetuning
rate, it also unveils the mystery about the value of pruning [5, 30]. Besides a
clearer theoretical understanding of pruning, resolving the problem can also
bring us considerable performance benefits in practice.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01952">Coverage Guided Testing for Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1911.01952v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied to a broad range of
applications, including natural language processing, drug discovery, and video
recognition. Their vulnerability to input perturbation is also known. Aligning
with a view from software defect detection, this paper aims to develop a
coverage guided testing approach to systematically exploit the internal
behaviour of RNNs, with the expectation that such testing can detect defects
with high possibility. Technically, the long short term memory network (LSTM),
a major class of RNNs, is thoroughly studied. A family of three test metrics
are designed to quantify not only the values but also the temporal relations
(including both step-wise and bounded-length) exhibited when LSTM processing
inputs. A genetic algorithm is applied to efficiently generate test cases. The
test metrics and test case generation algorithm are implemented into a tool
TestRNN, which is then evaluated on a set of LSTM benchmarks. Experiments
confirm that TestRNN has advantages over the state-of-art tool DeepStellar and
attack-based defect detection methods, owing to its working with finer temporal
semantics and the consideration of the naturalness of input perturbation.
Furthermore, TestRNN enables meaningful information to be collected and
exhibited for users to understand the testing results, which is an important
step towards interpretable neural network testing.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">AP3B2 is one of the subunits of vesicle coat protein AP3 and is specifically expressed in central nervous system neurons. AP3B2 antibody has been reported in patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia and various extracerebellar symptoms. However, there have been few reports on its clinical features and treatment response.</p>

                  <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 47-year-old man with AP3B2 antibody who presented with insidious-onset paresthesia and gait disturbance. His serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed reactivity with the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells and granular layer synapses comparable to the reported specific pattern of anti-AP3B2 IgG, and this was confirmed by a cell-based assay. His symptoms improved after the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, and oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil. Extensive examination and long-term follow-up showed no evidence of malignancy. A literature review was included to emphasize the neurological syndrome associated with this rare autoantibody.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Eleven cases with AP3B2 antibody, including our patient, were identified. The diversity of symptoms, including cerebellar and sensory ataxia, paresthesia, and weakness, was in line with the extensive binding of AP3B2 antibody to the spinal cord gray matter, dorsal root ganglia, cerebellar cortex, and nucleus. In the CSF, half of patients had elevated white blood cell counts, increased protein concentrations, or CSF-specific oligoclonal bands. All previous cases had subacute onsets and no improvement was noted after immunotherapy.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Our case indicated that disorders associated with AP3B2 antibody can also start insidiously. Immunotherapy is warranted given the possibility of clinical improvement.</p>

<p>Why can we still not translate preclinical research to clinical treatments for acute strokes? Despite &gt; 1000 successful preclinical studies, drugs, and concepts for acute stroke, only two have reached clinical translation. This is the translational block. Yet, we continue to routinely model strokes using almost the same concepts we have used for over 30 years. Methodological improvements and criteria from the last decade have shed some light but have not solved the problem. In this conceptual analysis, we review the current status and reappraise it by thinking “out-of-the-box” and over the edges. As such, we query why other scientific fields have also faced the same translational failures, to find common denominators. In parallel, we query how migraine, multiple sclerosis, and hypothermia in hypoxic encephalopathy have achieved significant translation successes. Should we view ischemic stroke as a “chronic, relapsing, vascular” disease, then secondary prevention strategies are also a successful translation. Finally, based on the lessons learned, we propose how stroke should be modeled, and how preclinical and clinical scientists, editors, grant reviewers, and industry should reconsider their routine way of conducting research. Translational success for stroke treatments may eventually require a bold change with solutions that are outside of the box.</p>

<p>The early detection and grading of gliomas is important for treatment decision and assessment of prognosis. Over the last decade numerous automated computer analysis tools have been proposed, which can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. In this paper, we used the gradient-based features extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images to depict the subtle changes within brains of patients with gliomas. Based on the gradient features, we proposed a novel two-phase classification framework for detection and grading of gliomas. In the first phase, the probability of each local feature being related to different types (e.g., diseased or healthy for detection, benign or malignant for grading) was calculated. Then the high-level feature representing the whole MRI image was generated by concatenating the membership probability of each local feature. In the second phase, the supervised classification algorithm was used to train a classifier based on the high-level features and patient labels of the training subjects. We applied this framework on the brain imaging data collected from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for glioma detection, and the public TCIA datasets including glioblastomas (WHO IV) and low-grade gliomas (WHO II and III) data for glioma grading. The experimental results showed that the gradient-based classification framework could be a promising tool for automatic diagnosis of brain tumors.</p>

<p>Neurological injuries such as strokes can lead to important loss in motor function. Thanks to neuronal plasticity, some of the lost functionality may be recovered over time. However, the recovery process is often slow and incomplete, despite the most effective conventional rehabilitation therapies. As we improve our understanding of the rules governing activity-dependent plasticity, neuromodulation interventions are being developed to harness neural plasticity to achieve faster and more complete recovery. Here, we review the principles underlying stimulation-driven plasticity as well as the most commonly used stimulation techniques and approaches. We argue that increased spatiotemporal precision is an important factor to improve the efficacy of neurostimulation and drive a more useful neuronal reorganization. Consequently, closed-loop systems and optogenetic stimulation hold theoretical promise as interventions to promote brain repair after stroke.</p>

<p>Training under high interference conditions through interleaved practice (IP) results in performance suppression during training but enhances long-term performance relative to repetitive practice (RP) involving low interference. Previous neuroimaging work addressing this contextual interference effect of motor learning has relied heavily on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology resulting in mixed reports of prefrontal cortex (PFC) recruitment under IP and RP conditions. We sought to clarify these equivocal findings by imaging bilateral PFC recruitment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while discrete key pressing sequences were trained under IP and RP schedules and subsequently tested following a 24-h delay. An advantage of fNIRS over the fMRI BOLD response is that the former measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes independently allowing for assessment of cortical hemodynamics even when there is neurovascular decoupling. Despite slower sequence performance durations under IP, bilateral PFC oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin values did not differ between practice conditions. During test, however, slower performance from those previously trained under RP coincided with hemispheric asymmetry in PFC recruitment. Specifically, following RP, test deoxygenated hemoglobin values were significantly lower in the right PFC. The present findings contrast with previous behavioral demonstrations of increased cognitive demand under IP to illustrate a more complex involvement of the PFC in the contextual interference effect. IP and RP incur similar levels of bilateral PFC recruitment, but the processes underlying the recruitment are dissimilar. PFC recruitment during IP supports action reconstruction and memory elaboration while RP relies on PFC recruitment to maintain task variation information in working memory from trial to trial. While PFC recruitment under RP serves to enhance immediate performance, it does not support long-term performance.</p>

<p>Social media platforms offer convenient, instantaneous social sharing on a mass scale with tremendous impact on public perceptions, opinions, and behavior. There is a need to understand why information spreads including the human motivations, cognitive processes, and neural dynamics of large-scale sharing. This study introduces a novel approach for investigating the effect social media messaging and in-person discussion has on the inter-brain dynamics within small groups of participants. The psychophysiological impact of information campaigns and narrative messaging within a closed social media environment was assessed using 24-channel wireless EEG. Data were acquired from three- or four-person groups while subjects debated contemporary social issues framed by four scenarios of varying controversy: (a) investing in ethical vs. unethical corporations, (b) selecting travel destination based on social awareness, (c) determining verdict in a murder trial and the punishment of life in prison or death penalty, and (d) decision to vaccinate. Pre-/post-scenario questionnaires assess the effects of the social media information. Inter-brain coherence between subject pairs on each social issue discussed by subjects was analyzed by concordance, agreement vs. disagreement, and by group unanimity, unanimous vs. not unanimous. Subject pairs that agreed on the social issues raised in the scenarios had significantly greater inter-brain coherence in gamma frequency range than disagreeing pairs over cortical regions known to be involved in social interactions. These effects were magnified when comparing groups where subject pairs were unanimous in their stance on the social issues for some but not all scenarios. While there was considerable overlap between scenarios in what EEG channels were significant, there was enough variability to indicate the possibility of scenario-specific effects on inter-brain coherence.</p>

<p>Dizocilpine (MK-801), a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, can induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy individuals, implicating NMDA-R hypofunction in disease pathogenesis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also implicated in schizophrenia, and expression is regulated by NMDA-R activity, suggesting a functional link. We previously found that BDNF signaling was upregulated by MK-801 in cultured hippocampal astrocytes, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. To address this issue, the levels of BDNF expression and secretion were evaluated in hippocampal astrocytes incubated with MK-801 by ELISA and qPCR, with and without NMDA co-incubation or pretreatment of either the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 or the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The apoptosis, viability, and proliferation of the astrocytes were also examined. In the current study, we demonstrate that MK-801 treatment (20 μM for 5 days) enhances the proliferation of rat cultured hippocampal astrocytes. Expression of BDNF mRNA was enhanced after 24 h in MK-801, but returned to near baseline over the next 24 h in the continued presence of MK-801. However, two successive 24-h treatments enhanced BDNF expression. These application regimens had no effect on apoptosis or proliferation rate. Co-addition of NMDA significantly inhibited MK-801-induced upregulation of BDNF. Similarly, MK-801-induced BDNF upregulation was blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of PI3K and ERK1/2, but not by inhibitors of p38 and JNK. These findings suggested that astrocytes may contribute to the acute neurological and behavioral response to MK-801 treatment via a transient increase in BDNF expression involving NMDA-R–PI3K–ERK signaling.</p>

<p>A secondary injury induced by a spinal cord injury (SCI) remains the main cause of devastating neural dysfunction; therefore, it has been the subject of focused research for many years. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been found to participate in the SCI process, and this finding presents a high potential for diagnosis and treatment; however, the role of lncRNA in a secondary injury induced by SCI remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of lncRNA growth arrest–specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in secondary injury during SCI. The SCI mice model and hypoxic cellular model were established to research the roles of lncRNA GAS5 during SCI. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to determine the expression levels of microR-93 (miR-93) and lncRNA GAS5. Western blot analysis of the apoptosis regulator protein and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was conducted to evaluate neuron cell apoptosis. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were calculated to assess neurological function. Flow cytometry was used to determine neuron cell apoptosis. The associations among GAS5, miR-93, and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were disclosed using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, RNA pulldown assay, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. QRT-PCR demonstrated that GAS5 was significantly upregulated in both the SCI mice and hypoxic cellular models. GAS5 knockdown suppressed neuron cell apoptosis and inflammatory response in the SCI mice model. Further studies have indicated that GAS5 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-93 in neuronal cells. In addition, PTEN was a target of miR-93, and GAS5 knockdown exhibited its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects through the miR-93/PTEN axis. These findings suggest that the GAS5/miR-93/PTEN axis may be a promising therapeutic target for SCI.</p>

<p>Background: Dementia is a gradual decline in cognitive ability and is becoming more common in our elderly population. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as a slight clinical deterioration of memory capacity, below the level of normal aging, but does not constitute a clinical diagnosis of dementia. To date, no interventions have been proven to cure MCI and dementia fully.</p><p>Purpose: To evaluate the potential effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and evaluate the methodological quality of systematic reviews (SRs).</p><p>Methods: We conducted a literature search for SRs with meta-analyses in seven Chinese and international databases through October 1, 2020. The basic characteristics of the included SRs/meta-analyses and the basic information of the original included randomized controlled trials were extracted by three reviewers independently. A meta-analysis of the original randomized controlled trials from the included SRs/meta-analyses was performed using Stata 12.0 software. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 was used to assess the methodological quality of the included SRs/meta-analyses, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to rate the quality of evidence.</p><p>Results: A total of 35 SRs/meta-analyses were included, and the majority showed that acupuncture was more effective than western medicine or conventional therapy for MCI and dementia [odds ratio =1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 1.56]. There was a statistically significant difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination score (weighted mean difference = 1.23; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.68; p &lt; 0.00001), and there was no significant improvement in the activities of daily living score (weighted mean difference = 1.58; 95% CI: −0.02, 3.18; p = 0.053). The assessment results of Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 showed that the methodological quality of most included SRs/meta-analyses was critically low; the lowest scores were items 2, 7, and 10. For Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, of the 73 outcomes, 50 (68.5%) outcomes were low or very low quality, and 23 (31.5%) outcomes were moderate quality.</p><p>Conclusions: Acupuncture can be considered as an alternative for the treatment of MCI and dementia when western medicine or other therapies are contraindicated. More high-quality evidence is needed to determine further the effectiveness of acupuncture.</p>

<p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, the incidence of which is significantly increased in elderly patients. One of the long-lasting effects of sepsis is cognitive impairment defined as a new deficit or exacerbation of preexisting deficits in global cognition or executive function. Normal brain function is dependent on moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow to match the increased demands of active brain regions. This homeostatic mechanism, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC, also known as functional hyperemia), is critically dependent on the production of vasodilator NO by microvascular endothelial cells in response to mediators released from activated astrocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that sepsis in aging leads to impairment of NVC responses early after treatment and that this neurovascular dysfunction associates with impairments in cognitive performance and vascular endothelial dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we used a commonly studied bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, to induce sepsis in experimental animals (males, 24 months of age) and subjected experimental animals to a standard clinical protocol of 3 doses of ampicillin i.p. and 14 days of amoxicillin added to the drinking water. NVC responses, endothelial function and cognitive performance were measured in septic and age-matched control groups within 14 days after the final antibiotic treatment. Our data demonstrate that sepsis in aging significantly impairs NVC responses measured in somatosensory cortex during whisker stimulation, significantly impairs endothelial function in isolated and pressure cannulated aorta rings in response to acetylcholine stimulation. No significant impairment of cognitive function in post-sepsis aged animals has been observed when measured using the PhenoTyper homecage based system. Our findings suggest that sepsis-associated endothelial dysfunction and impairment of NVC responses may contribute to long-term cognitive deficits in older sepsis survivors.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67855">Low-dimensional learned feature spaces quantify individual and group differences in vocal repertoires</a></h4>

Increases in the scale and complexity of behavioral data pose an increasing challenge for data analysis. A common strategy involves replacing entire behaviors with small numbers of handpicked, domain-specific features, but this approach suffers from several crucial limitations. For example, handpicked features may miss important dimensions of variability, and correlations among them complicate statistical testing. Here, by contrast, we apply the variational autoencoder (VAE), an unsupervised learning method, to learn features directly from data and quantify the vocal behavior of two model species: the laboratory mouse and the zebra finch. The VAE converges on a parsimonious representation that outperforms handpicked features on a variety of common analysis tasks, enables the measurement of moment-by-moment vocal variability on the timescale of tens of milliseconds in the zebra finch, provides strong evidence that mouse ultrasonic vocalizations do not cluster as is commonly believed, and captures the similarity of tutor and pupil birdsong with qualitatively higher fidelity than previous approaches. In all, we demonstrate the utility of modern unsupervised learning approaches to the quantification of complex and high-dimensional vocal behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67077">Functional dynamic genetic effects on gene regulation are specific to particular cell types and environmental conditions</a></h4>

Genetic effects on gene expression and splicing can be modulated by cellular and environmental factors; yet interactions between genotypes, cell type and treatment have not been comprehensively studied together. We used an induced pluripotent stem cell system to study multiple cell types derived from the same individuals and exposed them to a large panel of treatments. Cellular responses involved different genes and pathways for gene expression and splicing, and were highly variable across contexts. For thousands of genes, we identified variable allelic expression across contexts and characterized different types of gene-environment interactions, many of which are associated with complex traits. Promoter functional and evolutionary features distinguished genes with elevated allelic imbalance mean and variance. On average half of the genes with dynamic regulatory interactions were missed by large eQTL mapping studies, indicating the importance of exploring multiple treatments to reveal previously unrecognized regulatory loci that may be important for disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65683">Distinct protocerebral neuropils associated with attractive and aversive female-produced odorants in the male moth brain</a></h4>

The pheromone system of heliothine moths is an optimal model for studying principles underlying higher-order olfactory processing. In <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, three male-specific glomeruli receive input about three female-produced signals, the primary pheromone component, serving as an attractant, and two minor constituents, serving a dual function, i.e. attraction versus inhibition of attraction. From the antennal-lobe glomeruli, the information is conveyed to higher olfactory centers, including the lateral protocerebrum, via three main paths – of which the medial tract is the most prominent. In this study, we traced physiologically identified medial-tract projection neurons from each of the three male‑specific glomeruli with the aim of mapping their terminal branches in the lateral protocerebrum. Our data suggest that the neurons’ wide-spread projections are organized according to behavioral significance, including a spatial separation of signals representing attraction versus inhibition – however, with a unique capacity of switching behavioral consequence based on the amount of the minor components.

We study the effects of inbreeding in a dioecious plant on its interaction with pollinating insects and test whether the magnitude of such effects is shaped by plant individual sex and the evolutionary histories of plant populations. We recorded spatial, scent, colour and rewarding flower traits as well as pollinator visitation rates in experimentally inbred and outbred, male and female <i>Silene latifolia</i> plants from European and North American populations differing in their evolutionary histories. We found that inbreeding specifically impairs spatial flower traits and floral scent. Our results support that sex-specific selection and gene expression may have partially magnified these inbreeding costs for females, and that divergent evolutionary histories altered the genetic architecture underlying inbreeding effects across population origins. Moreover, the results indicate that inbreeding effects on floral scent may have a huge potential to disrupt interactions among plants and nocturnal moth pollinators, which are mediated by elaborate chemical communication.

The human kinome comprises 538 kinases playing essential functions by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Annotation of subcellular distribution of the kinome greatly facilitates investigation of normal and disease mechanisms. Here, we present Kinome Atlas (KA), an image-based map of the kinome annotated to 10 cellular compartments. 456 epitope-tagged kinases, representing 85% of the human kinome, were expressed in HeLa cells and imaged by immunofluorescent microscopy under a similar condition. KA revealed kinase family-enriched subcellular localizations, and discovered a collection of new kinase localizations at mitochondria, plasma membrane, extracellular space, and other structures. Furthermore, KA demonstrated the role of liquid-liquid phase separation in formation of kinase condensates. Identification of MOK as a mitochondrial kinase revealed its function in cristae dynamics, respiration, and oxidative stress response. Although limited by possible mislocalization due to overexpression or epitope tagging, this subcellular map of the kinome can be used to refine regulatory mechanisms involving protein phosphorylation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62233">A TORC1-histone axis regulates chromatin organisation and non-canonical induction of autophagy to ameliorate ageing</a></h4>

Age-related changes to histone levels are seen in many species. However, it is unclear whether changes to histone expression could be exploited to ameliorate the effects of ageing in multicellular organisms. Here we show that inhibition of mTORC1 by the lifespan-extending drug rapamycin increases expression of histones H3 and H4 post-transcriptionally, through eIF3-mediated translation. Elevated expression of H3/H4 in intestinal enterocytes in <i>Drosophila</i> alters chromatin organization, induces intestinal autophagy through transcriptional regulation, prevents age-related decline in the intestine. Importantly, it also mediates rapamycin-induced longevity and intestinal health. Histones H3/H4 regulate expression of an autophagy cargo adaptor Bchs (WDFY3 in mammals), increased expression of which in enterocytes mediates increased H3/H4-dependent healthy longevity. In mice, rapamycin treatment increases expression of histone proteins and <i>Wdfy3</i> transcription<i>,</i> and alters chromatin organisation in the small intestine, suggesting the mTORC1-histone axis is at least partially conserved in mammals and may offer new targets for anti-ageing interventions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59437">Do wealth and inequality associate with health in a small-scale subsistence society?</a></h4>

In high-income countries, one's relative socio-economic position and economic inequality may affect health and well-being, arguably via psychosocial stress. We tested this in a small-scale subsistence society, the Tsimane, by associating relative household wealth (n=871) and community-level wealth inequality (n=40, Gini = 0.15 – 0.53) with a range of psychological variables, stressors, and health outcomes (depressive symptoms [n=670], social conflicts [n=401], non-social problems [n=398], social support [n=399], cortisol [n=811], BMI [n=9926], blood pressure [n=3195], self-rated health [n=2523], morbidities [n=1542]) controlling for community-average wealth, age, sex, household size, community size, and distance to markets. Wealthier people largely had better outcomes while inequality associated with more respiratory disease, a leading cause of mortality. Greater inequality and lower wealth were associated with higher blood pressure. Psychosocial factors didn't mediate wealth-health associations. Thus, relative socio-economic position and inequality may affect health across diverse societies, though this is likely exacerbated in high-income countries.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55665">Spatiotemporal control of cell cycle acceleration during axolotl spinal cord regeneration</a></h4>

Axolotls are uniquely able to resolve spinal cord injuries, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying spinal cord regeneration. We previously found that tail amputation leads to reactivation of a developmental-like program in spinal cord ependymal cells (Rodrigo Albors <i>et al</i>., 2015), characterized by a high-proliferation zone emerging 4 days post-amputation (Rost <i>et al.</i>, 2016). What underlies this spatiotemporal pattern of cell proliferation, however, remained unknown. Here, we use modelling, tightly linked to experimental data, to demonstrate that this regenerative response is consistent with a signal that recruits ependymal cells during ~85 hours after amputation within ~830mm of the injury. We adapted FUCCI technology to axolotls (AxFUCCI) to visualize cell cycles <i>in vivo</i>. AxFUCCI axolotls confirmed the predicted appearance time and size of the injury-induced recruitment zone and revealed cell cycle synchrony between ependymal cells. Our modeling and imaging move us closer to understanding bona fide spinal cord regeneration.

Diverse subpopulations of astrocytes tile different brain regions to accommodate local requirements of neurons and associated neuronal circuits. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms governing astrocyte diversity remain mostly unknown. We explored the role of a zinc finger transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) that is expressed in astrocytes. We found that specific deletion of YY1 from astrocytes causes severe motor deficits in mice, induces Bergmann gliosis, and results in simultaneous loss of GFAP expression in velate and fibrous cerebellar astrocytes. Single cell RNA-seq analysis showed that YY1 exerts specific effects on gene expression in subpopulations of cerebellar astrocytes. We found that although YY1 is dispensable for the initial stages of astrocyte development, it regulates subtype-specific gene expression during astrocyte maturation. Moreover, YY1 is continuously needed to maintain mature astrocytes in the adult cerebellum. Our findings suggest that YY1 plays critical roles regulating cerebellar astrocyte maturation during development and maintaining a mature phenotype of astrocytes in the adult cerebellum.

Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) constitute an important tissue- and cell-type-specific layer of the regulome. Identification of risk variants for neuropsychiatric diseases within enhancers underscores the importance of understanding the population-level variation of eRNAs in the human brain. We jointly analyzed cell type-specific transcriptome and regulome data to identify 30,795 neuronal and 23,265 non-neuronal eRNAs, expanding the catalog of known human brain eRNAs by an order of magnitude. Examination of the population-level variation of the transcriptome and regulome in 1,382 brain samples identified reproducible changes affecting cis- and trans-co-regulation of eRNA-gene modules in schizophrenia. We show that 13% of schizophrenia heritability is jointly mediated in cis by brain gene and eRNA expression. Inclusion of eRNAs in transcriptome-wide association studies facilitated fine-mapping and functional interpretation of disease loci. Overall, our study characterizes the eRNA-gene regulome and genetic mechanisms in the human cortex in both healthy and disease states.

In response to phasic and tonic release, dopamine neurotransmission is regulated by its receptor subtypes, mainly dopamine receptor type 1 and 2 (DRD1 and DRD2). These dopamine receptors are known to form a heterodimer, however the receptor crosstalk between DRD1 and DRD2 was only suspected by measuring their downstream signaling products, due to the lack of methodology for selectively detecting individual activity of different dopamine receptors. Here, we develop red DRD1 sensor (R-DRD1) and green DRD2 sensor (G-DRD2) which can specifically monitor the real-time activity of DRD1 and DRD2, and apply these multicolor sensors to directly measure the receptor crosstalk in the DRD1-DRD2 heterodimer. Surprisingly, we discover that DRD1 activation in the heterodimer is inhibited only at micromolar phasic concentration of dopamine, while DRD2 activation is selectively inhibited at nanomolar tonic dopamine level. Differential receptor crosstalk in the DRD1-DRD2 heterodimer further modulates their downstream cAMP level. These data imply a novel function of the DRD1-DRD2 heterodimer at physiological dopamine levels of phasic and tonic release. Our approach utilizing multicolor receptor sensors will be useful to discover novel function of GPCR heterodimers.

To gain insight into the process by which animals choose between actions, we trained mice in a two-armed bandit task with time-varying reward probabilities. Whereas past work has modeled the selection of the higher rewarding port in such tasks, we sought to also model the trial-to-trial changes in port selection - i.e. the action switching behavior. We find that mouse behavior deviates from the theoretically optimal agent performing Bayesian inference in a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead the strategy of mice can be well-described by a set of models that we demonstrate are mathematically equivalent: a logistic regression, drift diffusion model, and 'sticky' Bayesian model. Here we show that switching behavior of mice is characterized by several components that are conserved across models, namely a stochastic action policy, a representation of action value, and a tendency to repeat actions despite incoming evidence. When fit to mouse behavior, the expected reward under these models lies near a plateau of the value landscape even in changing reward probability contexts. These results indicate that mouse behavior reaches near-maximal performance with reduced action switching and can be described by models with a small number of relatively fixed-parameters.

The mammalian endocannabinoid system, comprised of the endocannabinoids AEA (N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine) and 2-AG (2-Arachidonoylglycerol), their receptors, CB1 and CB2, and their metabolic enzymes, is believed to integrate internal energy state and external food cues to modulate feeding. For example, cannabinoids can increase preference for more palatable, calorically dense food: a response called hedonic amplification, colloquially known as "the munchies." In mammals, cannabinoids can increase sensitivity to odors and sweet tastes, which may underlie amplification. We use C. elegans, an omnivorous bacterivore, as a model in which to investigate the neurophysiology of hedonic amplification. We found that exposure to AEA increases the worms' preference for strongly preferred (more palatable) bacteria over weakly preferred (less palatable) bacteria, mimicking hedonic amplification in mammals. Furthermore, AEA acts bidirectionally, increasing consumption of strongly preferred bacteria while decreasing consumption of weakly preferred bacteria. We also found that deletion of the putative CB1 homolog, npr-19, eliminates hedonic amplification, which can be rescued by expression of wild type npr-19 or human CB1, establishing a humanized worm for cannabinoid signaling studies. Deletion of the olfactory neuron AWC, which directs chemotaxis to food, abolishes hedonic amplification. Consistent with this finding, calcium imaging revealed that AEA bidirectionally modulates AWC activity, increasing its responses to strongly preferred food and decreasing its response for weakly preferred food. In a GFP expression analysis, we found that npr-19 is expressed in approximately 21 neuron classes but, surprisingly, not in AWC. Although AEA's effect could be mediated by NPR-19-expressing neurons presynaptic to AWC, nearly complete elimination of fast synaptic transmission, via the mutation unc-13(e51), had no effect on modulation. Instead, it appears that AEA modulates AWC by activating one or more npr-19-expressing neurons that release a diffusible neuromodulator to which AWC is sensitive.

Cortical interneurons are indispensable for proper function of neocortical circuits. Changes in interneuron development and function are implicated in human disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. In order to understand human-specific features of cortical development as well as the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders it is crucial to identify the molecular programs underlying human interneuron development and subtype specification. Recent studies have explored gene expression programs underlying mouse interneuron specification and maturation. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to samples of second trimester human ganglionic eminence and developing cortex to identify molecularly defined subtypes of human interneuron progenitors and immature interneurons. In addition, we integrated this data from the developing human ganglionic eminences and neocortex with single-nucleus RNA-seq of adult cortical interneurons in order to elucidate dynamic molecular changes associated with commitment of progenitors and immature interneurons to mature interneuron subtypes. By comparing our data with published mouse single-cell genomic data, we discover a number of divergent gene expression programs that distinguish human interneuron progenitors from mouse. Moreover, we find that a number of transcription factors expressed during prenatal development become restricted to adult interneuron subtypes in the human but not the mouse, and these adult interneurons express species- and lineage-specific cell adhesion and synaptic genes. Therefore, our study highlights that despite the similarity of main principles of cortical interneuron development and lineage commitment between mouse and human, human interneuron genesis and subtype specification is guided by species-specific gene programs, contributing to human-specific features of cortical inhibitory interneurons.

The nervous and endocrine systems coordinately monitor and regulate nutrient availability to maintain energy homeostasis. Sensory detection of food regulates internal nutrient availability in a manner that anticipates food intake, but sensory pathways that promote anticipatory physiological changes remain unclear. Here, we identify serotonergic (5-HT) neurons as critical mediators that transform gustatory detection by sensory neurons into the activation of insulin-producing cells and enteric neurons in Drosophila. One class of 5-HT neurons responds to gustatory detection of sugars, excites insulin-producing cells and limits consumption, suggesting that they anticipate increased nutrient levels and prevent overconsumption. A second class of 5-HT neurons responds to gustatory detection of bitter compounds and activates enteric neurons to promote gastric motility, likely to stimulate digestion and increase circulating nutrients when food quality is poor. These studies demonstrate that 5-HT neurons relay acute gustatory detection to divergent pathways for longer-term stabilization of circulating nutrients.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging 3D imaging technique that allows quantification of intrinsic optical properties such as scattering coefficient and back-scattering coefficient, and has proved useful in distinguishing delicate microstructures in the human brain. The origins of scattering in brain tissues are contributed by the myelin content, neuron size and density primarily; however, no quantitative relationships between them have been reported, which hampers the use of OCT in fundamental studies of architectonic areas in the human brain and the pathological evaluations of diseases. To date, histology remains the golden standard, which is prone to errors and can only work on a small number of subjects. Here, we demonstrate a novel method that uses serial sectioning OCT to quantitatively measure myelin content and neuron density in the human brain. We found that the scattering coefficient possesses a strong linear relationship with the myelin content across different regions of the human brain, while the neuron density serves as a secondary contribution that only slightly modulates the overall tissue scattering.

In Parkinsons disease (PD), neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons occurs in the midbrain, specifically targeting the substantia nigra (SN), while leaving the ventral tegmental area (VTA) relatively spared in early phases of the disease. Although the SN and VTA are known to be functionally dissociable in healthy adults, it remains unclear how this dissociation is altered in PD. To examine this issue, we performed a whole-brain analysis to compare functional coupling in PD to healthy adults using resting-state fMRI data compiled from three independent datasets. Our analysis showed that across the sample, the SN had greater coupling to the precuneus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and areas of the occipital cortex, partially replicating our previous work in healthy young adults. Notably, we also found that, in PD, VTA-right cerebellum coupling was higher than SN-right cerebellum coupling, whereas the opposite trend occurred in healthy controls. This double dissociation may reflect a compensatory role of the cerebellum in PD and could provide a potential target for future study and treatment.

Response inhibition is among the core constructs of cognitive control. It is notoriously difficult to quantify from overt behavior, since the outcome of successful inhibition is the lack of a behavioral response. Therefore, model-based approaches have been developed to estimate the inhibition latency, such as the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) using the stop signal task. However, the model assumptions underlying the SSRT can be difficult to meet in practice. Recently, partial response electromyography (prEMG) has been introduced as a physiological measure to capture individual stopping latencies. PrEMG refers to muscle activity initiated by the go signal that plummets after the stop signal, before its accumulation to a full response. We provide a comprehensive overview of prEMG in a stop signal task, together with practical tips for data collection and analysis. Our analysis indicates that prEMG is a unique and reliable measure of stopping and we encourage its widespread use to investigate response inhibition.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.13.443987v1?rss=1">Using ephaptic coupling to estimate the synaptic cleft resistivity of the calyx of Held synapse.</a></h4>

At synapses, the pre- and postsynaptic cell get so close that currents entering the cleft do not flow exclusively along its conductance, gcl. A prominent example is found in the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, where the presynaptic action potential can be recorded in the postsynaptic cell in the form of a prespike. Here, we developed a theoretical framework for ephaptic coupling via the synaptic cleft. We found that the capacitive component of the prespike recorded in voltage clamp is closely approximated by the second time derivative of the presynaptic action potential. Its size scales with the fourth power of the radius of the synapse, explaining why intracellularly recorded prespikes are uncommon in the CNS. We show that presynaptic calcium currents can contribute to the prespike and that their contribution is closely approximated by the scaled first derivative of these currents. We confirmed these predictions in juvenile rat brainstem slices, and used the presynaptic calcium currents to obtain an estimate for gcl of ~1 S. We demonstrate that for a typical synapse geometry, gcl is scale-invariant and only defined by extracellular resistivity, which was ~75 {Omega}cm, and by cleft height. During development the calyx of Held develops fenestrations. These fenestrations effectively minimize the cleft potentials generated by the adult action potential, which would otherwise interfere with calcium channel opening. We thus provide a quantitative account of the dissipation of currents by the synaptic cleft, which can be readily extrapolated to conventional, bouton-like synapses.

Anxiety disorders are prevalent across the United States and result in a large personal and societal burden. Currently, numerous therapeutic and pharmaceutical treatment options exist. However, drugs to classical receptor targets have shown limited efficacy and often come with unpleasant side effects, highlighting the need to identify novel targets involved in the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. GPR83, a recently deorphanized receptor activated by the abundant neuropeptide PEN, has also been identified as a glucocorticoid regulated receptor (and named GIR) suggesting that this receptor may be involved in stress-responses that underlie anxiety. Consistent with this, GPR83 null mice have been found to be resistant to stress-induced anxiety. However, studies examining the role of GPR83 within specific brain regions or potential sex differences have been lacking. In this study, we investigate anxiety-related behaviors in male and female mice with global knockout and following local GPR83 knockdown in female mice. We find that a global knockdown of GPR83 has minimal impact on anxiety-like behaviors in female mice and a decrease in anxiety-related behaviors in male mice. In contrast, a local GPR83 knockdown in the basolateral amygdala leads to more anxiety-related behaviors in female mice. Local GPR83 knockdown in the central amygdala or nucleus accumbens showed no significant effect on anxiety-related behaviors. Finally, dexamethasone administration leads to a significant decrease in receptor expression in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens of female mice. Together, our studies uncover a significant, but divergent role for GPR83 in different brain regions in the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors, which is furthermore dependent on sex.

The study of neuron morphology requires robust and comprehensive methods to quantify the differences between neurons of different subtypes and animal species. Several software packages have been developed for the analysis of neuron tracing results stored in the standard SWC format. However, providing relatively simple quantifications and their non-extendable architecture prohibit their use for advanced data analysis and visualization. We developed nGauge, a Python toolkit to support the parsing and analysis of neuron morphology data. As an application programming interface (API), nGauge can be referenced by other popular open-source software to create custom informatics analysis pipelines and advanced visualizations. nGauge defines an extendable data structure that handles volumetric constructions (e.g. soma), in addition to the SWC linear reconstructions, while remaining light-weight. This greatly extends nGauge's data compatibility.

Atypical sensory processing is currently included within the diagnostic criteria of autism. The cerebellum is known to integrate sensory inputs of different modalities through its connectivity to the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, cerebellar malformations are among the most replicated features found in postmortem brain of individuals with autism. We studied cerebellar integration of sensory information in a mouse model of autism, knockout for the Cntnap2 gene. Cntnap2 is widely expressed in Purkinje cells and has been recently reported to regulate their morphology. Further, individuals with CNTNAP2 mutations display cerebellar malformations and CNTNAP2 antibodies are associated with a mild form of cerebellar ataxia. Previous studies in this mouse model show an altered cerebellar sensory learning. However, a physiological analysis of cerebellar function has not been performed yet. We studied sensory evoked potentials in cerebellar Crus I/II region upon electrical stimulation of the whisker pad in alert mice and found striking differences between WT and Cntnap2 KO mice. In addition, single-cell recordings identified alterations in both sensory-evoked and spontaneous firing patterns of Purkinje cells. These alterations were accompanied by altered intrinsic properties and morphological features of these neurons. Together, these results indicate that the Cntnap2 mouse model could provide novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD core sensory deficits.

The depletion of NAD is intimately linked to neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Excessive activation of NAD+-consuming enzymes that hydrolyze NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, supplementation of NAD or its precursors failed to show any benefits for most patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying this are largely undefined. Here we show that ADP-ribose, as an endogenous NAD metabolite, triggers neuronal cell death by glutathione-independent ferroptosis. The neuronal cells in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were severely reduced under the treatment of ADP-ribose in mice. Intracellular ADP-ribose, an endogenous inhibitor of NAD-cofactor enzymes, but not NAD-consuming enzymes, is an accelerator of ferroptosis by blocking the catabolism of lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the extracellular ADP-ribose directly binds to membrane surface nucleoside transporter ENT1 to orchestrate purine and pyrimidine metabolism. ENT1-hypoxanthine axis and glutamine-dihydroorotate-quinone pathway are independent and intersecting, which is specifically mobilized by ADP-ribose to trigger ferroptosis. Precisely because of it, we find that the neuronal death by ADP-ribose can be rescued by XO and DHODH inhibitors. Moreover, endogenous ADP-ribose levels are increased on oxidative stress and PROTAC of PARP1 maintain neuronal survival under these circumstances. We provide evidence that ADP-ribose is a key metabolite that is used for disease diagnosis and drug target. Our analyses uncover new molecular links between NAD metabolism and ferroptosis in the regulation of neuronal death, thus suggesting new strategies for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

The structure of neuronal connectivity often provides insights into the relevant stimulus features, such as spatial location, orientation, sound frequency, etc1-6. The olfactory system, however, appears to lack structured connectivity as suggested by reports of broad and distributed connections both from the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex7-22 and within the cortex23-25. These studies have inspired computational models of circuit function that rely on random connectivity26-33. It remains, nonetheless, unclear whether the olfactory connectivity contains spatial structure. Here, we use high throughput anatomical methods (MAPseq and BARseq)34-38 to analyze the projections of 5,309 bulb and 30,433 piriform cortex output neurons in the mouse at single-cell resolution. We identify previously unrecognized spatial organization in connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis (A-P) of the piriform cortex. We find that both the bulb projections to the cortex and the cortical outputs are not random, but rather form gradients along the A-P axis. Strikingly, these gradients are matched: bulb neurons targeting a given location within the piriform cortex co-innervate extra-piriform regions that receive strong inputs from neurons within that piriform locus. We also identify signatures of local connectivity in the piriform cortex. Our findings suggest an organizing principle of matched direct and indirect olfactory pathways that innervate extra-piriform targets in a coordinated manner, thus supporting models of information processing that rely on structured connectivity within the olfactory system.

We consider a biological network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The DG is a pre-processor for pattern separation which facilitates pattern storage and retrieval in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. The main encoding cells in the DG are the granule cells (GCs) which receive the input from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and send their output to the CA3. We note that the activation degree of GCs is so low (~ 5%). This sparsity has been thought to enhance the pattern separation. We investigate the dynamical origin for winner-take-all (WTA) competition which leads to sparse activation of the GCs. The whole GCs are grouped into lamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell (BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs. There are three kinds of external inputs into the GCs; the direct excitatory EC input, the indirect inhibitory EC input, mediated by the HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated) cells, and the excitatory input from the hilar mossy cells (MCs). The firing activities of the GCs are determined via competition between the external E and I inputs. The E-I conductance ratio RE-I(con)* (given by the time average of the external E to I conductances) may represents well the degree of such external E-I input competition. It is thus found that GCs become active when their RE-I(con)* is larger than a threshold R*th, and then the mean firing rates of the active GCs are strongly correlated with RE-I(con)*. In each GC cluster, the feedback inhibition of the BC may select the winner GCs. GCs with larger RE-I(con)* than the threshold R*th survive, and they become winners; all the other GCs with smaller RE-I(con)* become silent. In this way, WTA competition occurs via competition between the firing activity of the GCs and the feedback inhibition from the BC in each GC cluster. In this case, the hilar MCs are also found to play an essential role of enhancing the WTA competition in each GC cluster by exciting both the GCs and the BC.

A strategy to gain insight into early changes that may predispose people to Alzheimers disease is to study the brains of younger cognitively healthy people that are at increased genetic risk of AD. The Apolipoprotein (APOE) E4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, and several neuroimaging studies comparing APOE E4 carriers with non-carriers at age ~20-30 have detected hyperactivity (or reduced deactivation) in posteromedial cortex (PMC), a key hub of the default network (DN) which has a high susceptibility to early amyloid deposition in AD. Transgenic mouse models suggest such early network activity alterations may result from altered excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, but this is yet to be examined in humans. Here we test the hypothesis that PMC fMRI hyperactivity could be underpinned by altered levels of excitatory (glutamate) and/or inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters in this brain region. Forty-seven participants (20 APOE E4 carriers and 27 non-carriers) aged 18-25 underwent resting-state proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique to measure glutamate and GABA in vivo. Metabolites were measured in a PMC voxel of interest and in a comparison voxel in the occipital cortex (OCC). There was no difference in either glutamate or GABA between the E4 carriers and non-carriers in either MRS voxel, nor in the ratio of glutamate to GABA, a measure of E/I balance. Default Bayesian t-tests revealed evidence in support of this null finding. Results suggest that PMC hyperactivity in APOE E4 carriers is unlikely to be associated with, or indeed may precede, alterations in local resting-state PMC neurotransmitters, thus informing the spatio-temporal order and the cause/effect dynamic of neuroimaging differences in APOE E4 carriers.

Application of RNA sequencing has enabled the characterization of genome-wide gene expression in the human brain, including distinct layers of the neocortex. Neuroanatomically, the molecular patterns that underlie the laminar organization of the neocortex can help link structure to circuitry and function. To advance our understanding of cortical architecture, we created LaminaRGeneVis, a web application that displays across-layer cortical gene expression from multiple datasets. These datasets were collected using bulk, single-nucleus, and spatial RNA sequencing methodologies and these data were harmonized to facilitate comparisons between datasets. The online resource facilitates single- and multi-gene analyses by providing figures and statistics for user-friendly assessment of laminar gene expression patterns in the adult human neocortex. Availability and implementation: LaminaRGeneVis is available at https://ethanhkim.shinyapps.io/laminargenevis. The source code and data is accessible at https://github.com/ethanhkim/laminargenevis.

A central challenge in face perception research is to understand how neurons encode various face identities. However, this challenge has not been met largely due to the lack of simultaneous access to the activity of the entire face processing neural network as well as the lack of a comprehensive multifaceted model that is able to characterize a large number of facial features. In this study, we address this challenge by conducting in silico experiments using a deep neural network (DNN) capable of face recognition with a diverse array of stimuli. We identified a subset of DNN neurons selective to face identities, and these identity-selective neurons demonstrated generalized discriminability to novel faces not involved in the training and in many different styles. Visualization of the network explained the response of the DNN neurons and manipulation of the network confirmed the importance of identity-selective neurons in face recognition. Importantly, using our human single-neuron recordings, we directly compared the response of artificial neurons with 490 real human neurons to the same stimuli and found that artificial neurons did share a similar representation of facial features as human neurons. We also observed a novel region-based feature coding mechanism in DNN neurons as in human neurons, which may explain how the DNN performs face recognition. Together, by directly linking between artificial and human neurons, our results shed light on how human neurons encode face identities.

With electronic (e)-liquids containing cannabis components easily available, many anecdotal examples of cannabis vaping using electronic cigarette devices have been reported. For electronic cigarette cannabis vaping, there are potential risks of secondary indoor air pollution from vapers. However, quantitative and accurate prediction of the inhalation and dermal exposure of a passive smoker in the same room is difficult to achieve due to the ethical constraints on subject experiments. The numerical method, i.e., <i>in silico</i> method, is a powerful tool to complement these experiments with real humans. In this study, we adopted a computer-simulated person that has been validated from multiple perspectives for prediction accuracy. We then conducted an <i>in silico</i> study to elucidate secondary indoor air pollution and passive smoking associated with cannabis vaping using an electronic cigarette device in an indoor environment. The aerosols exhaled by a cannabis vaper were confirmed to be a secondary emission source in an indoor environment; non-smokers were exposed to these aerosols via respiratory and dermal pathways. Tetrahydrocannabinol was used as a model chemical compound for the exposure study. Its uptake by the non-smoker through inhalation and dermal exposure under a worst-case scenario was estimated to be 5.9% and 2.6% of the exhaled quantity from an e-cigarette cannabis user, respectively.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P_GHhmu4SWc" width="1" />

The determination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures at atomic resolution has improved understanding of cellular signaling and will accelerate the development of new drug candidates. However, experimental structures still remain unavailable for a majority of the GPCR family. GPCR structures and their interactions with ligands can also be modelled computationally, but such predictions have limited accuracy. In this work, we explored if molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could be used to refine the accuracy of <i>in silico</i> models of receptor-ligand complexes that were submitted to a community-wide assessment of GPCR structure prediction (GPCR Dock). Two simulation protocols were used to refine 30 models of the D<sub>3</sub> dopamine receptor (D<sub>3</sub>R) in complex with an antagonist. Close to 60 μs of simulation time was generated and the resulting MD refined models were compared to a D<sub>3</sub>R crystal structure. In the MD simulations, the transmembrane helix region of the models generally drifted further away from the crystal structure conformation. However, MD refinement was able to improve the accuracy of the ligand binding mode and the second extracellular loop region. The best refinement protocol improved agreement with the experimentally observed ligand binding mode for a majority of the models. Receptor structures with improved virtual screening performance, which was assessed by molecular docking of ligands and decoys, could also be identified among the MD refined models. Application of weak restraints to the transmembrane helixes in the MD simulations further improved predictions of the ligand binding mode and second extracellular loop. These results provide guidelines for application of MD refinement in prediction of GPCR-ligand complexes and directions for further method development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/30b3CvNBcXE" width="1" />

The investigation of cell shapes mostly relies on the manual classification of 2D images, causing a subjective and time consuming evaluation based on a portion of the cell surface. We present a dual-stage neural network architecture for analyzing fine shape details from confocal microscopy recordings in 3D. The system, tested on red blood cells, uses training data from both healthy donors and patients with a congenital blood disease, namely hereditary spherocytosis. Characteristic shape features are revealed from the spherical harmonics spectrum of each cell and are automatically processed to create a reproducible and unbiased shape recognition and classification. The results show the relation between the particular genetic mutation causing the disease and the shape profile. With the obtained 3D phenotypes, we suggest our method for diagnostics and theragnostics of blood diseases. Besides the application employed in this study, our algorithms can be easily adapted for the 3D shape phenotyping of other cell types and extend their use to other applications, such as industrial automated 3D quality control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ScLdcLYEclY" width="1" />

Deep neural networks have demonstrated improved performance at predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins compared to previous methods that rely on <i>k</i>-mers and position weight matrices. To gain insights into why a DNN makes a given prediction, model interpretability methods, such as attribution methods, can be employed to identify motif-like representations along a given sequence. Because explanations are given on an individual sequence basis and can vary substantially across sequences, deducing generalizable trends across the dataset and quantifying their effect size remains a challenge. Here we introduce global importance analysis (GIA), a model interpretability method that quantifies the population-level effect size that putative patterns have on model predictions. GIA provides an avenue to quantitatively test hypotheses of putative patterns and their interactions with other patterns, as well as map out specific functions the network has learned. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of GIA on the computational task of predicting RNA-protein interactions from sequence. We first introduce a convolutional network, we call ResidualBind, and benchmark its performance against previous methods on RNAcompete data. Using GIA, we then demonstrate that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that considers the number of motifs, their spacing, and sequence context, such as RNA secondary structure and GC-bias.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NZtyHrKkm00" width="1" />

<p>by Jeet Sukumaran, Mark T. Holder, L. Lacey Knowles</p>

The “multispecies” coalescent (MSC) model that underlies many genomic species-delimitation approaches is problematic because it does not distinguish between genetic structure associated with species versus that of populations within species. Consequently, as both the genomic and spatial resolution of data increases, a proliferation of artifactual species results as within-species population lineages, detected due to restrictions in gene flow, are identified as distinct species. The toll of this extends beyond systematic studies, getting magnified across the many disciplines that rely upon an accurate framework of identified species. Here we present the first of a new class of approaches that addresses this issue by incorporating an extended speciation process for species delimitation. We model the formation of population lineages and their subsequent development into independent species as separate processes and provide for a way to incorporate current understanding of the species boundaries in the system through specification of species identities of a subset of population lineages. As a result, species boundaries and within-species lineages boundaries can be discriminated across the entire system, and species identities can be assigned to the remaining lineages of unknown affinities with quantified probabilities. In addition to the identification of species units in nature, the primary goal of species delimitation, the incorporation of a speciation model also allows us insights into the links between population and species-level processes. By explicitly accounting for restrictions in gene flow not only between, but also within, species, we also address the limits of genetic data for delimiting species. Specifically, while genetic data alone is not sufficient for accurate delimitation, when considered in conjunction with other information we are able to not only learn about species boundaries, but also about the tempo of the speciation process itself.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aidv0pSWtyU" width="1" />

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks have caused universities all across the globe to close their campuses and forced them to initiate online teaching. This article reviews the pedagogical foundations for developing effective distance education practices, starting from the assumption that promoting autonomous thinking is an essential element to guarantee full citizenship in a democracy and for moral decision-making in situations of rapid change, which has become a pressing need in the context of a pandemic. In addition, the main obstacles related to this new context are identified, and solutions are proposed according to the existing bibliography in learning sciences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zu0dFZCrv6o" width="1" />

Cellular and intracellular processes are inherently complex due to the large number of components and interactions, which are often nonlinear and occur at different spatiotemporal scales. Because of this complexity, mathematical modeling is increasingly used to simulate such systems and perform experiments in silico, many orders of magnitude faster than real experiments and often at a higher spatiotemporal resolution. In this article, we will focus on the generic modeling process and illustrate it with an example model of membrane lipid turnover.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1dsFTqVI2R0" width="1" />

<p>by Niloofar Shahidi, Michael Pan, Soroush Safaei, Kenneth Tran, Edmund J. Crampin, David P. Nickerson</p>

Simulating complex biological and physiological systems and predicting their behaviours under different conditions remains challenging. Breaking systems into smaller and more manageable modules can address this challenge, assisting both model development and simulation. Nevertheless, existing computational models in biology and physiology are often not modular and therefore difficult to assemble into larger models. Even when this is possible, the resulting model may not be useful due to inconsistencies either with the laws of physics or the physiological behaviour of the system. Here, we propose a general methodology for composing models, combining the energy-based bond graph approach with semantics-based annotations. This approach improves model composition and ensures that a composite model is physically plausible. As an example, we demonstrate this approach to automated model composition using a model of human arterial circulation. The major benefit is that modellers can spend more time on understanding the behaviour of complex biological and physiological systems and less time wrangling with model composition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g8DGq7wh2Ds" width="1" />

The mitochondrial ATP synthase emerges as key hub of cellular functions controlling the production of ATP, cellular signaling, and fate. It is regulated by the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), which is highly abundant in neurons. Herein, we ablated or overexpressed IF1 in mouse neurons to show that IF1 dose defines the fraction of active/inactive enzyme in vivo, thereby controlling mitochondrial function and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses indicate that IF1 dose regulates mitochondrial metabolism, synaptic function, and cognition. Ablation of IF1 impairs memory, whereas synaptic transmission and learning are enhanced by IF1 overexpression. Mechanistically, quenching the IF1-mediated increase in mtROS production in mice overexpressing IF1 reduces the increased synaptic transmission and obliterates the learning advantage afforded by the higher IF1 content. Overall, IF1 plays a key role in neuronal function by regulating the fraction of ATP synthase responsible for mitohormetic mtROS signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/q6ZupBs9I6E" width="1" />

<p>by Jordi van Gestel, Andreas Wagner</p>

The repeated evolution of multicellularity leads to a wide diversity of organisms, many of which are sessile, including land plants, many fungi, and colonial animals. Sessile organisms adhere to a surface for most of their lives, where they grow and compete for space. Despite the prevalence of surface-associated multicellularity, little is known about its evolutionary origin. Here, we introduce a novel theoretical approach, based on spatial lineage tracking of cells, to study this origin. We show that multicellularity can rapidly evolve from 2 widespread cellular properties: cell adhesion and the regulatory control of adhesion. By evolving adhesion, cells attach to a surface, where they spontaneously give rise to primitive cell collectives that differ in size, life span, and mode of propagation. Selection in favor of large collectives increases the fraction of adhesive cells until a surface becomes fully occupied. Through kin recognition, collectives then evolve a central-peripheral polarity in cell adhesion that supports a division of labor between cells and profoundly impacts growth. Despite this spatial organization, nascent collectives remain cryptic, lack well-defined boundaries, and would require experimental lineage tracking technologies for their identification. Our results suggest that cryptic multicellularity could readily evolve and originate well before multicellular individuals become morphologically evident.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtERbAWvuPU" width="1" />

<p>In past years model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has been one of the most
promising approaches in meta-learning. It can be applied to different kinds of
problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, but also shows good results on few-shot
learning tasks. Besides their tremendous success in these tasks, it has still
not been fully revealed yet, why it works so well. Recent work proposes that
MAML rather reuses features than rapidly learns. In this paper, we want to
inspire a deeper understanding of this question by analyzing MAML's
representation. We apply representation similarity analysis (RSA), a
well-established method in neuroscience, to the few-shot learning instantiation
of MAML. Although some part of our analysis supports their general results that
feature reuse is predominant, we also reveal arguments against their
conclusion. The similarity-increase of layers closer to the input layers arises
from the learning task itself and not from the model. In addition, the
representations after inner gradient steps make a broader change to the
representation than the changes during meta-training.

<p>Image content is a predominant factor in marketing campaigns, websites and
banners. Today, marketers and designers spend considerable time and money in
generating such professional quality content. We take a step towards
simplifying this process using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We
propose a simple and novel conditioning strategy which allows generation of
images conditioned on given semantic attributes using a generator trained for
an unconditional image generation task. Our approach is based on modifying
latent vectors, using directional vectors of relevant semantic attributes in
latent space. Our method is designed to work with both discrete (binary and
multi-class) and continuous image attributes. We show the applicability of our
proposed approach, named Directional GAN, on multiple public datasets, with an
average accuracy of 86.4% across different attributes.

<p>Scene understanding requires the extraction and representation of scene
components together with their properties and inter-relations. We describe a
model in which meaningful scene structures are extracted from the image by an
iterative process, combining bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) networks,
interacting through a symmetric bi-directional communication between them
(counter-streams structure). The model constructs a scene representation by the
iterative use of three components. The first model component is a BU stream
that extracts selected scene elements, properties and relations. The second
component (cognitive augmentation) augments the extracted visual representation
based on relevant non-visual stored representations. It also provides input to
the third component, the TD stream, in the form of a TD instruction,
instructing the model what task to perform next. The TD stream then guides the
BU visual stream to perform the selected task in the next cycle. During this
process, the visual representations extracted from the image can be combined
with relevant non-visual representations, so that the final scene
representation is based on both visual information extracted from the scene and
relevant stored knowledge of the world. We describe how a sequence of
TD-instructions is used to extract from the scene structures of interest,
including an algorithm to automatically select the next TD-instruction in the
sequence. The extraction process is shown to have favorable properties in terms
of combinatorial generalization, generalizing well to novel scene structures
and new combinations of objects, properties and relations not seen during
training. Finally, we compare the model with relevant aspects of the human
vision, and suggest directions for using the BU-TD scheme for integrating
visual and cognitive components in the process of scene understanding.

<p>Adder neural network (AdderNet) is a new kind of deep model that replaces the
original massive multiplications in convolutions by additions while preserving
the high performance. Since the hardware complexity of additions is much lower
than that of multiplications, the overall energy consumption is thus reduced
significantly. To further optimize the hardware overhead of using AdderNet,
this paper studies the winograd algorithm, which is a widely used fast
algorithm for accelerating convolution and saving the computational costs.
Unfortunately, the conventional Winograd algorithm cannot be directly applied
to AdderNets since the distributive law in multiplication is not valid for the
l1-norm. Therefore, we replace the element-wise multiplication in the Winograd
equation by additions and then develop a new set of transform matrixes that can
enhance the representation ability of output features to maintain the
performance. Moreover, we propose the l2-to-l1 training strategy to mitigate
the negative impacts caused by formal inconsistency. Experimental results on
both FPGA and benchmarks show that the new method can further reduce the energy
consumption without affecting the accuracy of the original AdderNet.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05382">CCN GAC Workshop: Issues with learning in biological recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:2105.05382v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>This perspective piece came about through the Generative Adversarial
Collaboration (GAC) series of workshops organized by the Computational
Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) conference in 2020. We brought together a number
of experts from the field of theoretical neuroscience to debate emerging issues
in our understanding of how learning is implemented in biological recurrent
neural networks. Here, we will give a brief review of the common assumptions
about biological learning and the corresponding findings from experimental
neuroscience and contrast them with the efficiency of gradient-based learning
in recurrent neural networks commonly used in artificial intelligence. We will
then outline the key issues discussed in the workshop: synaptic plasticity,
neural circuits, theory-experiment divide, and objective functions. Finally, we
conclude with recommendations for both theoretical and experimental
neuroscientists when designing new studies that could help to bring clarity to
these issues.

<p>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. Genetic forms of FTLD and ALS are caused by pathogenic variants in various genes, such as PGRN (progranulin). To date, depletion of parkin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a key mitophagy regulator, has been reported in sporadic ALS patients and ALS mice models with TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this work, we show parkin downregulation also in fibroblasts derived from FTLD patients with four different PGRN pathogenic variants. We corroborate this finding in control fibroblasts upon PGRN silencing, demonstrating additionally the decrease of parkin downstream targets, mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). Importantly, we show that TDP-43 overexpression rescues PRKN levels upon transient PGRN silencing, but not in FTLD fibroblasts with PGRN pathogenic variants, despite upregulating PGRN levels in both cases. Further observation of PRKN downregulation upon TDP-43 silencing, suggests that TDP-43 loss-of-function contributes to PRKN decrease. Our results provide further evidence that parkin downregulation might be a common and systemic phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases with TDP- 43 loss-of-function.</p>

<p>A common hypothesis explains autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in neuronal network connectivity. Mutation of genes including Met and downstream signaling components, e.g., PTEN, Tsc2 and, Rheb are involved in the control of synapse formation and stabilization and were all considered as risk genes for ASD. While the impact of Met on glutamatergic synapses was widely appreciated, its contribution to the stability of inhibitory, GABAergic synapses is poorly understood. The stabilization of GABAergic synapses depends on clustering of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we show in vivo and in vitro that Met is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of GABAergic synapses via induction of gephyrin clustering. Likewise, we provide evidence for Met-dependent gephyrin clustering via activation of mTOR. Our results support the notion that deficient GABAergic signaling represents a pathomechanism for ASD.</p>

<p>Accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are constituted of abnormally phosphorylated tau, is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The oligomeric aggregates of tau in AD brain (AD O-tau) are believed to trigger NFT spreading by seeding normal tau aggregation as toxic seeds, in a prion-like fashion. Here, we revealed the features of AD O-tau by Western blots using antibodies against various epitopes and determined the effect of dephosphorylation on the seeding activity of AD O-tau by capture and seeded aggregation assays. We found that N-terminal truncated and C-terminalhyperphosphorylated tau species were enriched in AD O-tau. Dephosphorylation of AD O-tau by alkaline phosphatasediminished its activity in capturing tau in vitro and ininducing insoluble aggregates in cultured cells. Our resultssuggested that dephosphorylation passivated the seeding activity ofAD O-tau. Inhibition of phosphorylation may be a potentstrategy to prevent the spreading of tau patho3logy.</p>

Purpose<p>To investigate whether combining multiple radiomics signatures derived from the subregions of glioblastoma (GBM) can improve survival prediction of patients with GBM.</p>Methods<p>In total, 129 patients were included in this study and split into training (n = 99) and test (n = 30) cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from each tumor region then radiomics scores were obtained separately using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression. A clinical nomogram was also constructed using various clinical risk factors. Radiomics nomograms were constructed by combing a single radiomics signature from the whole tumor region with clinical risk factors or combining three radiomics signatures from three tumor subregions with clinical risk factors. The performance of these models was assessed by the discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness metrics, and was compared with that of the clinical nomogram.</p>Results<p>Incorporating the three radiomics signatures, i.e., Radscores for ET, NET, and ED, into the radiomics-based nomogram improved the performance in estimating survival (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.717/0.655) compared with that of the clinical nomogram (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.633/0.560) and that of the radiomics nomogram based on single region radiomics signatures (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.656/0.535).</p>Conclusion<p>The multiregional radiomics nomogram exhibited a favorable survival stratification accuracy.</p>

<p>Since each individual subject may present completely different encephalogram (EEG) patterns with respect to other subjects, existing subject-independent emotion classifiers trained on data sampled from cross-subjects or cross-dataset generally fail to achieve sound accuracy. In this scenario, the domain adaptation technique could be employed to address this problem, which has recently got extensive attention due to its effectiveness on cross-distribution learning. Focusing on cross-subject or cross-dataset automated emotion recognition with EEG features, we propose in this article a robust multi-source co-adaptation framework by mining diverse correlation information (MACI) among domains and features with l<sub>2,1</sub>−norm as well as correlation metric regularization. Specifically, by minimizing the statistical and semantic distribution differences between source and target domains, multiple subject-invariant classifiers can be learned together in a joint framework, which can make MACI use relevant knowledge from multiple sources by exploiting the developed correlation metric function. Comprehensive experimental evidence on DEAP and SEED datasets verifies the better performance of MACI in EEG-based emotion recognition.</p>

<p>Accumulating diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) evidence suggests that white matter abnormalities evaluated by local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) or fractional anisotropy (FA) occur in patients with blepharospasm (BSP), both of which are significantly correlated with disease severity. However, whether the individual severity of BSP can be identified using these DTI metrics remains unknown. We aimed to investigate whether a combination of machine learning techniques and LDH or FA can accurately identify the individual severity of BSP. Forty-one patients with BSP were assessed using the Jankovic Rating Scale and DTI. The patients were assigned to non-functionally and functionally limited groups according to their Jankovic Rating Scale scores. A machine learning scheme consisting of beam search and support vector machines was designed to identify non-functionally versus functionally limited outcomes, with the input features being LDH or FA in 68 white matter regions. The proposed machine learning scheme with LDH or FA yielded an overall accuracy of 88.67 versus 85.19% in identifying non-functionally limited versus functionally limited outcomes. The scheme also identified a sensitivity of 91.40 versus 85.87% in correctly identifying functionally limited outcomes, a specificity of 83.33 versus 83.67% in accurately identifying non-functionally limited outcomes, and an area under the curve of 93.7 versus 91.3%. These findings suggest that a combination of LDH or FA measurements and a sophisticated machine learning scheme can accurately and reliably identify the individual disease severity in patients with BSP.</p>

<p>Voltage imaging with fluorescent dyes affords the opportunity to map neuronal activity in both time and space. One limitation to imaging is the inability to image complete neuronal networks: some fraction of cells remains outside of the observation window. Here, we combine voltage imaging, post hoc immunocytochemistry, and patterned microisland hippocampal culture to provide imaging of complete neuronal ensembles. The patterned microislands completely fill the field of view of our high-speed (500 Hz) camera, enabling reconstruction of the spiking patterns of every single neuron in the network. Cultures raised on microislands are similar to neurons grown on coverslips, with parallel developmental trajectories and composition of inhibitory and excitatory cell types (CA1, CA3, and dentate granule cells, or DGC). We calculate the likelihood that action potential firing in one neuron triggers action potential firing in a downstream neuron in a spontaneously active network to construct a functional connection map of these neuronal ensembles. Importantly, this functional map indicates preferential connectivity between DGC and CA3 neurons and between CA3 and CA1 neurons, mimicking the neuronal circuitry of the intact hippocampus. We envision that patterned microislands, in combination with voltage imaging and methods to classify cell types, will be a powerful method for exploring neuronal function in both healthy and disease states. Additionally, because the entire neuronal network is sampled simultaneously, this strategy has the power to go further, revealing all functional connections between all cell types.</p>

<p>The ability to optically record dynamics of neuronal membrane potential promises to revolutionize our understanding of neurobiology. In this study, we show that the far-red voltage sensitive fluorophore, Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential-1, or BeRST 1, can be used to monitor neuronal membrane potential changes across dozens of neurons at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Notably, voltage imaging with BeRST 1 can be implemented with affordable, commercially available illumination sources, optics, and detectors. BeRST 1 is well-tolerated in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and provides exceptional optical recording fidelity, as judged by dual fluorescence imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology. We developed a semi-automated spike-picking program to reduce user bias when calling action potentials and used this in conjunction with BeRST 1 to develop an optical spike and connectivity analysis (OSCA) for high-throughput dissection of neuronal activity dynamics. The high temporal resolution of BeRST 1 enables dissection of firing rate changes in response to acute, pharmacological interventions with commonly used inhibitors like gabazine and picrotoxin. Over longer periods of time, BeRST 1 also tracks chronic perturbations to neurons exposed to amyloid beta 1–42 (Aβ <sup>1–42</sup>), revealing modest changes to spiking frequency but profound changes to overall network connectivity. Finally, we use OSCA to track changes in neuronal connectivity during maturation in culture, providing a functional readout of network assembly. We envision that use of BeRST 1 and OSCA described here will be of use to the broad neuroscience community.</p>

<p>Magnetometry based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is a novel technique capable of measuring magnetic fields with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. With the further advancements of these sensors, they may open up novel approaches for the 2D imaging of neural signals in vitro. In the present study, we investigate the feasibility of NV-based imaging by numerically simulating the magnetic signal from the auditory pathway of a rodent brainstem slice (ventral cochlear nucleus, VCN, to the medial trapezoid body, MNTB) as stimulated by both electric and optic stimulation. The resulting signal from these two stimulation methods are evaluated and compared. A realistic pathway model was created based on published data of the neural morphologies and channel dynamics of the globular bushy cells in the VCN and their axonal projections to the principal cells in the MNTB. The pathway dynamics in response to optic and electric stimulation and the emitted magnetic fields were estimated using the cable equation. For simulating the optic stimulation, the light distribution in brain tissue was numerically estimated and used to model the optogenetic neural excitation based on a four state channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) model. The corresponding heating was also estimated, using the bio-heat equation and was found to be low (&lt;2°C) even at excessively strong optic signals. A peak magnetic field strength of ∼0.5 and ∼0.1 nT was calculated from the auditory brainstem pathway after electrical and optical stimulation, respectively. By increasing the stimulating light intensity four-fold (far exceeding commonly used intensities) the peak magnetic signal strength only increased to 0.2 nT. Thus, while optogenetic stimulation would be favorable to avoid artefacts in the recordings, electric stimulation achieves higher peak fields. The present simulation study predicts that high-resolution magnetic imaging of the action potentials traveling along the auditory brainstem pathway will only be possible for next generation NV sensors. However, the existing sensors already have sufficient sensitivity to support the magnetic sensing of cumulated neural signals sampled from larger parts of the pathway, which might be a promising intermediate step toward further maturing this novel technology.</p>

<p>In quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), reconstructed results can be critically biased by misinterpreted or missing phase data near the edges of the brain support originating from the non-local relationship between field and susceptibility. These data either have to be excluded or corrected before further processing can take place. To address this, our iterative restoration of the fringe phase (REFRASE) approach simultaneously enhances the accuracy of multi-echo phase data QSM maps and the extent of the area available for evaluation. Data loss caused by strong local phase gradients near the surface of the brain support is recovered within the original phase data using harmonic and dipole-based fields extrapolated from a robust support region toward an extended brain mask. Over several iterations, phase data are rectified prior to the application of further QSM processing steps. The concept is successfully validated on numerical phantoms and brain scans from a cohort of volunteers. The increased extent of the mask and improved numerical stability within the segmented globus pallidus confirm the efficacy of the presented method in comparison to traditional evaluation.</p>

<p>A core feature of drug-resistant epilepsy is hyperexcitability in the motor cortex, and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a suitable treatment for seizures. However, the antiepileptic effect causing network reorganization has rarely been studied. Here, we assessed the impact of rTMS on functional network connectivity (FNC) in resting functional networks (RSNs) and their relation to treatment response. Fourteen patients with medically intractable epilepsy received inhibitive rTMS with a figure-of-eight coil over the vertex for 10 days spread across two weeks. We designed a 6-week follow-up phase divided into four time points to investigate FNC and rTMS-induced timing-dependent plasticity, such as seizure frequency and abnormal interictal discharges on electroencephalography (EEG). For psychiatric comorbidities, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were applied to measure depression and anxiety before and after rTMS. FNC was also compared to that of a cohort of 17 healthy control subjects. The after-effects of rTMS included all subjects that achieved the significant decrease rate of more than 50% in interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure frequency, 12 (14) patients with the reduction rate above 50% compared to the baseline, as well as emotional improvements in depression and anxiety (p &lt; 0.05). In the analysis of RSNs, we found a higher synchronization between the sensorimotor network (SMN) and posterior default-mode network (pDMN) in epileptic patients than in healthy controls. In contrast to pre-rTMS, the results demonstrated a weaker FNC between the anterior DMN (aDMN) and SMN after rTMS, while the FNC between the aDMN and dorsal attention network (DAN) was greater (p &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Importantly, the depressive score was anticorrelated with the FNC of the aDMN-SMN (r = −0.67, p = 0.0022), which was markedly different in the good and bad response groups treated with rTMS (p = 0.0115). Based on the vertex suppression by rTMS, it is possible to achieve temporary clinical efficacy by modulating network reorganization in the DMN and SMN for patients with refractory epilepsy.</p>

<p>Background: Benzodiazepines have been widely used in clinical practice for over four decades and continue to be one of the most consumed and highly prescribed class of drugs available in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The literature indicates that Benzodiazepine users at a significantly increased risk of Motor Vehicle accidents compared to non-users but the impact on injuries at workplace is not well-defined. We aimed to investigate whether use of benzodiazepine is associated with increased risk of occupational injuries (OI).</p><p>Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) among case controls, cross-sectional studies, either questionnaire or laboratory exams based.</p><p>Results: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria, involving 324,168 OI from seven different countries, with an estimated occurrence of benzodiazepine positivity of 2.71% (95% CI 1.45–4.98). A total of 14 estimates were retrieved. Of them, 10 were based on laboratory analyses, three on institutional databases, while one study was based on questionnaires. Regarding the occupational groups, three estimates focused on commercial drivers (0.73%, 95% CI 0.12–4.30), that exhibited a reduced risk ratio for benzodiazepine positivity compared to other occupational groups (RR 0.109, 95% CI 0.063–0.187). Eventually, no increased risk for benzodiazepine positivity was identified, either from case control studies (OR 1.520, 95% CI 0.801–2.885, I<sup>2</sup> 76%), or cross sectional studies, when only laboratory based estimates were taken in account (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.253–1.377, I<sup>2</sup> 63%).</p><p>Conclusions: Even though benzodiazepines have the potential to increase injury rates among casual and chronic users, available evidence are insufficient to sustain this hypothesis, particularly when focusing on laboratory-based studies (i.e., studies the characterized the benzodiazepine immediately before the event).</p>

<p>The claustrum is a thin sheet of neurons that is densely connected to many cortical regions and has been implicated in numerous high-order brain functions. Such brain functions arise from brain states that are influenced by neuromodulatory pathways from the cholinergic basal forebrain, dopaminergic substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and serotonergic raphe. Recent revelations that the claustrum receives dense input from these structures have inspired investigation of state-dependent control of the claustrum. Here, we review neuromodulation in the claustrum—from anatomical connectivity to behavioral manipulations—to inform future analyses of claustral function.</p>

<p>Wide-field Optical Imaging of Intrinsic Signals (OI-IS; Grinvald et al., 1986) is a method for imaging functional brain hemodynamic responses, mainly used to image activity from the surface of the cerebral cortex. It localizes small functional modules – such as cortical columns – with great spatial resolution and spatial specificity relative to the site of increases in neuronal activity. OI-IS is capable of imaging responses either through an intact or thinned skull or following a craniotomy. Therefore, it is minimally invasive, which makes it ideal for survival experiments. Here we describe OI-IS-based methods for guiding microinjections of optogenetics viral vectors in proximity to small functional modules (S1 barrels) of the cerebral cortex and for guiding the insertion of electrodes for electrophysiological recording into such modules. We validate our proposed methods by tissue processing of the cerebral barrel field area, revealing the track of the electrode in a predetermined barrel. In addition, we demonstrate the use of optical imaging to visualize the spatial extent of the optogenetics photostimulation, making it possible to estimate one of the two variables that conjointly determine which region of the brain is stimulated. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of OI-IS at high-magnification for imaging the upper recording contacts of a laminar probe, making it possible to estimate the insertion depth of all contacts relative to the surface of the cortex. These methods support the precise positioning of microinjections and recording electrodes, thus overcoming the variability in the spatial position of fine-scale functional modules.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is a devastating neuropsychiatric disease with a globally 1% life-long prevalence. Clinical studies have linked Zswim6 mutations to developmental and neurological diseases, including schizophrenia. Zswim6’s function remains largely unknown. Given the involvement of Zswim6 in schizophrenia and schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disease, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Zswim6 in the developing brain. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Zswim6 in the mouse forebrain by in situ hybridization with radioactive and non-radioactive-labeled riboprobes. Zswim6 mRNA was detected as early as E11.5 in the ventral forebrain. At E11.5–E13.5, Zswim6 was highly expressed in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). The LGE consisted of two progenitor populations. Dlx<sup>+</sup>;Er81<sup>+</sup> cells in dorsal LGE comprised progenitors of olfactory bulb interneurons, whereas Dlx<sup>+</sup>;Isl1<sup>+</sup> progenitors in ventral LGE gave rise to striatal projection neurons. Zswim6 was not colocalized with Er81 in the dorsal LGE. In the ventral LGE, Zswim6 was colocalized with striatal progenitor marker Nolz-1. Zswim6 was highly expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of LGE in which progenitors undergo the transition from proliferation to differentiation. Double labeling showed that Zswim6 was not colocalized with proliferation marker Ki67 but was colocalized with differentiation marker Tuj1 in the SVZ, suggesting Zswim6 expression in early differentiating neurons. Zswim6 was also expressed in the adjacent structures of medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE, CGE) that contained progenitors of cortical interneurons. At E15.5 and E17.5, Zswim6 was expressed in several key brain regions that were involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, including the striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and medial habenular nucleus. Zswim6 was persistently expressed in the postnatal brain. Cell type analysis indicated that Zswim6 mRNA was colocalized with D1R-expressing striatonigral and D2R-expressing striatopallidal neurons of the adult striatum with a higher colocalization in striatopallidal neurons. These findings are of particular interest as striatal dopamine D2 receptors are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In summary, the comprehensive analysis provides an anatomical framework for the study of Zswim6 function and Zswim6-associated neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Context: Cognitive impairments are common in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are heterogeneous in their presentation. The “dual syndrome hypothesis” suggests the existence of two distinct subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD: a frontostriatal subtype with predominant attentional and/or executive deficits and a posterior cortical subtype with predominant visuospatial, memory, and/or language deficits. The latter subtype has been associated with a higher risk of developing dementia.</p><p>Objective: The objective of this study was to identify structural modifications in cortical and subcortical regions associated with each PD-MCI subtype.</p><p>Methods: One-hundred and fourteen non-demented PD patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment as well as a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan. Patients were categorized as having no cognitive impairment (n = 41) or as having a frontostriatal (n = 16), posterior cortical (n = 25), or a mixed (n = 32) MCI subtype. Cortical regions were analyzed using a surface-based Cortical thickness (CTh) method. In addition, the volumes, shapes, and textures of the caudate nuclei, hippocampi, and thalami were studied. Tractometric analyses were performed on associative and commissural white matter (WM) tracts.</p><p>Results: There were no between-group differences in volumetric measurements and cortical thickness. Shape analyses revealed more abundant and more extensive deformations fields in the caudate nuclei, hippocampi, and thalami in patients with posterior cortical deficits compared to patients with no cognitive impairment. Decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) were also observed in the superior longitudinal fascicle, the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, the striato-parietal tract, and the anterior and posterior commissural tracts. Texture analyses showed a significant difference in the right hippocampus of patients with a mixed MCI subtype.</p><p>Conclusion: PD-MCI patients with posterior cortical deficits have more abundant and more extensive structural alterations independently of age, disease duration, and severity, which may explain why they have an increased risk of dementia.</p>

<p>Objectives: In recent years several <sup>18</sup>F-labeled amyloid PET (Aβ-PET) tracers have been developed and have obtained clinical approval. There is evidence that Aβ-PET perfusion can provide surrogate information about neuronal injury in neurodegenerative diseases when compared to conventional blood flow and glucose metabolism assessment. However, this paradigm has not yet been tested in neurodegenerative disorders with cortical and subcortical affection. Therefore, we investigated the performance of early acquisition <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol Aβ-PET in comparison to <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in corticobasal syndrome (CBS).</p><p>Methods: Subjects with clinically possible or probable CBS were recruited within the prospective Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (ActiGliA) observational study and all CBS cases with an available FDG-PET prior to Aβ-PET were selected. Aβ-PET was acquired 0–10 min p.i. (early-phase) and 90–110 min p.i. (late-phase) whereas FDG-PET was recorded statically from 30 to 50 min p.i. Semiquantitative regional values and asymmetry indices (AI) were compared between early-phase Aβ-PET and FDG-PET. Visual assessments of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism were compared between both methods. Late-phase Aβ-PET was evaluated visually for assessment of Aβ-positivity.</p><p>Results: Among 20 evaluated patients with CBS, 5 were Aβ-positive. Early-phase Aβ-PET and FDG-PET SUVr correlated highly in cortical (mean R = 0.86, range 0.77–0.92) and subcortical brain regions (mean R = 0.84, range 0.79–0.90). Strong asymmetry was observed in FDG-PET for the motor cortex (mean |AI| = 2.9%), the parietal cortex (mean |AI| = 2.9%), and the thalamus (mean |AI| = 5.5%), correlating well with AI of early-phase Aβ-PET (mean R = 0.87, range 0.62–0.98). Visual assessments of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism were highly congruent.</p><p>Conclusion: Early-phase Aβ-PET facilitates assessment of neuronal injury in CBS for cortical and subcortical areas. Known asymmetries in CBS are captured by this method, enabling assessment of Aβ-status and neuronal injury with a single radiation exposure at a single visit.</p>

Background<p>It remains unclear why patients with young-onset Parkinson’s disease more often develop levo-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa)-induced dyskinesia (LID) and have a more severe form than patients with old-onset Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies using animal models have failed to show young-onset Parkinson’s disease enhances LID.</p>Objectives<p>To evaluate the association of age at dopaminergic denervation (onset age) and initiation of L-dopa treatment (treatment age) with LID development in model rats.</p>Methods<p>We established rat models of young- and old-lesioned Parkinson’s disease (6-hydroxydopamine lesions at 10 and 88 weeks of age, respectively). Dopaminergic denervation was confirmed by the rotational behavior test using apomorphine. Rats in the young-lesioned group were allocated to either L-dopa treatment at a young or old age, or saline treatment. Rats in the old-lesioned group were allocated to either L-dopa treatment or saline group. We evaluated L-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements during the 14-day treatment period. We also examined preprodynorphin mRNA expression in the striatum (a neurochemical hallmark of LID) and the volume of the medial globus pallidus (a pathological hallmark of LID).</p>Results<p>LID-like behavior was enhanced in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats compared with L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. Preprodynorphin mRNA expression was higher in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats than in in L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. The volume of the medial globus pallidus was greater in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats than in L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. Treatment age did not affect LID-like behavior or the degree of medial globus pallidus hypertrophy in the young-lesioned model.</p>Conclusion<p>Both dopaminergic denervation and L-dopa initiation at a young age contributed to the development of LID; however, the former may be a more important factor.</p>

<p>Background: Identification of early modifiable factors is crucial to delay or prevent the development of cognitive impairment and reduce the social and economic burden.</p><p>Objective: This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations of childhood neighborhood quality (CNQ) with the risk of later-life cognitive dysfunction and the role of body mass index (BMI) in this association.</p><p>Methods: A total of 8,289 community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly population from wave 2011, wave 2013, and wave 2015 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were included. Cognitive function and CNQ were measured by standardized questionnaires. Multilevel linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of CNQ and cognitive function. The interactions of BMI with CNQ in the progress of cognitive function were also estimated.</p><p>Results: The participants with higher CNQ had a significantly low risk of cognitive impairment than those with lower CNQ score (β = 0.067, 95% CI: 0.031, 0.103), and the results remained similar (β = 0.039, 95% CI: 0.004, 0.075) after controlling other confounding variables. Furthermore, there was an interaction between BMI with CNQ score (P &lt; 0.001) for the risk of cognitive impairment. In BMI-stratified analysis, we found that the association of CNQ and cognitive function was not statistically significant in overweight or obese population (β = 0.019, 95% CI: −0.032, 0.070), but was statistically significant in people with lower BMI (β = 0.059, 95% CI: 0.010, 0.107).</p><p>Conclusions: Higher CNQ score is significantly associated with the lower risk of cognitive dysfunction in adulthood.

Background<p>Abnormal cholesterol metabolism is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and causes dementia. Cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) and maintains cholesterol homeostasis in the brain.</p>Objective<p>This study aimed to investigate the roles of 24-OHC and the CYP46A1 (rs754203) polymorphism in patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p>Methods<p>A total of 193 Chinese patients with T2DM were recruited into two groups according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical data were collected, and neuropsychological tests were conducted. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seqnome method were used to detect the concentration of plasma 24-OHC and the CYP46A1 rs754203 genotype, respectively.</p>Results<p>Compared with 118 healthy cognition participants, patients with MCI (n = 75) displayed a higher plasma level of 24-OHC and total cholesterol concentration (all p = 0.031), while no correlation was found between them. In the overall diabetes population, the plasma level of 24-OHC was negatively correlated with MoCA (r = −0.150, p = 0.039), and it was further proved to be an independent risk factor of diabetic MCI (OR = 1.848, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients with MCI and the CC genotype of CYP46A1 rs754203 showed the highest plasma level of 24-OHC even though the difference was not statistically significant, and they obtained low scores in both the verbal fluency test and Stroop color and word test A (p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively).</p>Conclusion<p>In patients with T2DM, high plasma level of 24-OHC and the CC genotype carrier of CYP46A1 rs754203 may portend a high risk of developing early cognitive impairment, including attention and executive deficits.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68041">Dopamine differentially modulates the size of projection neuron ensembles in the intact and dopamine-depleted striatum</a></h4>

Dopamine (DA) is a critical modulator of brain circuits that control voluntary movements, but our understanding of its influence on the activity of target neurons <i>in vivo</i> remains limited. Here, we use two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the activity of direct and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) simultaneously in the striatum of behaving mice during acute and prolonged manipulations of DA signaling. We find that increasing and decreasing DA biases striatal activity towards the direct and indirect pathways, respectively, by changing the overall number of SPNs recruited during behavior in a manner not predicted by existing models of DA function. This modulation is drastically altered in a model of Parkinson's disease. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated population-level influence of DA on striatal output and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67340">The effect of host community functional traits on plant disease risk varies along an elevational gradient</a></h4>

Quantifying the relative impact of environmental conditions and host community structure on disease is one of the greatest challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, as both climate and biodiversity are changing at unprecedented rates. Both increasing temperature and shifting host communities towards more fast-paced life-history strategies are predicted to increase disease, yet their independent and interactive effects on disease in natural communities remains unknown. Here, we address this challenge by surveying foliar disease symptoms in 220, 0.5 meter-diameter herbaceous plant communities along a 1100-meter elevational gradient. We find that increasing temperature associated with lower elevation can increase disease by (1) relaxing constraints on parasite growth and reproduction, (2) determining which host species are present in a given location, and (3) strengthening the positive effect of host community pace-of-life on disease. These results provide the first field evidence, under natural conditions, that environmental gradients can alter how host community structure affects disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65234">A non-genetic, cell cycle dependent mechanism of platinum resistance in lung adenocarcinoma</a></h4>

We previously used a pulse-based <i>in vitro </i>assay to unveil targetable signalling pathways associated with innate cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma (Hastings et al., 2020). Here we advanced this model system and identified a non-genetic mechanism of resistance that drives recovery and regrowth in a subset of cells. Using RNAseq and a suite of biosensors to track single cell fates both <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo,</i> we identified that early S phase cells have a greater ability to maintain proliferative capacity, which correlated with reduced DNA damage over multiple generations. In contrast, cells in G1, late S or those treated with PARP/RAD51 inhibitors, maintained higher levels of DNA damage and underwent prolonged S/G2 phase arrest and senescence. Combined with our previous work, these data indicate that there is a non-genetic mechanism of resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma that is dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of cisplatin exposure.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64674">Propensity for somatic expansion increases over the course of life in Huntington disease</a></h4>

Recent work on Huntington disease (HD) suggests that somatic instability of CAG repeat tracts, which can expand into the hundreds in neurons, explains clinical outcomes better than the length of the inherited allele. Here, we measured somatic expansion in blood samples collected from the same 50 HD mutation carriers over a twenty-year period, along with post-mortem tissue from 15 adults and 7 fetal mutation carriers, to examine somatic expansions at different stages of life. Post-mortem brains, as previously reported, had the greatest expansions, but fetal cortex had virtually none. Somatic instability in blood increased with age, despite blood cells being short-lived compared to neurons, and was driven mostly by CAG repeat length, then by age at sampling and by interaction between these two variables. Expansion rates were higher in symptomatic subjects. These data lend support to a previously proposed computational model of somatic instability-driven disease.

<i>ARID1A</i> is one of the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulators in a wide spectrum of cancers. Recent studies have shown that <i>ARID1A</i> deficiency induces global changes in the epigenetic landscape of enhancers and promoters. These broad and complex effects make it challenging to identify the driving mechanisms of <i>ARID1A</i> deficiency in promoting cancer progression. Here, we identified the anti-senescence effect of <i>Arid1a </i>deficiency in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) by profiling the transcriptome of individual PanINs in a mouse model. In a human cell line model, we found that <i>ARID1A</i> deficiency upregulates the expression of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A1 (<i>ALDH1A1</i>), which plays an essential role in attenuating the senescence induced by oncogenic KRAS through scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, our ATAC sequencing data showed that <i>ARID1A </i>deficiency increases the accessibility of the enhancer region of <i>ALDH1A1</i>. This study provides the first evidence that <i>ARID1A</i> deficiency promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis by attenuating <i>KRAS</i>-induced senescence through the upregulation of <i>ALDH1A1 </i>expression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63425">Sex differences in biological aging with a focus on human studies</a></h4>

Aging is a complex biological process characterized by hallmark features accumulating over the life course, shaping the individual's aging trajectory and subsequent disease risks. There is substantial individual variability in the aging process between men and women. In general, women live longer than men, consistent with lower biological ages as assessed by molecular biomarkers, but there is a paradox. Women are frailer and have worse health at the end of life, while men still perform better in physical function examinations. Moreover, many age-related diseases show sex-specific patterns. In this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on sexual dimorphism in human studies, with support from animal research, on biological aging and illnesses. We also attempt to place it in the context of the theories of aging, as well as discuss the explanations for the sex differences, for example, the sex-chromosome linked mechanisms and hormonally driven differences.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63392">Permeabilization-free <i>en bloc</i> immunohistochemistry for correlative microscopy</a></h4>

A dense reconstruction of neuronal synaptic connectivity typically requires high-resolution 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, but EM data alone lacks functional information about neurons and synapses. One approach to augment structural EM datasets is with the fluorescent immunohistochemical (IHC) localization of functionally relevant proteins. We describe a protocol that obviates the requirement of tissue permeabilization in thick tissue sections, a major impediment for correlative pre-embedding IHC and EM. We demonstrate the permeabilization-free labeling of neuronal cell types, intracellular enzymes, and synaptic proteins in tissue sections hundreds of microns thick in multiple brain regions from mice while simultaneously retaining the ultrastructural integrity of the tissue. Finally, we explore the utility of this protocol by performing proof-of-principle correlative experiments combining two-photon imaging of protein distributions and 3D EM.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62929">Bundle-specific associations between white matter microstructure and Aβ and tau pathology in preclinical Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

Beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau proteins, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are believed to spread through connected regions of the brain. Combining diffusion imaging and positron emission tomography, we investigated associations between white matter microstructure specifically in bundles connecting regions where Aβ or tau accumulates and pathology. We focussed on free-water corrected diffusion measures in the anterior cingulum, posterior cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus in cognitively normal older adults at risk of sporadic AD and presymptomatic mutation carriers of autosomal dominant AD. In Aβ-positive or tau-positive groups, lower tissue fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity related to greater Aβ and tau burden in both cohorts. Associations were found in the posterior cingulum and uncinate fasciculus in preclinical sporadic AD, and in the anterior and posterior cingulum in presymptomatic mutation carriers. These results suggest that microstructural alterations accompany pathological accumulation as early as the preclinical stage of both sporadic and autosomal dominant AD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62084">Rapid adaptation of endocytosis, exocytosis and eisosomes after an acute increase in membrane tension in yeast cells</a></h4>

During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in eukaryotes, actin assembly is required to overcome large membrane tension and turgor pressure. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the actin machinery adapts to varying membrane tension remain unknown. In addition, how cells reduce their membrane tension when they are challenged by hypotonic shocks remains unclear. We used quantitative microscopy to demonstrate that cells rapidly reduce their membrane tension using three parallel mechanisms. In addition to using their cell wall for mechanical protection, yeast cells disassemble eisosomes to buffer moderate changes in membrane tension on a minute time scale. Meanwhile, a temporary reduction of the rate of endocytosis for 2 to 6 minutes, and an increase in the rate of exocytosis for at least 5 minutes allow cells to add large pools of membrane to the plasma membrane. We built on these results to submit the cells to abrupt increases in membrane tension and determine that the endocytic actin machinery of fission yeast cells rapidly adapts to perform clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our study sheds light on the tight connection between membrane tension regulation, endocytosis and exocytosis.

<p>by Nikolina ŠoŠtarić, Vera van Noort</p>

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a vital, yet often overlooked role in the living cells through modulation of protein properties, such as localization and affinity towards their interactors, thereby enabling quick adaptation to changing environmental conditions. We have previously benchmarked a computational framework for the prediction of PTMs’ effects on the stability of protein-protein interactions, which has molecular dynamics simulations followed by free energy calculations at its core. In the present work, we apply this framework to publicly available data on <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> protein structures and PTM sites, identified in both normal and stress conditions. We predict proteome-wide effects of acetylations and phosphorylations on protein-protein interactions and find that acetylations more frequently have locally stabilizing roles in protein interactions, while the opposite is true for phosphorylations. However, the overall impact of PTMs on protein-protein interactions is more complex than a simple sum of local changes caused by the introduction of PTMs and adds to our understanding of PTM cross-talk. We further use the obtained data to calculate the conformational changes brought about by PTMs. Finally, conservation of the analyzed PTM residues in orthologues shows that some predictions for yeast proteins will be mirrored to other organisms, including human. This work, therefore, contributes to our overall understanding of the modulation of the cellular protein interaction networks in yeast and beyond.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NDOhPt9osPI" width="1" />

Genomic data analysis across multiple cloud platforms is an ongoing challenge, especially when large amounts of data are involved. Here, we present Swarm, a framework for federated computation that promotes minimal data motion and facilitates crosstalk between genomic datasets stored on various cloud platforms. We demonstrate its utility via common inquiries of genomic variants across BigQuery in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Athena in the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Presto and MySQL. Compared to single-cloud platforms, the Swarm framework significantly reduced computational costs, run-time delays and risks of security breach and privacy violation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D1mtzG98xz8" width="1" />

<p>by Alan Eric Akil, Robert Rosenbaum, Krešimir Josić</p>

The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated. Dynamic excitatory–inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How do the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a theory of spike–timing dependent plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity–induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E7BoTvQVsEI" width="1" />

<p>by Marco António Dias Louro, Mónica Bettencourt-Dias, Claudia Bank</p>

The presence of extra centrioles, termed centrosome amplification, is a hallmark of cancer. The distribution of centriole numbers within a cancer cell population appears to be at an equilibrium maintained by centriole overproduction and selection, reminiscent of mutation-selection balance. It is unknown to date if the interaction between centriole overproduction and selection can quantitatively explain the intra- and inter-population heterogeneity in centriole numbers. Here, we define mutation-selection-like models and employ a model selection approach to infer patterns of centriole overproduction and selection in a diverse panel of human cell lines. Surprisingly, we infer strong and uniform selection against any number of extra centrioles in most cell lines. Finally we assess the accuracy and precision of our inference method and find that it increases non-linearly as a function of the number of sampled cells. We discuss the biological implications of our results and how our methodology can inform future experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/THJjMqxeT7s" width="1" />

<p>by Jean-Paul Noel, Ling-Qi Zhang, Alan A. Stocker, Dora E. Angelaki</p>

Perceptual anomalies in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been attributed to an imbalance in weighting incoming sensory evidence with prior knowledge when interpreting sensory information. Here, we show that sensory encoding and how it adapts to changing stimulus statistics during feedback also characteristically differs between neurotypical and ASD groups. In a visual orientation estimation task, we extracted the accuracy of sensory encoding from psychophysical data by using an information theoretic measure. Initially, sensory representations in both groups reflected the statistics of visual orientations in natural scenes, but encoding capacity was overall lower in the ASD group. Exposure to an artificial (i.e., uniform) distribution of visual orientations coupled with performance feedback altered the sensory representations of the neurotypical group toward the novel experimental statistics, while also increasing their total encoding capacity. In contrast, neither total encoding capacity nor its allocation significantly changed in the ASD group. Across both groups, the degree of adaptation was correlated with participants’ initial encoding capacity. These findings highlight substantial deficits in sensory encoding—independent from and potentially in addition to deficits in decoding—in individuals with ASD.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ncwIQm29wk" width="1" />

Melanin, a black-brown pigment found throughout all kingdoms of life, has diverse biological functions including UV protection, thermoregulation, oxidant scavenging, arthropod immunity, and microbial virulence. Given melanin’s broad roles in the biosphere, particularly in insect immune defenses, it is important to understand how exposure to ubiquitous environmental contaminants affects melanization. Glyphosate—the most widely used herbicide globally—inhibits melanin production, which could have wide-ranging implications in the health of many organisms, including insects. Here, we demonstrate that glyphosate has deleterious effects on insect health in 2 evolutionary distant species, <i>Galleria mellonella</i> (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting a broad effect in insects. Glyphosate reduced survival of <i>G</i>. <i>mellonella</i> caterpillars following infection with the fungus <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and decreased the size of melanized nodules formed in hemolymph, which normally help eliminate infection. Glyphosate also increased the burden of the malaria-causing parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in <i>A</i>. <i>gambiae</i> mosquitoes, altered uninfected mosquito survival, and perturbed the microbial composition of adult mosquito midguts. Our results show that glyphosate’s mechanism of melanin inhibition involves antioxidant synergy and disruption of the reaction oxidation–reduction balance. Overall, these findings suggest that glyphosate’s environmental accumulation could render insects more susceptible to microbial pathogens due to melanin inhibition, immune impairment, and perturbations in microbiota composition, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GZuaIKkRX-w" width="1" />

Although visceral adipocytes located within the body’s central core are maintained at approximately 37°C, adipocytes within bone marrow, subcutaneous, and dermal depots are found primarily within the peripheral shell and generally exist at cooler temperatures. Responses of brown and beige/brite adipocytes to cold stress are well studied; however, comparatively little is known about mechanisms by which white adipocytes adapt to temperatures below 37°C. Here, we report that adaptation of cultured adipocytes to 31°C, the temperature at which distal marrow adipose tissues and subcutaneous adipose tissues often reside, increases anabolic and catabolic lipid metabolism, and elevates oxygen consumption. Cool adipocytes rely less on glucose and more on pyruvate, glutamine, and, especially, fatty acids as energy sources. Exposure of cultured adipocytes and gluteal white adipose tissue (WAT) to cool temperatures activates a shared program of gene expression. Cool temperatures induce stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) expression and monounsaturated lipid levels in cultured adipocytes and distal bone marrow adipose tissues (BMATs), and SCD1 activity is required for acquisition of maximal oxygen consumption at 31°C.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HWca-NFdEDo" width="1" />

Abstract
The objective of the study was to identify brain structures that mediate reward as evidenced by positive reinforcing effects of stimuli on behavior. Testing by intracerebral self‐stimulation enabled monkeys to inform whether activation of ~2900 sites in 74 structures of four sensorimotor pathways and four modulatory loop pathways was positive, negative or neutral. Stimulation was rewarding at 30% of sites, negative at 17%, neutral at 52%. Virtually all (99%) structures yielded some positive or negative sites, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of pathways transmitting valence information. Mapping of sites to structures with dense vs. sparse dopaminergic (DA) or noradrenergic (NA) innervation showed that stimulation of DA‐pathways was rewarding or neutral. Stimulation of NA‐pathways was not rewarding. Stimulation of association areas was generally rewarding; stimulation of purely sensory or motor structures was generally negative. Reward related more to structures’ sensorimotor function than to density of DA‐innervation. Stimulation of basal ganglia loop pathways was rewarding except in lateral globus pallidus, an inhibitory structure in the negative feedback loop; stimulation of the cerebellar loop was rewarding in anterior vermis and the spinocerebellar pathway; and stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 loop was rewarding. While most positive sites were in the DA reward system, numerous sites in sparsely DA‐innervated posterior cingulate and parietal cortices may represent a separate reward system. DA‐density represents concentrations of plastic synapses that mediate acquisition of new synaptic connections. DA‐sparse areas may represent innate, genetically programmed reward‐associated pathways. Implications of findings in regard to response habituation and addiction are discussed.

Objective
Attentional deficits following degeneration of brain cholinergic systems contribute to gait‐balance deficits in Parkinson disease (PD). As a step towards assessing if α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation improves gait‐balance function, we assessed target engagement of the α4β2* nAChR partial agonist varenicline.


Methods
Non‐demented PD participants with cholinergic deficits were identified with [18F]fluoroethoxybenzamicol positron emission tomography (PET). α4β2* nAChR occupancy after subacute oral varenicline treatment was measured with [18F]flubatine PET. With a dose selected from the nAChR occupancy experiment, varenicline effects on gait, balance, and cognition were assessed in a double‐masked placebo‐controlled crossover study. Primary endpoints were normal pace gait speed and a measure of postural stability.


Results
Varenicline doses (0.25 mg per day, 0.25 mg b.i.d., 0.5 mg b.i.d., and 1.0 mg b.i.d.) produced 60% ‐ 70% receptor occupancy. We selected 0.5 mg po b.i.d for the crossover study. Thirty‐three participants completed the crossover study with excellent tolerability. Varenicline had no significant impact on the postural stability measure and caused slower normal pace gait speed. Varenicline narrowed the difference in normal pace gait speed between dual task and no dual task gait conditions, reduced dual task cost, and improved sustained attention test performance. We obtained identical conclusions in 28 participants with treatment compliance confirmed by plasma varenicline measurements.


Interpretation
Varenicline occupied α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, was tolerated well, enhanced attention, and altered gait performance. These results are consistent with target engagement. α4β2* agonists may be worth further evaluation for mitigation of gait and balance disorders in PD.

<p>In this paper, two novel algorithms for features selection are proposed. The
first one is a filter method while the second is wrapper method. Both the
proposed algorithms use the crowding distance used in the multiobjective
optimization as a metric in order to sort the features. The less crowded
features have great effects on the target attribute (class). The experimental
results have shown the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed
algorithms.

<p>The critical brain hypothesis has emerged as an attractive framework to
understand the functional implications of the variability in brain activity.
However, the mechanisms behind the observed emergent collective neural patterns
remain unclear. Here we propose a modeling framework to reconcile apparent
contrasting results. We show that the presence of scale-free neuronal
avalanches and the associated crackling-noise relation can be explained by the
presence of an extrinsic, stochastic-induced mutual information in the system,
whereas the intrinsic spatial correlation structure shows the typical features
of systems close to their critical point. We test our results on data obtained
from the rat's cortex through state-of-the-art multi-array probes.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05002">Prominent characteristics of recurrent neuronal networks are robust against low synaptic weight resolution. (arXiv:2105.05002v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The representation of the natural-density, heterogeneous connectivity of
neuronal network models at relevant spatial scales remains a challenge for
Computational Neuroscience and Neuromorphic Computing. In particular, the
memory demands imposed by the vast number of synapses in brain-scale network
simulations constitutes a major obstacle. Limiting the number resolution of
synaptic weights appears to be a natural strategy to reduce memory and compute
load. In this study, we investigate the effects of a limited synaptic-weight
resolution on the dynamics of recurrent spiking neuronal networks resembling
local cortical circuits, and develop strategies for minimizing deviations from
the dynamics of networks with high-resolution synaptic weights. We mimic the
effect of a limited synaptic weight resolution by replacing normally
distributed synaptic weights by weights drawn from a discrete distribution, and
compare the resulting statistics characterizing firing rates, spike-train
irregularity, and correlation coefficients with the reference solution. We show
that a naive discretization of synaptic weights generally leads to a distortion
of the spike-train statistics. Only if the weights are discretized such that
the mean and the variance of the total synaptic input currents are preserved,
the firing statistics remains unaffected for the types of networks considered
in this study. For networks with sufficiently heterogeneous in-degrees, the
firing statistics can be preserved even if all synaptic weights are replaced by
the mean of the weight distribution. We conclude that even for simple networks
with non-plastic neurons and synapses, a discretization of synaptic weights can
lead to substantial deviations in the firing statistics, unless the
discretization is performed with care and guided by a rigorous validation
process.

<p>An emerging optimisation problem from the real-world applications, named the
multi-point dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem, has become one of the active
research topics of the multi-robot system. This paper focuses on a
multi-objective MPDA problem which is to design an execution plan of the robots
to minimise the number of robots and the maximal completion time of all the
tasks. The strongly-coupled relationships among robots and tasks, the
redundancy of the MPDA encoding, and the variable-size decision space of the
MO-MPDA problem posed extra challenges for addressing the problem effectively.
To address the above issues, we develop a hybrid decomposition-based
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HDMOEA) using $ \varepsilon
$-constraint method. It selects the maximal completion time of all tasks as the
main objective, and converted the other objective into constraints. HDMOEA
decomposes a MO-MPDA problem into a series of scalar constrained optimization
subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound robot number. All
the subproblems are optimized simultaneously with the transferring knowledge
from other subproblems. Besides, we develop a hybrid population initialisation
mechanism to enhance the quality of initial solutions, and a reproduction
mechanism to transmit effective information and tackle the encoding redundancy.
Experimental results show that the proposed HDMOEA method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of several most-used metrics.

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

<p>Heuristic optimisation algorithms are in high demand due to the overwhelming
amount of complex optimisation problems that need to be solved. The complexity
of these problems is well beyond the boundaries of applicability of exact
optimisation algorithms and therefore require modern heuristics to find
feasible solutions quickly. These heuristics and their effects are almost
always evaluated and explained by particular problem instances. In previous
works, it has been shown that many such algorithms show structural bias, by
either being attracted to a certain region of the search space or by
consistently avoiding regions of the search space, on a special test function
designed to ensure uniform 'exploration' of the domain. In this paper, we
analyse the emergence of such structural bias for Differential Evolution (DE)
configurations and, specifically, the effect of different mutation, crossover
and correction strategies. We also analyse the emergence of the structural bias
during the run-time of each algorithm. We conclude with recommendations of
which configurations should be avoided in order to run DE unbiased.

<p>The identification of abnormal electrographic activity is important in a wide
range of neurological disorders, including epilepsy for localising
epileptogenic tissue. However, this identification may be challenging during
non-seizure (interictal) periods, especially if abnormalities are subtle
compared to the repertoire of possible healthy brain dynamics. Here, we
investigate if such interictal abnormalities become more salient by
quantitatively accounting for the range of healthy brain dynamics in a
location-specific manner. To this end, we constructed a normative map of brain
dynamics, in terms of relative band power, from interictal intracranial
recordings from 234 subjects (21,598 electrode contacts). We then compared
interictal recordings from 62 patients with epilepsy to the normative map to
identify abnormal regions. We hypothesised that if the most abnormal regions
were spared by surgery, then patients would be more likely to experience
continued seizures post-operatively. We first confirmed that the spatial
variations of band power in the normative map across brain regions were
consistent with healthy variations reported in the literature. Second, when
accounting for the normative variations, regions which were spared by surgery
were more abnormal than those resected only in patients with persistent
post-operative seizures (t=-3.6, p=0.0003), confirming our hypothesis. Third,
we found that this effect discriminated patient outcomes (AUC=0.75 p=0.0003).
Normative mapping is a well-established practice in neuroscientific research.
Our study suggests that this approach is feasible to detect interictal
abnormalities in intracranial EEG, and of potential clinical value to identify
pathological tissue in epilepsy. Finally, we make our normative intracranial
map publicly available to facilitate future investigations in epilepsy and
beyond.

<p>Standard few-shot experiments involve learning to efficiently match
previously unseen samples by class. We claim that few-shot learning should be
long term, assimilating knowledge for the future, without forgetting previous
concepts. In the mammalian brain, the hippocampus is understood to play a
significant role in this process, by learning rapidly and consolidating
knowledge to the neocortex incrementally over a short period. In this research
we tested whether an artificial hippocampal algorithm (AHA), could be used with
a conventional Machine Learning (ML) model that learns incrementally analogous
to the neocortex, to achieve one-shot learning both short and long term. The
results demonstrated that with the addition of AHA, the system could learn in
one-shot and consolidate the knowledge for the long term without catastrophic
forgetting. This study is one of the first examples of using a CLS model of
hippocampus to consolidate memories, and it constitutes a step toward few-shot
continual learning.

<p>With the rapid development of computing technology, wearable devices such as
smart phones and wristbands make it easy to get access to people's health
information including activities, sleep, sports, etc. Smart healthcare achieves
great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user
data. However, there are two critical challenges. Firstly, user data often
exists in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform
aggregation without compromising privacy security. Secondly, the models trained
on the cloud fail on personalization. In this paper, we propose FedHealth, the
first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle
these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated
learning, and then builds personalized models by transfer learning. It is able
to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy
and security. Experiments demonstrate that FedHealth produces higher accuracy
(5.3% improvement) for wearable activity recognition when compared to
traditional methods. FedHealth is general and extensible and has the potential
to be used in many healthcare applications.

<p>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). EAE reflects important histopathological hallmarks, dissemination, and diversity of the disease, but has only moderate reproducibility of clinical and histopathological features. Focal lesions are less frequently observed in EAE than in MS, and can neither be constrained to specific locations nor timed to occur at a pre-specified moment. This renders difficult any experimental assessment of the pathogenesis of lesion evolution, including its inflammatory, degenerative (demyelination and axonal degeneration), and reparatory (remyelination, axonal sprouting, gliosis) component processes. We sought to develop a controlled model of inflammatory, focal brain lesions in EAE using focused ultrasound (FUS). We hypothesized that FUS induced focal blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) will increase the likelihood of transmigration of effector cells and subsequent lesion occurrence at the sonicated location. Lesion development was monitored with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and further analyzed by histopathological means. EAE was induced in 12 6–8 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide. FUS-induced BBBD was performed 6, 7, and 9 days after immunization in subgroups of four animals and in an additional control group. MRI and MRE were performed on a 7T horizontal bore small animal MRI scanner. Imaging was conducted longitudinally 2 and 3 weeks after disease induction and 1 week after sonication in control animals, respectively. The scan protocol comprised contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences as well as MRE with a vibration frequency of 1 kHz. Animals were sacrificed for histopathology after the last imaging time point. The overall clinical course of EAE was mild. A total of seven EAE animals presented with focal T2w hyperintense signal alterations in the sonicated hemisphere. These were most frequent in the group of animals sonicated 9 days after immunization. Histopathology revealed foci of activated microglia/macrophages in the sonicated right hemisphere of seven EAE animals. Larger cellular infiltrates or apparent demyelination were not seen. Control animals showed no abnormalities on MRI and did not have clusters of activated microglia/macrophages at the sites targeted with FUS. None of the animals had hemorrhages or gross tissue damage as potential side effects of FUS. EAE-animals tended to have lower values of viscoelasticity and elasticity in the sonicated compared to the contralateral parenchyma. This trend was significant when comparing the right sonicated to the left normal hemisphere and specifically the right sonicated compared to the left normal cortex in animals that underwent FUS-BBBD 9 days after immunization (right vs. left hemisphere: mean viscoelasticity 6.1 vs. 7.2 kPa; p = 0.003 and mean elasticity 4.9 vs. 5.7 kPa, p = 0.024; right vs. left cortex: mean viscoelasticity 5.8 vs. 7.5 kPa; p = 0.004 and mean elasticity 5 vs. 6.5 kPa; p = 0.008). A direct comparison of the biomechanical properties of focal T2w hyperintensities with normal appearing brain tissue did not yield significant results. Control animals showed no differences in viscoelasticity between sonicated and contralateral brain parenchyma. We here provide first evidence for a controlled lesion induction model in EAE using FUS-induced BBBD. The observed lesions in EAE are consistent with foci of activated microglia that may be interpreted as targeted initial inflammatory activity and which have been described as pre-active lesions in MS. Such foci can be identified and monitored with MRI. Moreover, the increased inflammatory activity in the sonicated brain parenchyma seems to have an effect on overall tissue matrix structure as reflected by changes of biomechanical parameters.</p>

<p>This mini-review provides a detailed outline of studies that have used multimodal approaches in non-invasive brain stimulation to investigate the pathophysiology of the three common movement disorders, namely, essential tremor, Parkinson’s disease, and dystonia. Using specific search terms and filters in the PubMed<sup>®</sup> database, we finally shortlisted 27 studies in total that were relevant to this review. While two-thirds (Brittain et al., 2013) of these studies were performed on Parkinson’s disease patients, we could find only three studies that were conducted in patients with essential tremor. We clearly show that although multimodal non-invasive brain stimulation holds immense potential in unraveling the physiological mechanisms that are disrupted in movement disorders, the technical challenges and pitfalls of combining these methods may hinder their widespread application by movement disorder specialists. A multidisciplinary team with clinical and technical expertise may be crucial in reaping the fullest benefits from such novel multimodal approaches.</p>

<p>Social dominance hierarchies are a common adaptation to group living and exist across a broad range of the animal kingdom. Social dominance is known to rely on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region that shows a protracted developmental trajectory in mice. However, it is unknown to what extent the social dominance hierarchy is plastic across postnatal development and how it is regulated. Here we identified a sensitive period for experience-dependent social dominance plasticity in adolescent male mice, which is regulated by mechanisms that affect cortical plasticity. We show that social dominance hierarchies in male mice are already formed at weaning and are highly stable into adulthood. However, one experience of forced losing significantly reduces social dominance during the adolescent period but not in adulthood, suggesting adolescence as a sensitive period for experience-dependent social dominance plasticity. Notably, robust adolescent plasticity can be prolonged into adulthood by genetic deletion of Lynx1, a molecular brake that normally limits cortical plasticity through modulation of cortical nicotinic signaling. This plasticity is associated with increased activation of established nodes of the social dominance network including dorsal medial PFC and medial dorsal thalamus evidenced by increased c-Fos. Pharmacologically mediated elevation of cortical plasticity by valproic acid rapidly destabilizes the hierarchy of adult wildtype animals. These findings provide insight into mechanisms through which increased behavioral plasticity may be achieved to improve therapeutic recovery from psychiatric disorders that are associated with social deficits.</p>

<p>Classical Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are members of the Ras small GTPase superfamily and play essential roles in a variety of cellular functions. Rho GTPase signaling can be turned on and off by specific GEFs and GAPs, respectively. These features empower Rho GTPases and their upstream and downstream modulators as targets for scientific research and therapeutic intervention. Specifically, significant therapeutic potential exists for targeting Rho GTPases in neurodegenerative diseases due to their widespread cellular activity and alterations in neural tissues. This study will explore the roles of Rho GTPases in neurodegenerative diseases with focus on the applications of pharmacological modulators in recent discoveries. There have been exciting developments of small molecules, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and natural products and toxins for each classical Rho GTPase category. A brief overview of each category followed by examples in their applications will be provided. The literature on their roles in various diseases [e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Multiple sclerosis (MS)] highlights the unique and broad implications targeting Rho GTPases for potential therapeutic intervention. Clearly, there is increasing knowledge of therapeutic promise from the discovery of pharmacological modulators of Rho GTPases for managing and treating these conditions. The progress is also accompanied by the recognition of complex Rho GTPase modulation where targeting its signaling can improve some aspects of pathogenesis while exacerbating others in the same disease model. Future directions should emphasize the importance of elucidating how different Rho GTPases work in concert and how they produce such widespread yet different cellular responses during neurodegenerative disease progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.655568">Therapeutic Development for CGG Repeat Expansion-Associated Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

<p>Non-coding repeat expansions, such as CGG, GGC, CUG, CCUG, and GGGGCC, have been shown to be involved in many human diseases, particularly neurological disorders. Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5’UTR region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal GGC repeat expansion within the 5’UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD)—including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS)—is related to gait impairment. However, the association between the total magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cSVD burden and gait and upper extremity function remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to assess the correlation between the total MRI cSVD burden score and gait impairment as well as upper extremity impairment.</p><p>Method: A total of 224 participants underwent MRI scans, and the presence of lacunes, WMHs, CMBs, and EPVS was evaluated and recorded as a total MRI cSVD burden score (range 0–4). Gait was assessed by 4-m walkway, Tinetti, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests. Upper extremity function was assessed by 10-repeat hand pronation-supination time, 10-repeat finger-tapping time, and 10-repeat hand opening and closing time.</p><p>Result: The mean age of the 224 participants was 60.6 ± 10.5 years, and 64.3% were men. Independent of age, sex, height, and vascular risk factors, multivariable linear regression analyses showed that a higher total MRI cSVD burden score was related to a shorter stride length, wider step width, higher cadence, and poorer performance on the Tinetti, TUG, and SPPB tests and upper extremity tests (all P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Total MRI cSVD burden was associated with gait impairment and upper extremity disturbances, suggesting that total MRI cSVD burden might contribute to motor function decline. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether there is a causal relationship between total MRI cSVD burden and motor function decline.</p>

<p>Patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) exhibit a high risk of cognitive impairment that might be caused by neurologic deficits and vascular injuries. However, the mechanism remains unknown. In current study, 24 normal controls (NC) and 54 SIVD patients, including 26 SIVD patients with no cognitive impairment (SIVD-NCI) and 28 SIVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (SIVD-MCI) underwent the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological assessments. We combined regional homogeneity (ReHo) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) by using the global ReHo-CBF correlations coefficient and the ReHo/CBF ratio to detect the inner link between neuronal activity and vascular responses. Correlations between the ReHo/CBF ratio and neuropsychological assessments were explored in patients with SIVD. As a result, we identified significantly decreased global ReHo-CBF coupling in the SIVD-NCI group and SIVD- MCI group with respect to the NC. The SIVD-MCI group showed more serious decoupling of the global ReHo-CBF correlation. We also found a significantly abnormal ReHo/CBF ratio predominantly located in cognitive-related brain regions, including the left insula, right middle temporal gyrus, right precuneus, left precentral gyrus, and left inferior parietal lobule but not the supramarginal and angular gyri. The SIVD-MCI group showed more severe disorders of neurovascular coupling than the other two groups. Moreover, the ReHo/CBF ratio in the left precentral gyrus of the SIVD-NCI group exhibited a positive correlation with the MMSE scores. These findings suggested that patients with SIVD show abnormal neurovascular coupling at the early stage of the disease and during disease development. It might be associated with disease severity and cognitive impairment. Neurovascular decoupling in brain may be a possible neuropathological mechanism of SIVD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66226">Structural basis for allosteric control of the SERCA-Phospholamban membrane complex by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation</a></h4>

Phospholamban (PLN) is a mini-membrane protein that directly controls the cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport response to b-adrenergic stimulation, thus modulating cardiac output during the fight-or-flight response. In the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, PLN binds to the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA), keeping this enzyme's function within a narrow physiological window. PLN phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A or increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration reverses the inhibitory effects through an unknown mechanism. Using oriented-sample solid-state NMR spectroscopy and replica-averaged NMR-restrained structural refinement, we reveal that phosphorylation of PLN;s cytoplasmic regulatory domain signals the disruption of several inhibitory contacts at the transmembrane binding interface of the SERCA-PLN complex that are propagated to the enzyme;s active site, augmenting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. Our findings address long-standing questions about SERCA regulation, epitomizing a signal transduction mechanism operated by posttranslationally modified bitopic membrane proteins.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65897">Homoplasy in the evolution of modern human-like joint proportions in <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i></a></h4>

The evolution of bipedalism and reduced reliance on arboreality in hominins resulted in larger lower limb joints relative to the joints of the upper limb. The pattern and timing of this transition, however, remains unresolved. Here, we find the limb joint proportions of <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>, <i>Homo erectus</i>, and <i>Homo naledi</i> to resemble those of modern humans, whereas those of <i>A. africanus</i>, <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>, <i>Paranthropus robustus</i>, <i>Paranthropus boisei</i>, <i>Homo habilis</i>, and <i>Homo floresiensis</i> are more ape-like. The homology of limb joint proportions in <i>A. afarensis</i> and modern humans can only be explained by a series of evolutionary reversals irrespective of differing phylogenetic hypotheses. Thus, the independent evolution of modern human-like limb joint proportions in <i>A. afarensis</i> is a more parsimonious explanation. Overall, these results support an emerging perspective in hominin paleobiology that <i>A. afarensis</i> was the most terrestrially adapted australopith despite the importance of arboreality throughout much of early hominin evolution.

The model organism <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mounts transcriptional defense responses against intestinal bacterial infections that elicit overlapping starvation and infection responses, the regulation of which is not well understood. Direct comparison of <i>C. elegans</i> that were starved or infected with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> revealed a large infection-specific transcriptional signature, which was almost completely abrogated by deletion of transcription factor <i>hlh-30/TFEB</i>, except for six genes including a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) gene, <i>fmo-2/FMO5</i>. Deletion of <i>fmo-2/FMO5</i> severely compromised infection survival, thus identifying the first FMO with innate immunity functions in animals. Moreover, <i>fmo-2/FMO5</i> induction required the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49/PPAR-α, which controlled host defense cell non-autonomously. These findings reveal an infection-specific host response to <i>S. aureus</i>, identify HLH-30/TFEB as its main regulator, reveal FMOs as important innate immunity effectors in animals, and identify the mechanism of FMO regulation through NHR-49/PPAR-α during <i>S. aureus </i>infection, with implications for host defense and inflammation in higher organisms.

NMDA receptors promote repolarization in pancreatic beta cells and thereby reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, NMDA receptors are a potential therapeutic target for diabetes. While the mechanism of NMDA receptor inhibition in beta cells is rather well understood at the molecular level, its possible effects on the collective cellular activity have not been addressed to date, even though proper insulin secretion patterns result from well-synchronized beta cell behavior. The latter is enabled by strong intercellular connectivity, which governs propagating calcium waves across the islets and makes the heterogeneous beta cell population work in synchrony. Since a disrupted collective activity is an important and possibly early contributor to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance, it is of utmost importance to understand possible effects of NMDA receptor inhibition on beta cell functional connectivity. To address this issue, we combined confocal functional multicellular calcium imaging in mouse tissue slices with network science approaches. Our results revealed that NMDA receptor inhibition increases, synchronizes, and stabilizes beta cell activity without affecting the velocity or size of calcium waves. To explore intercellular interactions more precisely, we made use of the multilayer network formalism by regarding each calcium wave as an individual network layer, with weighted directed connections portraying the intercellular propagation. NMDA receptor inhibition stabilized both the role of wave initiators and the course of waves. The findings obtained with the experimental antagonist of NMDA receptors, MK-801, were additionally validated with dextrorphan, the active metabolite of the approved drug dextromethorphan, as well as with experiments on NMDA receptor KO mice. In sum, our results provide additional and new evidence for a possible role of NMDA receptor inhibition in treatment of type 2 diabetes and introduce the multilayer network paradigm as a general strategy to examine effects of drugs on connectivity in multicellular systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JLqY-naQ8ug" width="1" />

Exaggerated sexually selected traits, often carried by males, are characterized by the evolution of hyperallometry, resulting in their disproportionate growth relative to the rest of the body among individuals of the same population. While the evolution of allometry has attracted much attention for centuries, our understanding of the developmental genetic mechanisms underlying its emergence remains fragmented. Here we conduct comparative transcriptomics of the legs followed by an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that play a role in the hyperallometric growth of the third legs in the males of the water strider <i>Microvelia longipes</i>. We demonstrate that a broadly expressed growth factor, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 11 (BMP11, also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 11), regulates leg allometries through increasing the allometric slope and mean body size in males. In contrast, <i>BMP11</i> RNAi reduced mean body size but did not affect slope either in the females of <i>M</i>. <i>longipes</i> or in the males and females of other closely related <i>Microvelia</i> species. Furthermore, our data show that a tissue-specific factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), increases intercept without affecting mean body size. This indicates a genetic correlation between mean body size and variation in allometric slope, but not intercept. Strikingly, males treated with <i>BMP11</i> RNAi exhibited a severe reduction in fighting frequency compared to both controls and <i>Ubx</i> RNAi-treated males. Therefore, male body size, the exaggerated weapon, and the intense fighting behavior associated with it are genetically correlated in <i>M</i>. <i>longipes</i>. Our results support a possible role of pleiotropy in the evolution of allometric slope.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RsDDLm4AxGA" width="1" />

We highlighted the spatial distribution of the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus desert ants. We further show behavioral‐stage‐related changes in allatostatin‐A and corazonin expression patterns. The results suggest that these neuropeptides are highly promising candidate modulators for major behavioral transitions of the ants.







Abstract
Age‐related behavioral plasticity is a major prerequisite for the ecological success of insect societies. Although ecological aspects of behavioral flexibility have been targeted in many studies, the underlying intrinsic mechanisms controlling the diverse changes in behavior along the individual life history of social insects are not completely understood. Recently, the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin have been associated with the regulation of behavioral transitions in social insects. Here, we investigated changes in brain localization and expression of these neuropeptides following major behavioral transitions in Cataglyphis nodus ants. Our immunohistochemical analyses in the brain revealed that the overall branching pattern of neurons immunoreactive (ir) for the three neuropeptides is largely independent of the behavioral stages. Numerous allatostatin‐A‐ and tachykinin‐ir neurons innervate primary sensory neuropils and high‐order integration centers of the brain. In contrast, the number of corazonergic neurons is restricted to only four neurons per brain hemisphere with cell bodies located in the pars lateralis and axons extending to the medial protocerebrum and the retrocerebral complex. Most interestingly, the cell‐body volumes of these neurons are significantly increased in foragers compared to freshly eclosed ants and interior workers. Quantification of mRNA expression levels revealed a stage‐related change in the expression of allatostatin‐A and corazonin mRNA in the brain. Given the presence of the neuropeptides in major control centers of the brain and the neurohemal organs, these mRNA‐changes strongly suggest an important modulatory role of both neuropeptides in the behavioral maturation of Cataglyphis ants.

<p>Unlike robots, humans learn, adapt and perceive their bodies by interacting
with the world. Discovering how the brain represents the body and generates
actions is of major importance for robotics and artificial intelligence. Here
we discuss how neuroscience findings open up opportunities to improve current
estimation and control algorithms in robotics. In particular, how active
inference, a mathematical formulation of how the brain resists a natural
tendency to disorder, provides a unified recipe to potentially solve some of
the major challenges in robotics, such as adaptation, robustness, flexibility,
generalization and safe interaction. This paper summarizes some experiments and
lessons learned from developing such a computational model on real embodied
platforms, i.e., humanoid and industrial robots. Finally, we showcase the
limitations and challenges that we are still facing to give robots human-like
perception

<p>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Amyloid β (Aβ) impairs synaptic function by inhibiting long-term potentiation (LTP), and by facilitating long-term depression (LTD). There is now evidence from AD models that Aβ provokes this shift toward synaptic depression by triggering the access to and accumulation of PTEN in the postsynaptic terminal of hippocampal neurons. Here we quantified the PTEN in 196,138 individual excitatory dentate gyrus synapses from AD patients at different stages of the disease and from controls with no neuropathological findings. We detected a gradual increase of synaptic PTEN in AD brains as the disease progresses, in conjunction with a significant decrease in synaptic density. The synapses that remain in symptomatic AD patients are more likely to be smaller and exhibit fewer AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Hence, a high Aβ load appears to strongly compromise human hippocampal synapses, as reflected by an increase in PTEN, inducing a loss of AMPARs that may eventually provoke synaptic failure and loss.</p>

<p>Semaphorins, originally discovered as guidance cues for developing axons, are involved in many processes that shape the nervous system during development, from neuronal proliferation and migration to neuritogenesis and synapse formation. Interestingly, the expression of many Semaphorins persists after development. For instance, Semaphorin 3A is a component of perineuronal nets, the extracellular matrix structures enwrapping certain types of neurons in the adult CNS, which contribute to the closure of the critical period for plasticity. Semaphorin 3G and 4C play a crucial role in the control of adult hippocampal connectivity and memory processes, and Semaphorin 5A and 7A regulate adult neurogenesis. This evidence points to a role of Semaphorins in the regulation of adult neuronal plasticity. In this review, we address the distribution of Semaphorins in the adult nervous system and we discuss their function in physiological and pathological processes.</p>

<p>In animals, circadian clocks impose a daily rhythmicity to many behaviors and physiological processes. At the molecular level, circadian rhythms are driven by intracellular transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFL). Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates that they can also be modulated by multiple signaling pathways. Among these, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling plays a key role in regulating the molecular rhythms of clock genes and of the resulting circadian behavior. In addition, the application of in vivo imaging approaches has revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is fundamental to the synchronization of the neuronal networks that make up circadian pacemakers. Conversely, the activity of circadian clocks may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. For instance, several genes that encode Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression, and a disruption of this cycling affects circadian function, underscoring their reciprocal relationship. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling both modulates and is modulated by circadian clocks, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms described in Drosophila and mice. In particular, we examine findings related to the oscillations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in circadian pacemakers and how they are regulated by canonical clock genes, neuropeptides, and light stimuli. In addition, we discuss how Ca<sup>2+</sup> rhythms and their associated signaling pathways modulate clock gene expression at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. We also review evidence based on transcriptomic analyzes that suggests that mammalian Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and transporters (e.g., ryanodine receptor, ip3r, serca, L- and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (e.g., camk, cask, and calcineurin) show rhythmic expression in the central brain clock and in peripheral tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscles. Finally, we discuss how the discovery that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is regulated by the circadian clock could influence the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and the outcomes of clinical interventions.</p>

<p>Microglia play an important role in neurodegenerative disease [i.e., Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. These diseases share some similar pathological changes and several microglia-associated processes, including immune response, neuroinflammation, phagocytosis, elimination of synapses et al. Microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) has been described as having both destructive and protective effects in neurological disorders. Besides, considerable evidence also indicates that microglia play a significant role in neurogenesis, neuronal cell death, and synaptic interactions. The communication between microglia and neurons is of vital role in regulating complex functions which are key to appropriate the activity of the brain. Accumulating studies have also demonstrated that exosomes with sizes ranging from 40–100 nm, released by microglia, could serve as key mediators in intercellular signaling. These exosomes, identified in terms of cellular origin in many kinds of biological fluids, exert their effects by delivering specific cargos such as proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs. It was shown that microglial exosomes could transport to and be uptake by neurons, which may either be beneficial or instead, detrimental to CNS diseases. The focus of this review is to summarize the involvement of microglial exosomes in critical pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease and how they contribute to these disorders, including PD, AD, and ALS. We also review the application of microglia exosomes as potential biomarkers in monitoring disease progression, as well as focusing on their roles as drug delivery vehicles in treating neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Background: Identifying patients with intractable epilepsy who would benefit from therapeutic chronic vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) preoperatively remains a major clinical challenge. We have developed a statistical model for predicting VNS efficacy using only routine preimplantation electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded with the TruScan EEG device (Brazdil et al., 2019). It remains to be seen, however, if this model can be applied in different clinical settings.</p><p>Objective: To validate our model using EEG data acquired with a different recording system.</p><p>Methods: We identified a validation cohort of eight patients implanted with VNS, whose preimplantation EEG was recorded on the BrainScope device and who underwent the EEG recording according to the protocol. The classifier developed in our earlier work, named Pre-X-Stim, was then employed to classify these patients as predicted responders or non-responders based on the dynamics in EEG power spectra. Predicted and real-world outcomes were compared to establish the applicability of this classifier.

<p>After acquiring knowledge of the neuroscience of learning, memory, stress and emotions, teachers incorporate more cognitive engagement and student-centered practices into their lessons. However, the role understanding neuroscience plays in teachers own affective and motivational competencies has not yet been investigated. The goal of this study was to investigate how learning neuroscience effected teachers’ self-efficacy, beliefs in their ability to teach effectively, self-responsibility and other components of teacher motivation. A pilot training-of-trainers program was designed and delivered in Liberia combining basic neuroscience with information on social, emotional, behavioral and mental health issues faced by students. Tier I of the professional development was a 2 weeks workshop led by a visiting neuroscientist. A subset of the 24 Tier I secondary science teachers formed a Leadership Team who adapted the content to the Liberian context and subsequently led additional workshops and follow-up sessions for the Tier II secondary science teachers. Science teachers in both tiers completed the affective-motivational scales from the internationally vetted, multiscale Innovative Teaching for Effective Learning Teacher Knowledge Survey from the OECD. Tier II teachers completed the survey in a pre-post-delayed post design. Tier I teachers completed the survey after the workshop with their attitudes at that time and separately with retrospective projections of their pre-workshop attitudes. Ten of the 92 Tier II teachers participated in structured interviews at follow-up. Statistical analysis of survey data demonstrated improved teacher self-efficacy, self-responsibility for student outcomes, and motivation to teach. Qualitatively, teachers expressed more confidence in their ability to motivate students, engage them through active learning, and manage the class through positive rather than negative reinforcement. Teachers’ own self-regulation improved as they made efforts to build supporting relationships with students. Together, these results demonstrated that (i) teacher affective-motivational attitudes can be altered with professional development, (ii) basic neuroscience, as knowledge of how students learn, can improve teacher competency, and (iii) a training-of-trainers model can be effective in a low and middle income country for disseminating neuroscience knowledge, increasing teachers’ knowledge of students’ social and emotional needs, and promoting educational improvement.</p>

<p>How deeply does action influence perception? Does action performance affect the perception of object features directly related to action only? Or does it concern also object features such as colors, which are not held to directly afford action? The present study aimed at answering these questions. We asked participants to repeatedly grasp a handled mug hidden from their view before judging whether a visually presented mug was blue rather than cyan. The motor training impacted on their perceptual judgments, by speeding participants’ responses, when the handle of the presented mug was spatially aligned with the trained hand. The priming effect did not occur when participants were trained to merely touch the mug with their hand closed in a fist. This indicates that action performance may shape the perceptual judgment on object features, even when these features are colors and do not afford any action. How we act on surrounding objects is therefore not without consequence for how we experience them.</p>

<p>Abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance is a distinctive pathological mechanism for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the lipidation of apolipoprotein E, plays a critical role in Aβ clearance. As an environmental factor for AD, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) can decrease ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and disrupt Aβ clearance. Liver X receptor α (LXRα) is an autoregulatory transcription factor for ABCA1 and a target of some environmental pollutants, such as organophosphate pesticides. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether DDT could affect Aβ clearance by targeting LXRα. The DDT-pretreated H4 human neuroglioma cells and immortalized astrocytes were incubated with exogenous Aβ to evaluate Aβ consumption. Meanwhile, cytotoxicity and LXRα expression were determined in the DDT-treated cells. Subsequently, the antagonism of DDT on LXRα agonist T0901317 was determined in vitro. The interaction between DDT and LXRα was predicted by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation technology. We observed that DDT could inhibit Aβ clearance and decrease the levels of LXRα mRNA and LXRα protein. Moreover, DDT is supposed to strongly bind to LXRα and exert antagonistic effects on LXRα. In conclusion, this study firstly presented that DDT could inhibit LXRα expression, which would contribute to Aβ clearance decline in vitro. It provides an experimental basis to search for potential therapeutic targets of AD.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate the value of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)-based histogram analysis in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and to investigate the regions of the most important discriminative features and their contribution to classification discrimination. Patients with PD (n = 59) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 41) were identified and divided into a primary set (80 cases, including 48 patients with PD and 32 HCs) and a validation set (20 cases, including 11 patients with PD and nine HCs). The Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) 116 atlas was used to extract the histogram features of the regions of interest in the brain. Machine learning methods were used in the primary set for data dimensionality reduction, feature selection, model construction, and model performance evaluation. The model performance was further validated in the validation set. After feature data dimension reduction and feature selection, 23 of a total of 1,276 features were entered in the model. The brain regions of the selected features included the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and limbic lobes, as well as the cerebellum and the thalamus. In the primary set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 0.974, the sensitivity was 93.8%, the specificity was 90.6%, and the accuracy was 93.8%. In the validation set, the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.980, 90.9%, 88.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. ALFF-based histogram analysis can be used to classify patients with PD and HCs and to effectively identify abnormal brain function regions in PD patients.</p>

Increasing extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) strongly decreases intrinsic excitability in neurons but the mechanism is unclear. By one hypothesis, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> screens surface charge, reducing voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation and by another [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> activates Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) closing the sodium-leak channel (NALCN). Here we report that neocortical neurons from CaSR-deficient (<i>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice had more negative resting potentials and did not fire spontaneously in reduced divalent-containing solution (T<sub>0.2</sub>) compared to wild-type (WT). However, after setting membrane potential to -70 mV, T<sub>0.2 </sub>application similarly depolarized and increased action potential firing in <i>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT neurons. Enhanced activation of VGSCs was the dominant contributor to the depolarization and increase in excitability by T<sub>0.2 </sub>and occurred due to hyperpolarizing shifts in VGSC window currents. CaSR deletion depolarized VGSC window currents but did not affect NALCN activation. Regulation of VGSC gating by external divalents is the key mechanism mediating divalent-dependent changes in neocortical neuron excitability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67510">A developmental framework linking neurogenesis and circuit formation in the Drosophila CNS</a></h4>

The mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity are well-characterized, yet it remains unclear how or if these mechanisms regulate neural circuit assembly. To address this, we mapped the developmental origin of 160 interneurons from seven bilateral neural progenitors (neuroblasts), and identify them in a synapse-scale TEM reconstruction of the <i>Drosophila</i> larval CNS. We find that lineages concurrently build the sensory and motor neuropils by generating sensory and motor hemilineages in a Notch-dependent manner. Neurons in a hemilineage share common synaptic targeting within the neuropil, which is further refined based on neuronal temporal identity. Connectome analysis shows that hemilineage-temporal cohorts share common connectivity. Finally, we show that proximity alone cannot explain the observed connectivity structure, suggesting hemilineage/temporal identity confers an added layer of specificity. Thus, we demonstrate that the mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity also govern circuit formation and function, and that these principles are broadly applicable throughout the nervous system.

Myocardial infarction (MI) promotes a range of systemic effects, many of which are unknown. Here, we investigated the alterations associated with MI progression in heart and other metabolically active tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose) in a mouse model of MI (induced by ligating the left ascending coronary artery) and sham-operated mice. We performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis on tissue samples obtained 6- and 24-hours post MI or sham operation. By generating tissue-specific biological networks, we observed: (1) dysregulation in multiple biological processes (including immune system, mitochondrial dysfunction, fatty-acid beta-oxidation, and RNA and protein processing) across multiple tissues post MI; and (2) tissue-specific dysregulation in biological processes in liver and heart post MI. Finally, we validated our findings in two independent MI cohorts. Overall, our integrative analysis highlighted both common and specific biological responses to MI across a range of metabolically active tissues.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65192">The role of sigma 1 receptor in organization of endoplasmic reticulum signaling microdomains</a></h4>

Sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is a 223-amino-acid-long transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein. S1R modulates activity of multiple effector proteins and is a well-established drug target. However, signaling functions of S1R in cells are poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that biological activity of S1R in cells can be explained by its ability to interact with cholesterol and to form cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER membrane. By performing experiments in reduced reconstitution systems, we demonstrate direct effects of cholesterol on S1R clustering. We identify a novel cholesterol-binding motif in the transmembrane region of human S1R. Mutations of this motif impair association of recombinant S1R with cholesterol beads, affect S1R clustering in vitro and disrupt S1R subcellular localization. We demonstrate that S1R-induced membrane microdomains have increased local membrane thickness and that increased local cholesterol concentration and/or membrane thickness in these microdomains can modulate signaling of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α in the ER. Further, S1R agonists cause disruption of S1R clusters, suggesting that biological activity of S1R agonists is linked to remodeling of ER membrane microdomains. Our results provide novel insights into S1R-mediated signaling mechanisms in cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64891">In vitro reconstitution reveals major differences between human and bacterial cytochrome c synthases</a></h4>

Cytochromes c are ubiquitous heme proteins in mitochondria and bacteria, all possessing a CXXCH (CysXxxXxxCysHis) motif with covalently attached heme. We describe the first in vitro reconstitution of cytochrome c biogenesis using purified mitochondrial (HCCS) and bacterial (CcsBA) cytochrome c synthases. We employ apocytochrome c and peptide analogs containing CXXCH as substrates, examining recognition determinants, thioether attachment, and subsequent release and folding of cytochrome c. Peptide analogs reveal very different recognition requirements between HCCS and CcsBA. For HCCS, a minimal 16-mer peptide is required, comprised of CXXCH and adjacent alpha helix 1, yet neither thiol is critical for recognition. For bacterial CcsBA, both thiols and histidine are required, but not alpha helix 1. Heme attached peptide analogs are not released from the HCCS active site; thus, folding is important in the release mechanism. Peptide analogs behave as inhibitors of cytochrome c biogenesis, paving the way for targeted control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64020">Coronary plaque composition influences biomechanical stress and predicts plaque rupture in a morpho-mechanic OCT analysis</a></h4>

Plaque rupture occurs if stress within coronary lesions exceeds the protection exerted by the fibrous cap overlying the necrotic lipid core. However, very little is known about the biomechanical stress exerting this disrupting force. Employing optical coherence tomography (OCT), we generated plaque models and performed finite-element analysis to simulate stress distributions within the vessel wall in 10 ruptured and 10 non-ruptured lesions. In ruptured lesions, maximal stress within fibrous cap (peak cap stress [PCS]: 174 ± 67 vs. 52 ± 42 kPa, p&lt;0.001) and vessel wall (maximal plaque stress [MPS]: 399 ± 233 vs. 90 ± 95 kPa, p=0.001) were significantly higher compared to non-ruptured plaques. Ruptures arose in the immediate proximity of maximal stress concentrations (angular distances: 21.8 ± 30.3° for PCS vs. 20.7 ± 23.7° for MPS); stress concentrations excellently predicted plaque rupture (area under the curve: 0.940 for PCS, 0.950 for MPS). This prediction of plaque rupture was superior to established vulnerability features such as fibrous cap thickness or macrophage infiltration. In conclusion, OCT-based finite-element analysis effectively assesses plaque biomechanics, which in turn predicts plaque rupture in patients. This highlights the importance of morpho-mechanic analysis assessing the disrupting effects of plaque stress.

Distinct populations of Purkinje cells (PCs) with unique molecular and connectivity features are at the core of the modular organization of the cerebellum. Previously, we showed that firing activity of Purkinje cells differs between ZebrinII-positive (Z+) and -negative (Z−) cerebellar modules (Zhou et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019). Here, we investigate the timing and extent of PC differentiation during development in mice. We found that several features of PCs, including activity levels, dendritic arborisation, axonal shape and climbing fiber input, develop differentially between nodular and anterior PC populations. Although all PCs show a particularly rapid development in the second postnatal week, anterior PCs typically have a prolonged physiological and dendritic maturation. In line herewith, younger mice exhibit attenuated anterior-dependent eyeblink conditioning, but faster nodular-dependent compensatory eye movement adaptation. Our results indicate that specific cerebellar regions have unique developmental timelines which match with their related, specific forms of cerebellum-dependent behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60988">Adapting non-invasive human recordings along multiple task-axes shows unfolding of spontaneous and over-trained choice</a></h4>

Choices rely on a transformation of sensory inputs into motor responses. Using invasive single neuron recordings, the evolution of a choice process has been tracked by projecting population neural responses into state spaces. Here we develop an approach that allows us to recover similar trajectories on a millisecond timescale in non-invasive human recordings. We selectively suppress activity related to three task-axes, relevant and irrelevant sensory inputs and response direction in magnetoencephalography data acquired during context-dependent choices. Recordings from premotor cortex show a progression from processing sensory input to processing the response. In contrast to previous macaque recordings, information related to choice-irrelevant features is represented more weakly than choice-relevant sensory information. To test whether this mechanistic difference between species is caused by extensive overtraining common in non-human primate studies, we trained humans on &gt;20,000 trials of the task. Choice-irrelevant features were still weaker than relevant features in premotor cortex after overtraining.

The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e., DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin) and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary, we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain and contribute to this growth.

A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.







Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation. We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b, and 1–2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.

Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) and the purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2X3R) label relatively distinct populations of nociceptors in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These two unique populations, known as the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic nociceptors, innervate different lamina of the rodent spinal dorsal horn. However, contrary to previous reports in rodent, we find that CGRP and P2X3R are highly co‐expressed in the human DRG and terminate in the same laminae (laminae 1–2) of the spinal dorsal horn. Additionally, we find that other markers such as TrpV1 and Nav1.7 are more widely expressed in human and innervate laminae 1–2 of the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that sensory neurons and their central projections are different between mice and humans.







Abstract
Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long‐standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non‐peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co‐expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1, and Nav1.7 proteins stained the entirety of lamina 1–2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.

In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.







Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.

Morphology of Satb2 expressing ganglion cells in macaque, human, and marmoset retinas. The study shows that Satb2 expression in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World and New World primate species.







Abstract
In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue‐yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide‐field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide‐field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT‐rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5–4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction‐selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings imply that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.

Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal's directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed (1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, (2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, (3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and (4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain's spatial processing circuitry.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25118?af=R">Astrocytes in rare neurological conditions: Morphological and functional considerations</a></h4>

Astrocytes are essential cells of the CNS with several functions relating to neuronal and overall homeostasis. As a result, astrocytic dysfunction can cause widespread detrimental effects. There still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is only beginning to be explored. Accordingly, we will detail the role of astrocytes in over 40+ rare neurological conditions through the lens of function and morphology and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.







Abstract
Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood–brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.

Wei et al. characterized morpho‐physiological properties and connectivity of VIP+ interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus. VIP+ interneurons comprise four morphologically distinct subtypes with variable physiological properties and preferentially innervate GABAergic interneurons over glutamatergic principal cells.







Abstract
The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex. Local‐circuit inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) regulate the excitation–inhibition balance in the DG principal neurons (PNs) and therefore are critical for information processing. Similar to PNs, GABAergic INs also receive distinct inhibitory inputs. Among various classes of INs, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide‐expressing (VIP+) INs preferentially target other INs in several brain regions and thereby directly modulate the GABAergic system. However, the morpho‐physiological characteristics and postsynaptic targets of VIP+ INs in the DG are poorly understood. Here, we report that VIP+ INs in the mouse DG are highly heterogeneous based on their morpho‐physiological characteristics. In approximately two‐thirds of morphologically reconstructed cells, their axons ramify in the hilus. The remaining cells project their axons exclusively to the molecular layer (15%), to both the molecular layer and hilus (10%), or throughout the entire DG layers (8%). Generally, VIP+ INs display variable intrinsic properties and discharge patterns without clear correlation with their morphologies. Finally, VIP+ INs are recruited with a long latency in response to theta‐band cortical inputs and preferentially innervate GABAergic INs over glutamatergic PNs. In summary, VIP+ INs in the DG are composed of highly diverse subpopulations and control the DG output via disinhibition.

Abstract
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus, which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (∼2.5 months old ) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: (1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; (2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and (3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: (1) PDYN expression in granule cells; (2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; (3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and (4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.

The diabetic retinopathy in the diurnal rodent Psammomys obesus is manifested by a functional and structural dysfunction. The functional alteration detected by the decrease in the amplitude of the ERG components over time following the diabetic induction. Whereas the structural dysfunction is evinced by the disruption of retinal architecture and the appearance of exudates at an advanced stage of the disease progression as well as the decrease of the retinal thinness.







Abstract
To investigate the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a new diurnal animal model, we monitored clinically the DR in Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) during 7 months using electroretinography (ERG) and imaging techniques. After the onset of DR, all ERG components decreased progressively. In scotopic conditions, by 3‐months of disease progression, the diabetic P. obesus displayed a significant decrease in amplitude of b‐max, b‐wave responses, and mixed b‐waves. While mixed a‐wave decreased between 4 and 7 months. Significant differences of OP2 appeared following 1 month of disease. In photopic conditions, we noticed a decrease in the a‐wave at 2 months, while it took more than 5 months in b‐wave amplitude. The photopic negative response (PhNR) and the i‐wave amplitudes decreased following 4 and 5 months. OP1 and OP2 were the first to be altered and a significant decrease in the amplitude started after 3 months. Finally, 30 Hz‐flicker and photopic S‐cone were impaired after 2 and 3 months, respectively. The assessment of the eye fundus of the retina revealed an abnormal vascular architecture appeared at Months 6 and 7. In addition, we noticed exudates in the superior periphery of the retina at the same stage. The retina thickness showed a significant reduction at Month 7. Our results indicate that the clinical correlates of human DR are present in diabetic P. obesus. The depressed of ERGs, disruption of retinal architecture, and the appearance of exudates may reflect vascular and neuronal damage throughout the retina as are seen in the advanced stages of human DR.

Expression patterns of all CRH/UCN family genes have not been thoroughly described in any fish species. In a highly social cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, we used in situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of crhb, uts1, ucn2, and ucn3. Phylogenetic analyses revealed evolutionary relationships and novel urocortin orthologs.







Abstract
The corticotropin‐releasing hormone and urocortin family of peptides consists of five members in many vertebrates: CRH (crha/crhb in teleosts), CRH2, UCN/UTS1, UCN2, and UCN3. These genes differ in expression pattern, as well as receptor affinity, allowing them to serve a wide range of functions in a variety of species. To better understand the roles of these genes in a single species, we examined their expression patterns in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. In situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of crhb, uts1, ucn2, and ucn3 in the brain revealed conserved and distinct spatial features of expression. crhb‐ and uts1‐expressing cells were the most broadly distributed, with several areas of co‐regionalization. ucn3 was less abundant but was found in discrete regions throughout the extent of the brain, with high expression in the cerebellum, while ucn2 was restricted to only a few areas. RT‐PCR showed that while crhb, uts1, and ucn3 are found in several body tissues and widespread throughout the brain, ucn2 is quite restricted in the brain, and crha is only expressed in the eye. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses identified detailed relationships and novel orthologs in the urocortin family. We found evidence for a UCN2 gene loss in some reptiles. Our detailed description of the complete family of genes in the central nervous system of a model organism will inform future studies on the function of these genes in A. burtoni and provides a foundation for comparative studies with teleosts and other vertebrates.

The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best explored neuroethological model systems. The study presents a histological investigation of the nuclei of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), a songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience.







Abstract
The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best studied neuroethological model systems. So far, it has been treated as a relatively constrained sensorimotor system. Songbirds such as crows, however, are also known for their capability to cognitively control their audio‐vocal system. Yet, the neuroanatomy of the corvid song system has never been explored systematically. We aim to close this scientific gap by presenting a stereotactic investigation of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), an oscine songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience. In order to identify and delineate the song nuclei, the ascending auditory nuclei, and the descending vocal‐motor nuclei, four stains were applied. In addition to the classical Nissl‐, myelin‐, and a combination of Nissl‐and‐myelin staining, staining for tyrosine hydroxylase was used to reveal the distribution of catecholaminergic neurons (dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic) in the song system. We show that the crow brain contains the important song‐related nuclei, including auditory input and motor output structures, and map them throughout the brain. Fiber‐stained sections reveal putative connection patterns between the crow's song nuclei comparable to other songbirds.

The synaptic circuitry of primary sensory thalamic nuclei has been well characterized and shows striking similarities both in terminal morphology and chemical characteristics. The exception to this is the taste thalamus, the VPMP. A past study of synaptic circuitry in the rat taste thalamus (VPMpc) revealed marked differences from other nuclei like the LGN and MGN. Our data demonstrate that the tree shrew VPMP shares synaptic characteristics common to primary sensory thalamic nuclei including presynaptic interneuron dendrites, large VGluT2 positive terminals, and triadic arrangements in glomeruli.







Abstract
Ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis (VPMP) nucleus of the primate thalamus receives direct input from the nucleus of the solitary tract, whereas the homologous thalamic structure in the rodent does not. To reveal whether the synaptic circuitries in these nuclei lend evidence for conservation of design principles in the taste thalamus across species or across sensory thalamus in general, we characterized the ultrastructural and molecular properties of the VPMP in a close relative of primates, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), and compared these to known properties of the taste thalamus in rodent, and the visual thalamus in mammals. Electron microscopy analysis to categorize the synaptic inputs in the VPMP revealed that the largest‐size terminals contained many vesicles and formed large synaptic zones with thick postsynaptic density on multiple, medium‐caliber dendrite segments. Some formed triads within glomerular arrangements. Smaller‐sized terminals contained dark mitochondria; most formed a single asymmetric or symmetric synapse on small‐diameter dendrites. Immuno‐EM experiments revealed that the large‐size terminals contained VGLUT2, whereas the small‐size terminal populations contained VGLUT1 or ChAT. These findings provide evidence that the morphological and molecular characteristics of synaptic circuitry in the tree shrew VPMP are similar to that in nonchemical sensory thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the results indicate that all primary sensory nuclei of the thalamus in higher mammals share a structural template for processing thalamocortical sensory information. In contrast, substantial morphological and molecular differences in rodent versus tree shrew taste nuclei suggest a fundamental divergence in cellular processing mechanisms of taste input in these two species.

We used immunohistochemistry to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) in the brain of the Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina).







Abstract
Because of their roles in courtship and intrasexual competition, sexual displays are often sexually dimorphic, but we know little about the mechanisms that produce such dimorphism. Among mammals, one example is the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), which consists of a series of rapidly repeated, frequency‐modulated notes. The rate and duration of songs is sexually dimorphic and androgen responsive. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism, we map the sites of androgen sensitivity throughout the brain, focusing analysis along a pathway that spans from limbic structures to vocal motor regions. We find widespread expression of AR immunoreactivity (AR‐ir) throughout limbic structures important for social behavior and vocalization, including the lateral septum, extended amygdala, preoptic area and hypothalamus. We also find extensive AR staining along previously documented vocal motor pathways, including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus ambiguus, the last of which innervates intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Lastly, AR‐ir is also evident in sensory areas such as the medial geniculate, inferior, and superior colliculi. A quantitative analysis revealed that males exhibited more AR‐ir than females, a pattern that was most pronounced in the hypothalamus. Despite the elaboration of vocalization in singing mice, comparison with prior literature suggests that the broad pattern of AR‐ir may be conserved across a wide range of rodents. Together these data identify brain nuclei well positioned to shape the sexually dimorphic vocalization of S. teguina and suggest that such androgen modulation of vocalization is evolutionary conserved among rodents.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25107?af=R">Axon guidance at the spinal cord midline—A live imaging perspective</a></h4>

We describe a novel method to culture the intact spinal cord of the chicken embryo for live imaging of axon guidance at the midline. The stability of this ex vivo method allowed us to characterize key aspects of midline crossing, such as axonal growth, timing of crossing, dynamic morphological changes of the growth cones, and growth cone‐floor plate cell interactions.







Abstract
During neural circuit formation, axons navigate several choice points to reach their final target. At each one of these intermediate targets, growth cones need to switch responsiveness from attraction to repulsion in order to move on. Molecular mechanisms that allow for the precise timing of surface expression of a new set of receptors that support the switch in responsiveness are difficult to study in vivo. Mostly, mechanisms are inferred from the observation of snapshots of many different growth cones analyzed in different preparations of tissue harvested at distinct time points. However, to really understand the behavior of growth cones at choice points, a single growth cone should be followed arriving at and leaving the intermediate target. Existing ex vivo preparations, like cultures of an “open‐book” preparation of the spinal cord have been successfully used to study floor plate entry and exit, but artifacts prevent the analysis of growth cone behavior at the floor plate exit site. Here, we describe a novel spinal cord preparation that allows for live imaging of individual axons during navigation in their intact environment. When comparing growth cone behavior in our ex vivo system with snapshots from in vivo navigation, we do not see any differences. The possibility to observe the dynamics of single growth cones navigating their intermediate target allows for measuring growth speed, changes in morphology, or aberrant behavior, like stalling and wrong turning. Moreover, observation of the intermediate target—the floor plate—revealed its active participation and interaction with commissural axons during midline crossing.

Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple tissue (Tmt) opsins are putative blue‐light‐sensitive photoreceptor protein found in animals. The distributions of mRNA of opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain of medaka were investigated by in situ hybridization. These opsins are differentially expressed in the multiple retinal and brain regions.

Abstract
The photoreceptor protein, opsin, is one of the major components for vision and photoreceptive function in animals. Although many opsins have been discovered from animal genomes, only a few nonimage‐forming functions mediated by opsins have been identified. Understanding the mRNA distribution of photoreceptor proteins is one crucial step in uncovering their photoreceptive function in animals. Here, we focus on the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple opsin (Tmt) system, which constitutes a separate phylogenetic group, having putative blue light photoreceptors for nonimage‐forming functions. In medaka, there is one opn3 and five tmt‐opsin orthologs. The expression pattern of the opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain was investigated by in situ hybridization. mRNAs for opn3/tmt‐opsins were distributed in the retinal ganglion cells as well as interneurons and specific brain nuclei. Specifically, hybridization signals were observed in the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (gad1)‐expressing amacrine cells for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, and tmt2, in the caudal lobe of the cerebellum for tmt1b and tmt2, in the cranial nerve nuclei for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, tmt2, and in the rostral pars distalis (adenohypophysis) for opn3. These expression patterns suggest that blue light sensing in the fish retina and brain may be involved in the integration of visual inputs, vestibular function, somatosensation, motor outputs, and pituitary endocrine regulation.

Traditional image analysis techniques fail to determine the morphological changes astrocytes undergo following inflammation. Developing an automated segmentation workflow allowed us to extract morphological data of GFAP or ALDH1L1 positive objects. Using principal component analysis and random forests, we were able to determine the features most important for identifying whether an astrocyte was baseline or reactive. To further determine the changes, different segmented cellular astrocyte components underwent (i.e., the body or process), we performed k‐means clustering. Multiple, well‐validated machine learning approaches allowed us to determine astrocytes undergo a region‐specific heterogenous morphological change following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).







Abstract
Evaluation of reactive astrogliosis by neuroanatomical assays represents a common experimental outcome for neuroanatomists. The literature demonstrates several conflicting results as to the accuracy of such measures. We posited that the diverging results within the neuroanatomy literature were due to suboptimal analytical workflows in addition to astrocyte regional heterogeneity. We therefore generated an automated segmentation workflow to extract features of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, member L1 (ALDH1L1) labeled astrocytes with and without neuroinflammation. We achieved this by capturing multiplexed immunofluorescent confocal images of mouse brains treated with either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by implementation of our workflows. Using classical image analysis techniques focused on pixel intensity only, we were unable to identify differences between vehicle‐treated and LPS‐treated animals. However, when utilizing machine learning–based algorithms, we were able to (1) accurately predict which objects were derived from GFAP or ALDH1L1‐stained images indicating that GFAP and ALDH1L1 highlight distinct morphological aspects of astrocytes, (2) we could predict which neuroanatomical region the segmented GFAP or ALDH1L1 object had been derived from, indicating that morphological features of astrocytes change as a function of neuroanatomical location. (3) We discovered a statistically significant, albeit not highly accurate, prediction of which objects had come from LPS versus vehicle‐treated animals, indicating that although features exist capable of distinguishing LPS‐treated versus vehicle‐treated GFAP and ALDH1L1‐segmented objects, that significant overlap between morphologies exists. We further determined that for most classification scenarios, nonlinear models were required for improved treatment class designations. We propose that unbiased automated image analysis techniques coupled with well‐validated machine learning tools represent highly useful models capable of providing insights into neuroanatomical assays.

Using antibodies to calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the monkey basolateral amygdala (BNC) it was shown that virtually all PNs in the BNC express type 1 muscarinic receptors (m1Rs). Additional studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and 60% of parvalbumin immunoreactive INs (PV) were also m1R+. These results indicate that expression of m1Rs in BNC INs is greater in the monkey versus the rat.







Abstract
The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) of the amygdala plays an important role in the generation of emotional/motivational behavior and the consolidation of emotional memories. Activation of M1 cholinergic receptors (M1Rs) in the BNC is critical for memory consolidation. Previous receptor binding studies in the monkey amygdala demonstrated that the BNC has a high density of M1Rs, but did not have sufficient resolution to identify which neurons in the BNC expressed them. This was accomplished in the present immunohistochemical investigation using an antibody for the m1 receptor (m1R). Analysis of m1Rs in the monkey BNC using immunoperoxidase techniques revealed that their expression was very dense in the BNC, and suggested that virtually all of the pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) in all of the BNC nuclei were m1R‐immunoreactive (m1R+). This was confirmed with dual‐labeling immunofluorescence using staining for calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for BNC PNs. However, additional dual‐labeling studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were also m1R+. Moreover, the finding that 60% of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive neurons were m1R+ indicated that this IN subpopulation was the main GAD+ subpopulation exhibiting m1R expression. The cholinergic innervation of the amygdala is greatly reduced in Alzheimer's disease and there is currently considerable interest in developing selective M1R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) to treat the symptoms. The results of the present study indicate that M1Rs in both PNs and INs in the primate BNC would be targeted by M1R PAMs.

This study shows that most glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial extended amygdala originate in a novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 during development.

Abstract
Deficits in social cognition and behavior are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. The medial extended amygdala, including the medial amygdala and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, is a key component of functional networks involved in sociality. However, this nuclear complex is highly heterogeneous and contains numerous GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron subpopulations. Deciphering the connections of different neurons is essential in order to understand how this structure regulates different aspects of sociality, and it is necessary to evaluate their differential implication in distinct mental disorders. Developmental studies in different vertebrates are offering new venues to understand neuronal diversity of the medial extended amygdala and are helping to establish a relation between the embryonic origin and molecular signature of distinct neurons with the functional subcircuits in which they are engaged. These studies have provided many details on the distinct GABAergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala, but information on the glutamatergic neurons is still scarce. Using an Otp‐eGFP transgenic mouse and multiple fluorescent labeling, we show that most glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala originate in a distinct telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), located at the transition between telencephalon and hypothalamus, which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 but not Nkx2.1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons of the medial amygdala, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of this neuron subtype in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.

Serial section immuno‐electron microscopy of gamma protocadherins (Pcdh‐γs), a subset of clustered protocadherins, at synapses in CA1. We characterized synaptic diameter and perforation status for synapses labeled with antibodies to Pcdh‐γs and found that they were larger with more frequent perforations. Results were confirmed by light level imaging of immunolabeled synapses. The results suggest that clustered protocadherins may mediate a late event in synaptic development. Bar = 500 nm.







Abstract
Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a family of ~60 cadherin‐like proteins (divided into subclasses α, β, and γ) that regulate dendrite morphology and neural connectivity. Their expression is controlled through epigenetic regulation at a gene cluster encoding the molecules. During neural development, Pcdhs mediate dendrite self‐avoidance in some neuronal types through an uncharacterized anti‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs are also important for dendritic complexity in cortical neurons likely through a pro‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs have also been postulated to participate in synaptogenesis and connectivity. Some synaptic defects were noted in knockout animals, including synaptic number and physiology, but the role of these molecules in synaptic development is not understood. The effect of Pcdh knockout on dendritic patterning may present a confound to studying synaptogenesis. We showed previously that Pcdh‐γs are highly enriched in intracellular compartments in dendrites and spines with localization at only a few synaptic clefts. To gain insight into how Pcdh‐γs might affect synapses, we compared synapses that harbored Pcdh‐γs versus those that did not for parameters of synaptic maturation including pre‐ and postsynaptic size, postsynaptic perforations, and spine morphology by light microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons and by serial section immuno‐electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1. In mature neurons, synapses immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs were larger in diameter with more frequent perforations. Analysis of spines in cultured neurons revealed that mushroom spines were more frequently immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs at their tips than thin spines. These results suggest that Pcdh‐γ function at the synapse may be related to promotion of synaptic maturation and stabilization.

<p>by Alexander Karollus, Žiga Avsec, Julien Gagneur</p>

The 5’ untranslated region plays a key role in regulating mRNA translation and consequently protein abundance. Therefore, accurate modeling of 5’UTR regulatory sequences shall provide insights into translational control mechanisms and help interpret genetic variants. Recently, a model was trained on a massively parallel reporter assay to predict mean ribosome load (MRL)—a proxy for translation rate—directly from 5’UTR sequence with a high degree of accuracy. However, this model is restricted to sequence lengths investigated in the reporter assay and therefore cannot be applied to the majority of human sequences without a substantial loss of information. Here, we introduced frame pooling, a novel neural network operation that enabled the development of an MRL prediction model for 5’UTRs of any length. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on fixed length randomized sequences, while offering better generalization performance on longer sequences and on a variety of translation-related genome-wide datasets. Variant interpretation is demonstrated on a 5’UTR variant of the gene HBB associated with beta-thalassemia. Frame pooling could find applications in other bioinformatics predictive tasks. Moreover, our model, released open source, could help pinpoint pathogenic genetic variants.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S7Wpt5o3RpI" width="1" />

Animals utilize a variety of active sensing mechanisms to perceive the world around them. Echolocating bats are an excellent model for the study of active auditory localization. The big brown bat (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>), for instance, employs active head roll movements during sonar prey tracking. The function of head rolls in sound source localization is not well understood. Here, we propose an echolocation model with multi-axis head rotation to investigate the effect of active head roll movements on sound localization performance. The model autonomously learns to align the bat’s head direction towards the target. We show that a model with active head roll movements better localizes targets than a model without head rolls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active head rolls also reduce the time required for localization in elevation. Finally, our model offers key insights to sound localization cues used by echolocating bats employing active head movements during echolocation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UuufKDeAocI" width="1" />

<p>by Felipe Dalvi-Garcia, Luis L. Fonseca, Ana Tereza R. Vasoncelos, Cecilia Hedin-Pereira, Eberhard O. Voit</p>

A major factor contributing to the etiology of depression is a neurochemical imbalance of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, which is caused by persistently high levels of circulating stress hormones. Here, a computational model is proposed to investigate the interplay between dopaminergic and serotonergic-kynurenine metabolism under cortisolemia and its consequences for the onset of depression. The model was formulated as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations represented with power-law functions. Parameter values were obtained from experimental data reported in the literature, biological databases, and other general information, and subsequently fine-tuned through optimization. Model simulations predict that changes in the kynurenine pathway, caused by elevated levels of cortisol, can increase the risk of neurotoxicity and lead to increased levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaceltahyde (DOPAL) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). These aldehydes contribute to alpha-synuclein aggregation and may cause mitochondrial fragmentation. Further model analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of both serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase decreased the levels of DOPAL and 5-HIAL and the neurotoxic risk often associated with depression. The mathematical model was also able to predict a novel role of the dopamine and serotonin metabolites DOPAL and 5-HIAL in the ethiology of depression, which is facilitated through increased cortisol levels. Finally, the model analysis suggests treatment with a combination of inhibitors of serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase as a potentially effective pharmacological strategy to revert the slow-down in monoamine neurotransmission that is often triggered by inflammation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YN2jFOWgSHo" width="1" />

Imbalances in this evaluation are thought to characterize mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). We present a novel application of the drift diffusion model (DDM) suited to quantify how offers of reward and aversiveness, and neural correlates thereof, are dynamically integrated to form decisions, and how such processes are altered in MDD. Hierarchical parameter estimation from the DDM demonstrated that the MDD group differed in three distinct reward-related parameters driving approach-based decision making. First, MDD was associated with reduced reward sensitivity, measured as the impact of offered reward on evidence accumulation. Notably, this effect was replicated in a follow-up study. Second, the MDD group showed lower starting point bias towards approaching offers. Third, this starting point was influenced in opposite directions by Pavlovian effects and by nucleus accumbens activity across the groups: greater accumbens activity was related to approach bias in controls but avoid bias in MDD. Cross-validation revealed that the combination of these computational biomarkers were diagnostic of patient status, with accumbens influences being particularly diagnostic. Finally, within the MDD group, reward sensitivity and nucleus accumbens parameters were differentially related to symptoms of perceived stress and depression. Collectively, these findings establish the promise of computational psychiatry approaches to dissecting approach-avoidance decision dynamics relevant for affective disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DKXfzqVazzc" width="1" />

<p>by Amanda M. Westman, Shayn M. Peirce, George J. Christ, Silvia S. Blemker</p>

Skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable capacity for repair and regeneration following a variety of injuries. When successful, this highly orchestrated regenerative process requires the contribution of several muscle resident cell populations including satellite stem cells (SSCs), fibroblasts, macrophages and vascular cells. However, volumetric muscle loss injuries (VML) involve simultaneous destruction of multiple tissue components (e.g., as a result of battlefield injuries or vehicular accidents) and are so extensive that they exceed the intrinsic capability for scarless wound healing and result in permanent cosmetic and functional deficits. In this scenario, the regenerative process fails and is dominated by an unproductive inflammatory response and accompanying fibrosis. The failure of current regenerative therapeutics to completely restore functional muscle tissue is not surprising considering the incomplete understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive the regeneration response in the setting of VML injury. To begin to address this profound knowledge gap, we developed an agent-based model to predict the tissue remodeling response following surgical creation of a VML injury. Once the model was able to recapitulate key aspects of the tissue remodeling response in the absence of repair, we validated the model by simulating the tissue remodeling response to VML injury following implantation of either a decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold or a minced muscle graft. The model suggested that the SSC microenvironment and absence of pro-differentiation SSC signals were the most important aspects of failed muscle regeneration in VML injuries. The major implication of this work is that agent-based models may provide a much-needed predictive tool to optimize the design of new therapies, and thereby, accelerate the clinical translation of regenerative therapeutics for VML injuries.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D01OdBMIsW8" width="1" />

In this work, we describe the CRIMSON (CardiovasculaR Integrated Modelling and SimulatiON) software environment. CRIMSON provides a powerful, customizable and user-friendly system for performing three-dimensional and reduced-order computational haemodynamics studies via a pipeline which involves: 1) segmenting vascular structures from medical images; 2) constructing analytic arterial and venous geometric models; 3) performing finite element mesh generation; 4) designing, and 5) applying boundary conditions; 6) running incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of blood flow with fluid-structure interaction capabilities; and 7) post-processing and visualizing the results, including velocity, pressure and wall shear stress fields. A key aim of CRIMSON is to create a software environment that makes powerful computational haemodynamics tools accessible to a wide audience, including clinicians and students, both within our research laboratories and throughout the community. The overall philosophy is to leverage best-in-class open source standards for medical image processing, parallel flow computation, geometric solid modelling, data assimilation, and mesh generation. It is actively used by researchers in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia. It has been applied to numerous clinical problems; we illustrate applications of CRIMSON to real-world problems using examples ranging from pre-operative surgical planning to medical device design optimization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K8iPIqRDqYc" width="1" />

<p>by Marco António Dias Louro, Mónica Bettencourt-Dias, Jorge Carneiro</p>

How cells control the numbers of its subcellular components is a fundamental question in biology. Given that biosynthetic processes are fundamentally stochastic it is utterly puzzling that some structures display no copy number variation within a cell population. Centriole biogenesis, with each centriole being duplicated once and only once per cell cycle, stands out due to its remarkable fidelity. This is a highly controlled process, which depends on low-abundance rate-limiting factors. How can exactly one centriole copy be produced given the variation in the concentration of these key factors? Hitherto, tentative explanations of this control evoked lateral inhibition- or phase separation-like mechanisms emerging from the dynamics of these rate-limiting factors but how strict centriole number is regulated remains unsolved. Here, a novel solution to centriole copy number control is proposed based on the assembly of a centriolar scaffold, the cartwheel. We assume that cartwheel building blocks accumulate around the mother centriole at supercritical concentrations, sufficient to assemble one or more cartwheels. Our key postulate is that once the first cartwheel is formed it continues to elongate by stacking the intermediate building blocks that would otherwise form supernumerary cartwheels. Using stochastic models and simulations, we show that this mechanism may ensure formation of one and only one cartwheel robustly over a wide range of parameter values. By comparison to alternative models, we conclude that the distinctive signatures of this novel mechanism are an increasing assembly time with cartwheel numbers and the translation of stochasticity in building block concentrations into variation in cartwheel numbers or length.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dLG8mK6ZcyM" width="1" />

<p>by Gina Rippon, Lise Eliot, Sarah Genon, Daphna Joel</p>

Sex/gender differences in the human brain attract attention far beyond the neuroscience community. Given the interest of nonspecialists, it is important that researchers studying human female–male brain difference assume greater responsibility for the accurate communication of their findings.

Mind your language! This Perspective article points out that the source of misreporting in the field of sex/gender differences can often be found in the unjustified overstatements used by researchers themselves in reporting their findings; caution is needed when addressing differences between human beings, and hype and hyperbole should be avoided.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ou624Zw8-Jk" width="1" />

<p>by Christine Damrau, Julien Colomb, Björn Brembs</p>

The biogenic amine octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA) are involved in controlling a plethora of different physiological and behavioral processes. The <i>tyramine-</i>ß-<i>hydroxylase</i> (<i>t</i>ß<i>h</i>) gene encodes the enzyme catalyzing the last synthesis step from TA to OA. Here, we report differential dominance (from recessive to overdominant) of the putative null <i>t</i>ß<i>h</i><sup>nM18</sup> allele in 2 behavioral measures in Buridan’s paradigm (walking speed and stripe deviation) and in proboscis extension (sugar sensitivity) in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. The behavioral analysis of transgenic <i>t</i>ß<i>h</i> expression experiments in mutant and wild-type flies as well as of OA and TA receptor mutants revealed a complex interaction of both aminergic systems. Our analysis suggests that the different neuronal networks responsible for the 3 phenotypes show differential sensitivity to <i>t</i>ß<i>h</i> gene expression levels. The evidence suggests that this sensitivity is brought about by a TA/OA opponent system modulating the involved neuronal circuits. This conclusion has important implications for standard transgenic techniques commonly used in functional genetics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zdxXDNHBaiU" width="1" />

Lentivirally packaged clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) library is transduced into glioblastoma cells (1,000 cells transduced/single guide RNA after drug selection), with transduced cells injected into the mouse cortex, and resected under fluorescence guidance after 2‐week growth. Fluorescence‐activated cell sorting isolates viable, transduced cells, and sequencing of tagged cells identifies specific gene knockdowns associated with in vivo growth.

Abstract
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)‐based genetic screens offer unbiased and powerful tools for systematic and specific evaluation of phenotypes associated with specific target genes. CRISPR screens have been utilized heavily in vitro to identify functional coding and noncoding genes in a large number of cell types, including glioblastoma (GB), though no prior study has described the evaluation of CRISPR screening in GB in vivo. Here, we describe a protocol for targeting and transcriptionally repressing GB‐specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in vivo, with tumor growth in the mouse cerebral cortex. Given the target‐specific parameters of each individual screen, we list general steps involved in transducing guide RNA libraries into GB tumor lines, maintaining sufficient coverage, as well as cortically injecting and subsequently isolating transduced screen tumor cell populations for analysis. Finally, in order to demonstrate the use of this technique to discern an essential lncRNA, HOTAIR, from a nonessential lncRNA, we injected a 1:1 (HOTAIR:control nonessential lncRNA knockdown) mixture of fluorescently tagged U87 GB cells into the cortex of eight mice, evaluating selective depletion of HOTAIR‐tagged cells at 2 weeks of growth. Fluorescently tagged populations were analyzed via flow cytometry for hiBFP (control knockdown) and green fluorescent protein (HOTAIR knockdown), revealing 17% (p = 0.007) decrease in fluorescence associated with HOTAIR knockdown relative to control. The described in vivo CRISPR screening methodology thus appears to be an effective option for identifying noncoding (and coding) genes affecting GB growth within the mouse cortex.

<p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures that surround specific neurons in the brain and spinal cord, appear during critical periods of development, and restrict plasticity during adulthood. Removal of PNNs can reinstate juvenile-like plasticity or, in cases of PNN removal during early developmental stages, PNN removal extends the critical plasticity period. PNNs surround mainly parvalbumin (PV)-containing, fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons in several brain regions. These inhibitory interneurons profoundly inhibit the network of surrounding neurons via their elaborate contacts with local pyramidal neurons, and they are key contributors to gamma oscillations generated across several brain regions. Among other functions, these gamma oscillations regulate plasticity associated with learning, decision making, attention, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. The detailed mechanisms by which PNN removal increases plasticity are only beginning to be understood. Here, we review the impact of PNN removal on several electrophysiological features of their underlying PV interneurons and nearby pyramidal neurons, including changes in intrinsic and synaptic membrane properties, brain oscillations, and how these changes may alter the integration of memory-related information. Additionally, we review how PNN removal affects plasticity-associated phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and paired-pulse ratio (PPR). The results are discussed in the context of the role of PV interneurons in circuit function and how PNN removal alters this function.</p>

<p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). The two current treatments [hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)], are insufficiently effective in addressing neurologic disease, in part due to the inability of lysosomal enzyme to cross the blood brain barrier. With a goal to more effectively treat neurologic disease, we have investigated the effectiveness of AAV-mediated IDUA gene delivery to the brain using several different routes of administration. Animals were treated by either direct intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, by intrathecal (IT) infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid, or by intranasal (IN) instillation of AAV9-IDUA vector. AAV9-IDUA was administered to IDUA-deficient mice that were either immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (CP), or immunotolerized at birth by weekly injections of human iduronidase. In animals treated by ICV or IT administration, levels of IDUA enzyme ranged from 3- to 1000-fold that of wild type levels in all parts of the microdissected brain. In animals administered vector intranasally, enzyme levels were 100-fold that of wild type in the olfactory bulb, but enzyme expression was close to wild type levels in other parts of the brain. Glycosaminoglycan levels were reduced to normal in ICV and IT treated mice, and in IN treated mice they were normalized in the olfactory bulb, or reduced in other parts of the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis showed extensive IDUA expression in all parts of the brain of ICV treated mice, while IT treated animals showed transduction that was primarily restricted to the hind brain with some sporadic labeling seen in the mid- and fore brain. At 6 months of age, animals were tested for spatial navigation, memory, and neurocognitive function in the Barnes maze; all treated animals were indistinguishable from normal heterozygous control animals, while untreated IDUA deficient animals exhibited significant learning and spatial navigation deficits. We conclude that IT and IN routes are acceptable and alternate routes of administration, respectively, of AAV vector delivery to the brain with effective IDUA expression, while all three routes of administration prevent the emergence of neurocognitive deficiency in a mouse MPS I model.</p>

<p>The Affect-tag solution measures physiological signals to deliver indicators derived from cognitive science. To provide the most accurate and effective results, a database of electrodermal activity (EDA) signals acquired using the Affect-tag A1 band was created. An experimental paradigm was designed to measure action-taking, autonomic regulation, cognitive load (CL), emotions, and stress, affects, and social stress. The Affect-tag emotional power (EP), emotional density (ED), and CL affective and cognitive indicators were refined based on the physiological responses of 48 participants during these tasks. Statistical significance was obtained for all indicators in tasks they were designed to measure, resulting in a total accuracy score of 89% for the combined indicators. Data obtained during this study will be further analyzed to define emotional and affective states.</p>

<p>A theoretical framework for the reinforcement learning of aesthetic biases was recently proposed based on brain circuitries revealed by neuroimaging. A model grounded on that framework accounted for interesting features of human aesthetic biases. These features included individuality, cultural predispositions, stochastic dynamics of learning and aesthetic biases, and the peak-shift effect. However, despite the success in explaining these features, a potential weakness was the linearity of the value function used to predict reward. This linearity meant that the learning process employed a value function that assumed a linear relationship between reward and sensory stimuli. Linearity is common in reinforcement learning in neuroscience. However, linearity can be problematic because neural mechanisms and the dependence of reward on sensory stimuli were typically nonlinear. Here, we analyze the learning performance with models including optimal nonlinear value functions. We also compare updating the free parameters of the value functions with the delta rule, which neuroscience models use frequently, vs. updating with a new Phi rule that considers the structure of the nonlinearities. Our computer simulations showed that optimal nonlinear value functions resulted in improvements of learning errors when the reward models were nonlinear. Similarly, the new Phi rule led to improvements in these errors. These improvements were accompanied by the straightening of the trajectories of the vector of free parameters in its phase space. This straightening meant that the process became more efficient in learning the prediction of reward. Surprisingly, however, this improved efficiency had a complex relationship with the rate of learning. Finally, the stochasticity arising from the probabilistic sampling of sensory stimuli, rewards, and motivations helped the learning process narrow the range of free parameters to nearly optimal outcomes. Therefore, we suggest that value functions and update rules optimized for social and ecological constraints are ideal for learning aesthetic biases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.637157">Muscle Synergies in Children Walking and Running on a Treadmill</a></h4>

<p>Muscle synergies reflect the presence of a common neural input to multiple muscles. Steering small sets of synergies is commonly believed to simplify the control of complex motor tasks like walking and running. When these locomotor patterns emerge, it is likely that synergies emerge as well. We hence hypothesized that in children learning to run the number of accompanying synergies increases and that some of the synergies’ activities display a temporal shift related to a reduced stance phase as observed in adults. We investigated the development of locomotion in 23 children aged 2–9 years of age and compared them with seven young adults. Muscle activity of 15 bilateral leg, trunk, and arm muscles, ground reaction forces, and kinematics were recorded during comfortable treadmill walking and running, followed by a muscle synergy analysis. We found that toddlers (2–3.5 years) and preschoolers (3.5–6.5 years) utilize a “walk-run strategy” when learning to run: they managed the fastest speeds on the treadmill by combining double support (DS) and flight phases (FPs). In particular the activity duration of the medial gastrocnemius muscle was weakly correlated with age. The number of synergies across groups and conditions needed to cover sufficient data variation ranged between four and eight. The number of synergies tended to be smaller in toddlers than it did in preschoolers and school-age children but the adults had the lowest number for both conditions. Against our expectations, the age groups did not differ significantly in the timing or duration of synergies. We believe that the increase in the number of muscle synergies in older children relates to motor learning and exploration. The ability to run with a FP is clearly associated with an increase in the number of muscle synergies.</p>

<p>The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates neurotransmission by transporting serotonin from the synapse into the pre-synaptic nerve terminal. Altered SERT function leads to several neurological diseases including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Accordingly SERT is the target for their pharmacological treatments, but also targeted by multiple drugs of abuse. Transport of serotonin by SERT is energized by the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of sodium. We used extensive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the process of sodium binding to SERT, which is the first step in the transport cycle that leads to serotonin uptake. Comparing data from 51 independent simulations, we find a remarkably well-defined path for sodium entry and could identify two transient binding sites, while observing binding kinetics that are comparable to experimental data. Importantly, the structure and dynamics of the sodium binding sites indicate that sodium binding is accompanied by an induced-fit mechanism that leads to new conformations and reduces local dynamics.</p>

<p>Cerebral ischemia is a devastating disease that affects many people worldwide every year. The neurodegenerative damage as a consequence of oxygen and energy deprivation, to date, has no known effective treatment. The ischemic insult is followed by an inflammatory response that involves a complex interaction between inflammatory cells and molecules which play a role in the progression towards cell death. However, there is presently a matter of controversy over whether inflammation could either be involved in brain damage or be a necessary part of brain repair. The inflammatory response is triggered by inflammasomes, key multiprotein complexes that promote secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. An early event in post-ischemic brain tissue is the release of certain molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from injured neurons which induce the expression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), a transcription factor involved in the activation of the inflammasome. There are conflicting observations related to the role of NF-κB. While some observe that NF-κB plays a damaging role, others suggest it to be neuroprotective in the context of cerebral ischemia, indicating the need for additional investigation. Here we discuss the dual role of the major inflammatory signaling pathways and provide a review of the latest research aiming to clarify the relationship between NF-κB mediated inflammation and neuronal death in cerebral ischemia.</p>

<p>Pio del Rio-Hortega was not only the discoverer of the microglia and oligodendroglia but also possibly the most prolific mentor of all Santiago Ramon y Cajal’s disciples (Nobel awardee in Physiology or Medicine 1906 and considered as the father of modern Neuroscience). Among Río-Hortega’s mentees, three exceptional women are frequently forgotten, chronologically: Pio’s niece Asunción Amo del Río who worked with Río-Hortega at Madrid, Paris, and Oxford; the distinguished British neuropathologist Dorothy Russell who also worked with Don Pío at Oxford; and Amanda Pellegrino de Iraldi, the last mentee in his career. Our present work analyzes the figures of these three women who were in contact and collaborated with Don Pío del Río-Hortega, describing the influences received and the impact on their careers and the History of Neuroscience. The present work completes the contribution of women neuroscientists who worked with Cajal and his main disciples of the Spanish Neurological School both in Spain (previous work) and in other countries (present work).</p>

<p>Neurodegeneration and axonal injury result in an increasing release of neurofilament light chain (NfL) into bodily fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Numerous studies have shown that NfL levels in CSF and blood are increased in neurodegenerative disorders and monitor neurodegeneration. Saliva is an easily accessible biofluid that could be utilized as a biofluid measurement of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers. In this study, for the first time, salivary NfL was measured and compared to plasma NfL in a consecutive cohort of patients referred to cognitive assessments. In two mixed memory clinic cohorts, saliva samples were taken from 152 patients, AD (n = 49), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 47), non-AD (n = 56), and also 17 healthy controls. In addition, 135 also had a matching plasma sample. All saliva and plasma samples were analyzed for NfL, and the association between saliva and plasma NfL and CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and beta amyloid 1–42 (Aβ42) were investigated. In total, 162/169 had quantifiable levels of salivary NfL by single molecule array (Simoa). No statistically significant differences were found in salivary NfL concentration across the diagnostic groups, but as expected, significant increases were found for plasma NfL in dementia cases (P &lt; 0.0001). There was no association between saliva and plasma NfL levels. Furthermore, saliva NfL did not correlate with CSF Aβ42, p-tau, or tau concentrations. In conclusion, NfL is detectable in saliva but does not reflect neurodegeneration in the brain.</p>

Abstract
Learning about general aspects, or content details, of space results in differentiated neuronal information encoding within the proximodistal axis of the hippocampus. These processes are tightly linked to long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD). Here, we explored the precise sites of encoding of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus that are mediated by information throughput from the perforant path. We assessed nuclear Homer1a‐expression that was triggered by electrophysiological induction of short and long forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and compared it to Homer1a‐expression that was triggered by LTP and LTD enabled by different forms of spatial learning. Plasticity responses were induced by patterned stimulation of the perforant path and were recorded in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving rats. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect experience‐dependent nuclear encoding of Homer1a in proximodistal hippocampal subfields. Induction of neither STP nor STD resulted in immediate early gene (IEG) encoding. Electrophysiological induction of robust LTP, or LTD, resulted in highly significant and widespread induction of nuclear Homer1a in all hippocampal subfields. LTP that was facilitated by novel spatial exploration triggered similar widespread Homer1a‐expression. The coupling of synaptic depression with the exploration of a novel configuration of landmarks resulted in localized IEG expression in the proximal CA3 region and the lower (infrapyramidal) blade of the DG. Our findings support that synaptic plasticity induction via perforant path inputs promotes widespread hippocampal information encoding. Furthermore, novel spatial exploration promotes the selection of a hippocampal neuronal network by means of LTP that is distributed in an experience‐dependent manner across all hippocampus subfields. This network may be modified during spatial content learning by LTD in specific hippocampal subfields. Thus, long‐term plasticity‐inducing events result in IEG expression that supports establishment and/or restructuring of neuronal networks that are necessary for long‐term information storage.

Objective
This multilanguage study used simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable noninvasive biomarkers of prodromal versus manifest α‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicenter study across the Czech, English, German, French, and Italian languages at 7 centers in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males), including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the 7 distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No differences in language that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared with the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &lt; 0.001). However, only PD (p &lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &lt; 0.001), and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis might provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>by Debolina Sarkar, Marine Landa, Anindita Bandyopadhyay, Himadri B. Pakrasi, Jonathan P. Zehr, Costas D. Maranas</p>

Marine nitrogen-fixing microorganisms are an important source of fixed nitrogen in oceanic ecosystems. The colonial cyanobacterium <i>Trichodesmium</i> and diatom symbionts were thought to be the primary contributors to oceanic N<sub>2</sub> fixation until the discovery of the unusual uncultivated symbiotic cyanobacterium UCYN-A (<i>Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa</i>). UCYN-A has atypical metabolic characteristics lacking the oxygen-evolving photosystem II, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the carbon-fixation enzyme RuBisCo and <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways for a number of amino acids and nucleotides. Therefore, it is obligately symbiotic with its single-celled haptophyte algal host. UCYN-A receives fixed carbon from its host and returns fixed nitrogen, but further insights into this symbiosis are precluded by both UCYN-A and its host being uncultured. In order to investigate how this syntrophy is coordinated, we reconstructed bottom-up genome-scale metabolic models of UCYN-A and its algal partner to explore possible trophic scenarios, focusing on nitrogen fixation and biomass synthesis. Since both partners are uncultivated and only the genome sequence of UCYN-A is available, we used the phylogenetically related <i>Chrysochromulina tobin</i> as a proxy for the host. Through the use of flux balance analysis (FBA), we determined the minimal set of metabolites and biochemical functions that must be shared between the two organisms to ensure viability and growth. We quantitatively investigated the metabolic characteristics that facilitate daytime N<sub>2</sub> fixation in UCYN-A and possible oxygen-scavenging mechanisms needed to create an anaerobic environment to allow nitrogenase to function. This is the first application of an FBA framework to examine the tight metabolic coupling between uncultivated microbes in marine symbiotic communities and provides a roadmap for future efforts focusing on such specialized systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y-NMG9Z_ThA" width="1" />

<p>by Lauren M. Lui, Torben N. Nielsen, Adam P. Arkin</p>

Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete genomes from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Some studies have attempted to extract complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes and often focus on species with circular genomes so they can help confirm completeness with circularity. However, less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled and published from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a semi-automated method called Jorg to help circularize small bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. In addition to 34 circular CPR genomes, we present one circular Margulisbacteria genome, one circular Chloroflexi genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA. Code and a tutorial for this method is available at https://github.com/lmlui/Jorg and is available on the DOE Systems Biology KnowledgeBase as a beta app.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_G9M9PLYt1w" width="1" />

With the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that may increase transmissibility and/or cause escape from immune responses, there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages. It was found that the B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1) variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, could be serendipitously detected by the Thermo Fisher TaqPath Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses, spike Δ69–70, would cause a “spike gene target failure” (SGTF) result. However, a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7, and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern (VOC) that lack spike Δ69–70, such as B.1.351 (also 501Y.V2), detected in South Africa, and P.1 (also 501Y.V3), recently detected in Brazil. We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a Δ3675–3677) in all 3 variants, which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a Δ3675–3677 as the primary target and spike Δ69–70 to differentiate, we designed and validated an open-source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Our assay can be rapidly deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence and spread of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UWIlwO-TkQI" width="1" />

The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global public health and economy unprecedentedly, requiring accelerating development of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) would greatly help advance the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, as well as the design of next generation recombinant vaccines. Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Importantly, one human NAb, termed PR1077, from the H2L2 platform and 2 humanized NAb, including PR953 and PR961, were further characterized and subjected for subsequent structural analysis. High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures unveiled novel epitopes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) for PR1077 and PR953, which directly compete with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding, and a novel non-blocking epitope on the neighboring site near RBM for PR961. Moreover, we further tested the antiviral efficiency of PR1077 in the Ad5-hACE2 transduction mouse model of COVID-19. A single injection provided potent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in either prophylactic or treatment groups. Taken together, these results shed light on the development of mAb-related therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-hk1OfkxHpc" width="1" />

Summary of the main results of the study.

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition, which leads to a permanent loss of functions below the injury site. The events which take place after SCI are characterized by cellular death, release of inhibitory factors, and inflammation. Many therapies have been studied to cure SCI, among them magnetic stimulation aims to reduce the secondary damages in particular by decreasing apoptosis, while, cellular transplantation promotes neuroregeneration by enhancing axonal regrowth. In the present study, we compared individually primary olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation and repetitive trans‐spinal magnetic stimulation (rTSMS) and then, we combined these two therapeutic approaches on tissue repair and functional recovery after SCI. To do so, SCIs were performed at Th10 level on female C57BL/6 mice, which were randomized into four groups: SCI, SCI + primary bOECs, SCI + STM, SCI + primary bulbar olfactory ensheathing cells (bOECs) + stimulation (STM). On these animals bioluminescence, immunohistological, and behavioral experiments were performed after SCI. Our results show that rTSMS has beneficial effect on the modulation of spinal scar by reducing fibrosis, demyelination, and microglial cell activation and by increasing the astroglial component of the scar, while, primary bOEC transplantation decreases microglial reactivity. At the opposite, locotronic experiments show that both treatments induce functional recovery. We did not observed any additional effect by combining the two therapeutic approaches. Taken together, the present study indicates that primary bOEC transplantation and rTSMS treatment act through different mechanisms after SCI to induce functional recovery. In our experimental paradigm, the combination of the two therapies does not induce any additional benefit.

Abstract
Neuron‐restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a zinc‐finger transcription factor that regulates expression of a diverse set of genes. However, NRSF function in brain development still remains elusive. In the present study, we generated NRSF‐conditional knockout (NRSF‐cKO) mice by hGFAP‐Cre/loxp system to study the effect of NRSF deficiency on brain development. Results showed that NRSF conditional knockout caused a smaller hippocampus and a thinner granule cell layer (GCL) in mice. Moreover, the reduction and disarrangement of GFAP+ cells in subgranular zone (SGZ) of NRSF‐cKO mice was accompanied with the decreased number of premature neurons, neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as well as compromising the majority of mitotically active cells. The analysis of postnatal development of hippocampus indicated the existence of an abnormality at postnatal day (P) 8, rather than at P1, in NRSF‐cKO mice, although the densities of Ki67+ cells with mitotic ability in dentate gyrus were relatively unaffected at P1 and P8. Meanwhile, NRSF deficiency led to abnormal organization of SGZ at P8 during postnatal development. RNA‐Seq analysis revealed 79 deregulated genes in hippocampus of NRSF‐cKO mice at P8, which were involved in p53 signal transduction, neuron migration and negative regulation of cell proliferation, etc. The deregulation of p53 pathway in NRSF‐cKO mice at P1 and P8 was evidenced, of which p21/Cdkn1a was accumulated in a portion of NSCs and NPCs in hippocampus during postnatal development. Together, these results, for the first time, revealed that NRSF could significantly influence the postnatal development of hippocampus, especially the formation of SGZ.

In 2013, our group examined the expression profiles of 50 genes to develop the continuum hypothesis of avian brain organization. It states that the subdivisions of the dorsal pallium develop continuously with those of the ventral pallium, resulting in a “partial mirror image” organization around the vestigial ventricle divide. However, these claims were challenged due to the small number of genes profiled. The present study uses RNA sequencing to profile the whole transcriptome (~20,000 genes) of the principal subdivisions of the avian telencephalon and confirms the remarkable molecularly similarities between the dorsal and ventral pallium. We recommend adopting a hierarchal nomenclature to reflect these robust molecular similarities.







Abstract
Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the vestigial ventricle represent distinct populations to those below it or similar populations. To test these two hypotheses, we profiled the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the vestigial ventricle boundary using RNA sequencing and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations above and below the ventricle were remarkably similar. Each subdivision in dorsal pallium (Wulst) had a corresponding molecular counterpart in the ventral pallium (dorsal ventricular ridge). In turn, each corresponding subdivision exhibited shared gene co‐expression modules that contained gene sets enriched in functional specializations, such as anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings are more in line with the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivision organization above and below the vestigial ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations (intercalated pallium, mesopallium, hyper‐nidopallium, and arcopallium) instead of seven (hyperpallium apicale, interstitial hyperpallium apicale, intercalated hyperpallium, hyperpallium densocellare, mesopallium, nidopallium, and arcopallium). We suggest adopting a more streamlined hierarchical naming system that reflects the robust similarities in gene expression, neural connectivity motifs, and function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of overall vertebrate brain evolution.

<p>The regulation of microRNA (miRNA) is closely related to methamphetamine (METH) addiction. Past studies have reported that miR-181a is associated with METH addiction, but the mechanism pathways remain elusive. On the basis of our past studies, which reported the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) mediated ubiquitin protein degradation of GABAAα1, which was involved in METH addiction. The present study, using qRT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis, further revealed that miR-181a may be indirectly responsible for the METH addiction and downregulation of GABAAα1 through the regulation of ERAD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634063">Advanced Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Along With Machine Learning Provides New Sensitive Measures of Tissue Pathology and Intra-Lesion Activity in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

<p>Tissue pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly complex, requiring multi-dimensional analysis. In this study, our goal was to test the feasibility of obtaining high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) metrics through single-shell modeling of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and investigate how advanced measures from single-shell HARDI and DTI tractography perform relative to classical DTI metrics in assessing MS pathology. We examined 52 relapsing-remitting MS patients who had 3T anatomical brain MRI and DTI. Single-shell HARDI modeling yielded 5 sub-voxel-based metrics, totalling 11 diffusion measures including 4 DTI and 2 tractography metrics. Based on machine learning of 3-dimensional regions of interest, we evaluated the importance of the measures through several tissue classification tasks. These included two within-subject comparisons: lesion versus normal appearing white matter (NAWM); and lesion core versus shell. Further, by stratifying patients as having high (above 75%<sup>ile</sup>) and low (below 25%<sup>ile</sup>) number of MS lesions, we also performed 2 classifications between subjects for lesions and NAWM respectively. Results showed that in lesion-NAWM analysis, HARDI orientation distribution function (ODF) energy, DTI fractional anisotropy (FA), and HARDI orientation dispersion index were the top three metrics, which together achieved 65.2% accuracy and 0.71 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In core-shell analysis, DTI mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity, and FA were the top three metrics, and MD dominated the classification, which achieved 59.3% accuracy and 0.59 AUROC alone. Between patients, FA was the leading feature in lesion comparisons, while ODF energy was the best in NAWM separation. Collectively, single-shell modeling of common diffusion data can provide robust orientation measures of lesion and NAWM pathology, and DTI metrics are most sensitive to intra-lesion abnormality. Combined analysis of both advanced and classical diffusion measures may be critical for improved understanding of MS pathology.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the recognition of emotions in people with sensory disabilities still represents a challenge due to the difficulty of generalizing and modeling the set of brain signals. In recent years, the technology that has been used to study a person’s behavior and emotions based on brain signals is the brain–computer interface (BCI). Although previous works have already proposed the classification of emotions in people with sensory disabilities using machine learning techniques, a model of recognition of emotions in people with visual disabilities has not yet been evaluated. Consequently, in this work, the authors present a twofold framework focused on people with visual disabilities. Firstly, auditory stimuli have been used, and a component of acquisition and extraction of brain signals has been defined. Secondly, analysis techniques for the modeling of emotions have been developed, and machine learning models for the classification of emotions have been defined. Based on the results, the algorithm with the best performance in the validation is random forest (RF), with an accuracy of 85 and 88% in the classification for negative and positive emotions, respectively. According to the results, the framework is able to classify positive and negative emotions, but the experimentation performed also shows that the framework performance depends on the number of features in the dataset and the quality of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a determining factor.</p>

<p>Hyperscanning studies using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been performed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying human-human interactions. In this study, we propose a novel methodological approach that is developed for fNIRS multi-brain analysis. Our method uses support vector regression (SVR) to predict one brain activity time series using another as the predictor. We applied the proposed methodology to explore the teacher-student interaction, which plays a critical role in the formal learning process. In an illustrative application, we collected fNIRS data of the teacher and preschoolers’ dyads performing an interaction task. The teacher explained to the child how to add two numbers in the context of a game. The Prefrontal cortex and temporal-parietal junction of both teacher and student were recorded. A multivariate regression model was built for each channel in each dyad, with the student’s signal as the response variable and the teacher’s ones as the predictors. We compared the predictions of SVR with the conventional ordinary least square (OLS) predictor. The results predicted by the SVR model were statistically significantly correlated with the actual test data at least one channel-pair for all dyads. Overall, 29/90 channel-pairs across the five dyads (18 channels 5 dyads = 90 channel-pairs) presented significant signal predictions withthe SVR approach. The conventional OLS resulted in only 4 out of 90 valid predictions. These results demonstrated that the SVR could be used to perform channel-wise predictions across individuals, and the teachers’ cortical activity can be used to predict the student brain hemodynamic response.</p>

<p>Synapses and circuits rely on homeostatic forms of regulation in order to transmit meaningful information. The Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well-studied synapse that shows robust homeostatic control of function. Most prior studies of homeostatic plasticity at the NMJ have centered on presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). PHP happens when postsynaptic muscle neurotransmitter receptors are impaired, triggering retrograde signaling that causes an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. As a result, normal levels of evoked excitation are maintained. The counterpart to PHP at the NMJ is presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD). Overexpression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) causes an increase in the amplitude of spontaneous events. PHD happens when the synapse responds to the challenge by decreasing quantal content (QC) during evoked neurotransmission—again, resulting in normal levels of postsynaptic excitation. We hypothesized that there may exist a class of molecules that affects both PHP and PHD. Impairment of any such molecule could hurt a synapse’s ability to respond to any significant homeostatic challenge. We conducted an electrophysiology-based screen for blocks of PHD. We did not observe a block of PHD in the genetic conditions screened, but we found loss-of-function conditions that led to a substantial deficit in evoked amplitude when combined with VGlut overexpression. The conditions causing this phenotype included a double heterozygous loss-of-function condition for genes encoding the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R —itpr) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and RyRs gate calcium release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological agents targeting IP<sub>3</sub>R and RyR recapitulated the genetic losses of these factors, as did lowering calcium levels from other sources. Our data are consistent with the idea that the homeostatic signaling process underlying PHD is especially sensitive to levels of calcium at the presynapse.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive impairment of motor and non-motor functions in aging people. Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.</p>

Incision causes neuronal sensitization and acute postoperative pain. After injury resolves, endogenous µ‐opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suppresses latent pain sensitization. Inhibiting MOR signaling, either systemically or within the CeA, unmasks latent sensitization, leading to reinstatement of hypersensitivity.
​

Abstract
Tissue injury induces a long‐lasting latent sensitization (LS) of spinal nociceptive signaling that is kept in remission by an opposing µ‐opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity. To test the hypothesis that supraspinal sites become engaged, we induced hindpaw inflammation, waited 3 weeks for mechanical hypersensitivity to resolve, and then injected the opioid receptor inhibitors naltrexone, CTOP or β‐funaltrexamine subcutaneously, and/or into the cerebral ventricles. Intracerebroventricular injection of each inhibitor reinstated hypersensitivity and produced somatic signs of withdrawal, indicative of LS and endogenous opioid dependence, respectively. In naïve or sham controls, systemic naloxone (3 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion, and systemic naltrexone (3 mg/kg) increased Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In LS animals tested 3 weeks after plantar incision, systemic naltrexone reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity and produced an even greater increase in Fos than in sham controls, particularly in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA. One third of Fos+ profiles co‐expressed protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), and 35% of PKCδ neurons co‐expressed tdTomato+ in Oprm1Cre::tdTomato transgenic mice. CeA microinjection of naltrexone (1 µg) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity only in male mice and did not produce signs of somatic withdrawal. Intra‐CeA injection of the MOR‐selective inhibitor CTAP (300 ng) reinstated hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. We conclude that MORs in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA prevent the transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.

<p>by Wei-Feng Guo, Xiangtian Yu, Qian-Qian Shi, Jing Liang, Shao-Wu Zhang, Tao Zeng</p>

In the past few years, a wealth of sample-specific network construction methods and structural network control methods has been proposed to identify sample-specific driver nodes for supporting the Sample-Specific network Control (SSC) analysis of biological networked systems. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation for these state-of-the-art methods. Here, we conducted a performance assessment for 16 SSC analysis workflows by using the combination of 4 sample-specific network reconstruction methods and 4 representative structural control methods. This study includes simulation evaluation of representative biological networks, personalized driver genes prioritization on multiple cancer bulk expression datasets with matched patient samples from TCGA, and cell marker genes and key time point identification related to cell differentiation on single-cell RNA-seq datasets. By widely comparing analysis of existing SSC analysis workflows, we provided the following recommendations and banchmarking workflows. (i) The performance of a network control method is strongly dependent on the up-stream sample-specific network method, and Cell-Specific Network construction (CSN) method and Single-Sample Network (SSN) method are the preferred sample-specific network construction methods. (ii) After constructing the sample-specific networks, the undirected network-based control methods are more effective than the directed network-based control methods.

In the year 2020, there were 105 different statutory insurance companies in Germany with heterogeneous regional coverage. Obtaining data from all insurance companies is challenging, so that it is likely that projects will have to rely on data not covering the whole population. Consequently, the study of epidemic spread in hospital referral networks using data-driven models may be biased. We studied this bias using data from three German regional insurance companies covering four federal states: AOK (historically “general local health insurance company”, but currently only the abbreviation is used) Lower Saxony (in Federal State of Lower Saxony), AOK Bavaria (in Bavaria), and AOK PLUS (in Thuringia and Saxony). To understand how incomplete data influence network characteristics and related epidemic simulations, we created sampled datasets by randomly dropping a proportion of patients from the full datasets and replacing them with random copies of the remaining patients to obtain scale-up datasets to the original size. For the sampled and scale-up datasets, we calculated several commonly used network measures, and compared them to those derived from the original data. We found that the network measures (degree, strength and closeness) were rather sensitive to incompleteness. Infection prevalence as an outcome from the applied susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model was fairly robust against incompleteness. At incompleteness levels as high as 90% of the original datasets the prevalence estimation bias was below 5% in scale-up datasets. Consequently, a coverage as low as 10% of the local population of the federal state population was sufficient to maintain the relative bias in prevalence below 10% for a wide range of transmission parameters as encountered in clinical settings. Our findings are reassuring that despite incomplete coverage of the population, German health insurance data can be used to study effects of patient traffic between institutions on the spread of pathogens within healthcare networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dPDd2pL_oQw" width="1" />

<p>by Andrew D. Marquis, Filip Jezek, David J. Pinsky, Daniel A. Beard</p>

The relationship between regional variabilities in airflow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) is a critical determinant of gas exchange efficiency in the lungs. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is understood to be the primary active regulator of ventilation-perfusion matching, where upstream arterioles constrict to direct blood flow away from areas that have low oxygen supply. However, it is not understood how the integrated action of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction affects oxygen transport at the system level. In this study we develop, and make functional predictions with a multi-scale multi-physics model of ventilation-perfusion matching governed by the mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Our model consists of (a) morphometrically realistic 2D pulmonary vascular networks to the level of large arterioles and venules; (b) a tileable lumped-parameter model of vascular fluid and wall mechanics that accounts for the influence of alveolar pressure; (c) oxygen transport accounting for oxygen bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in plasma; and (d) a novel empirical model of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted our vulnerability to novel infections.
Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission—successfully reducing the reproductive number <i>R</i> below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iLQxZVEzKNg" width="1" />

Understanding brain operation demands linking basic behavioral traits to cell-type specific dynamics of different brain-wide subcircuits. This requires a system to classify the basic operational modes of neurons and circuits. Single-cell phenotyping of firing behavior during ongoing oscillations in vivo has provided a large body of evidence on entorhinal–hippocampal function, but data are dispersed and diverse. Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in Hippocampome.org. We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data. By confronting the effect of brain state and recording methods, we highlight the equivalences and differences across conditions and offer a number of novel observations. We show how a heuristic approach based on oscillatory features of morphologically identified neurons can aid in classifying extracellular recordings of single cells and discuss future opportunities and challenges towards integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6XJULtpQ37M" width="1" />

Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6 CThNs) in primary somatosensory cortex of the rodent are morphologically diverse. This study shows that one class of L6 CThNs receives more widespread presynaptic inputs than the other and projects to different regions of the thalamic reticular nucleus, suggesting that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in somatosensory cortex.







Abstract
Although corticothalamic neurons (CThNs) represent the largest source of synaptic input to thalamic neurons, their role in regulating thalamocortical interactions remains incompletely understood. CThNs in sensory cortex have historically been divided into two types, those with cell bodies in Layer 6 (L6) that project back to primary sensory thalamic nuclei and those with cell bodies in Layer 5 (L5) that project to higher‐order thalamic nuclei and subcortical structures. Recently, diversity among L6 CThNs has increasingly been appreciated. In the rodent somatosensory cortex, two major classes of L6 CThNs have been identified: one projecting to the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM‐only L6 CThNs) and one projecting to both VPM and the posterior medial nucleus (VPM/POm L6 CThNs). Using rabies‐based tracing methods in mice, we asked whether these L6 CThN populations integrate similar synaptic inputs. We found that both types of L6 CThNs received local input from somatosensory cortex and thalamic input from VPM and POm. However, VPM/POm L6 CThNs received significantly more input from a number of additional cortical areas, higher order thalamic nuclei, and subcortical structures. We also found that the two types of L6 CThNs target different functional regions within the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Together, our results indicate that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in the somatosensory cortex and suggest that VPM‐only L6 CThNs regulate, via their more restricted circuits, sensory responses related to a cortical column while VPM/POm L6 CThNs, which are integrated into more widespread POm‐related circuits, relay contextual information.

<p>Cancer and cancer pain processes a major clinical challenge and the underlined mechanisms of pathogenesis remain elusive. We examined the specific changes in the transcriptomic profiles in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of rats with bone cancer and bone cancer pain (BCP) using RNA sequencing technology. The bone cancer and BCP was induced by tumor cells implantation (TCI) into the tibia bone cavity in adult female rats. One week after treatment, TCI caused up- and down-regulation of thousands of genes in DRG. These genes were mainly involved in the immune process, inflammatory response, and intracellular signaling transduction of carbohydrate and cytokine. The cAMP and calcium signaling pathways were the major processes in the initial responses. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis further showed that the genes for ion channels increased during day 1-7, while the genes for cytokine signaling pathways sustainedly increased during day 7-14 after TCI. The time courses of gene expression for ion channels and cytokines support their distinct roles in the early induction and late maintenance of BCP development. In addition, among the top 500 up- and down-regulated genes, 80-90% were unique for bone cancer pain as well as neuropathic and inflammatory pain, while less than 2% were shared among the three different forms of pain. This study reveals the uniqueness of mechanisms underlying bone cancer with pain, which is, to a large extent, differently from pain after acute inflammatory and nerve injury and provides novel potential targets of DEGs for bone cancer with pain.</p>

<p>The brain is the central nervous system that governs human activities. However, in modern society, more and more diseases threaten the health of the brain and nerves and spinal cord, making the human brain unable to conduct normal information interaction with the outside world. The rehabilitation training of the brain-computer interface can promote the nerve repair of the sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain diseases. Therefore, the research of brain-computer interface for motor imaging is of great significance for patients with brain diseases to restore motor function. Due to the characteristics of non-stationary, nonlinear, and individual differences of EEG signals, there are still many difficulties in the analysis and classification of EEG signals at this stage. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model was used to classify motor-imaging EEG signals, identify the user’s intention, and control external devices. Considering that single-modal features cannot represent the core information, this study uses a fusion feature that combines temporal and spatial features as the final feature data. The fusion features are input to the trained ELM classifier, and the final classification result is obtained. Two sets of BCI competition data in the BCI competition public database are used to verify the validity of the model. The experimental results show that the ELM model has achieved a classification accuracy of 0.7832 in the classification task of Data Sets IIb, which is higher than other comparison algorithms, and shows universal applicability among different subjects. In addition, the average recognition rate of this model in the Data Sets IIIa classification task reaches 0.8347, which has obvious advantages compared with the comparative classification algorithm. The classification effect is smaller than the classification effect obtained by the champion algorithm of the same project, which has certain reference value.</p>

<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited neurodegenerative conditions that share a characteristic feature of degeneration of the longest axons within the corticospinal tract, which leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Mutations of over 70 genes produce defects in various biological pathways: axonal transport, lipid metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shaping, mitochondrial function, and endosomal trafficking. HSPs suffer from an adequate therapeutic plan. Currently the treatments foreseen for patients affected by this pathology are physiotherapy, to maintain the outgoing tone, and muscle relaxant therapies for spasticity. Very few clinical studies have been conducted, and it’s urgent to implement preclinical animal studies devoted to pharmacological test and screening, to expand the rose of compounds potentially attractive for clinical trials. Small animal models, such as Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish, have been generated, analyzed, and used as preclinical model for screening of compounds and their effects. In this work, we briefly described the role of HSP-linked proteins in the organization of ER endomembrane system and in the regulation of ER homeostasis and stress as a common pathological mechanism for these HSP forms. We then focused our attention on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features of some recently identified molecules with antioxidant property, such as salubrinal, guanabenz, N-acetyl cysteine, methylene blue, rapamycin, and naringenin, and on their potential use in future clinical studies. Expanding the models and the pharmacological screening for HSP disease is necessary to give an opportunity to patients and clinicians to test new molecules.</p>

<p>Connectivity within the human connectome occurs between multiple neuronal systems—at small to very large spatial scales. Independent component analysis (ICA) is potentially a powerful tool to facilitate multi-scale analyses. However, ICA has yet to be fully evaluated at very low (10 or fewer) and ultra-high dimensionalities (200 or greater). The current investigation used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to determine the following: (1) if larger networks, or meta-networks, are present at low dimensionality, (2) if nuisance sources increase with dimensionality, and (3) if ICA is prone to overfitting. Using bootstrap ICA, results suggested that, at very low dimensionality, ICA spatial maps consisted of Visual/Attention and Default/Control meta-networks. At fewer than 10 components, well-known networks such as the Somatomotor Network were absent from results. At high dimensionality, nuisance sources were present even in denoised high-quality data but were identifiable by correlation with tissue probability maps. Artifactual overfitting occurred to a minor degree at high dimensionalities. Basic summary statistics on spatial maps (maximum cluster size, maximum component weight, and average weight outside of maximum cluster) quickly and easily separated artifacts from gray matter sources. Lastly, by using weighted averages of bootstrap stability, even ultra-high dimensional ICA resulted in highly reproducible spatial maps. These results demonstrate how ICA can be applied in multi-scale analyses, reliably and accurately reproducing the hierarchy of meta-networks, large-scale networks, and subnetworks, thereby characterizing cortical connectivity across multiple spatial scales.</p>

<p>Complex natural tasks likely recruit many different functional brain networks, but it is difficult to predict how such tasks will be represented across cortical areas and networks. Previous electrophysiology studies suggest that task variables are represented in a low-dimensional subspace within the activity space of neural populations. Here we develop a voxel-based state space modeling method for recovering task-related state spaces from human fMRI data. We apply this method to data acquired in a controlled visual attention task and a video game task. We find that each task induces distinct brain states that can be embedded in a low-dimensional state space that reflects task parameters, and that attention increases state separation in the task-related subspace. Our results demonstrate that the state space framework offers a powerful approach for modeling human brain activity elicited by complex natural tasks.</p>

<p>Biological neurons can be modeled with different levels of biophysical/biochemical details. The accuracy with which a model reflects the actual physiological processes and ultimately the information function of a neuron, can range from very detailed to a schematic phenomenological representation. This range exists due to the common problem: one needs to find an optimal trade-off between the level of details needed to capture the necessary information processing in a neuron and the computational load needed to compute 1 s of model time. An increase in modeled network size or model-time, for which the solution should be obtained, makes this trade-off pivotal in model development. Numerical simulations become incredibly challenging when an extensive network with a detailed representation of each neuron needs to be modeled over a long time interval to study slow evolving processes, e.g., development of the thalamocortical circuits. Here we suggest a simple, powerful and flexible approach in which we approximate the right-hand sides of differential equations by combinations of functions from three families: Polynomial, piecewise-Linear, Step (PLS). To obtain a single coherent framework, we provide four core principles in which PLS functions should be combined. We show the rationale behind each of the core principles. Two examples illustrate how to build a conductance-based or phenomenological model using the PLS-framework. We use the first example as a benchmark on three different computational platforms: CPU, GPU, and mobile system-on-chip devices. We show that the PLS-framework speeds up computations without increasing the memory footprint and maintains high model fidelity comparable to the fully-computed model or with lookup-table approximation. We are convinced that the full range of neuron models: from biophysical to phenomenological and even to abstract models, may benefit from using the PLS-framework.</p>

<p>The activity of the left and right central pattern generators (CPGs) is efficiently coordinated during locomotion. To achieve this coordination, the interplay between the CPG controlling one leg and that controlling another must be present. Previous findings in aquatic vertebrates and mammalians suggest that the alternate activation of the left and right CPGs is mediated by the commissural interneurons crossing the midline of the spinal cord. Especially, V0 commissural interneurons mediate crossed inhibition during the alternative activity of the left and right CPGs. Even in humans, phase-dependent modulation of the crossed afferent inhibition during gait has been reported. Based on those previous findings, crossed inhibition of the CPG in one leg side caused by the activation of the contralateral CPG is a possible mechanism underlying the coordination of the anti-phase rhythmic movement of the legs. It has been hypothesized that the activity of the flexor half center in the CPG inhibits the contralateral flexor half center, but crossed inhibition of the extensor half center is not present because of the existence of the double limb support during gait. Nevertheless, previous findings on the phase-dependent crossed inhibition during anti-phase bilateral movement of the legs are not in line with this hypothesis. For example, extensor activity caused crossed inhibition of the flexor half center during bilateral cycling of the legs. In another study, the ankle extensor was inhibited at the period switching from extension to flexion during anti-phase rhythmic movement of the ankles. In this review article, I provide a critical discussion about crossed inhibition mediating the coordination of the anti-phase bilateral rhythmic movement of the legs.</p>

<p>Several previous studies have reported atypicality in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the relatively small effect sizes prevent us from using these characteristics for diagnostic purposes. Here, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to partition the high-functioning ASD group (i.e., the ASD discovery group) into subgroups. A support vector machine (SVM) model was trained through the 10-fold strategy to predict Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores within the ASD discovery group (r = 0.30, P &lt; 0.001, n = 260), which was further validated in an independent sample (i.e., the ASD validation group) (r = 0.35, P = 0.031, n = 29). The neuroimage-based partition derived two subgroups representing severe versus mild autistic patients. We identified FCs that show graded changes in strength from ASD-severe, through ASD-mild, to controls, while the same pattern cannot be observed in partitions based on ADOS score. We also identified FCs that are specific for ASD-mild, similar to a partition based on ADOS score. The current study provided multiple pieces of evidence with replication to show that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) FCs could serve as neural biomarkers in partitioning high-functioning autistic individuals based on their symptom severity and showing advantages over traditional partition based on ADOS score. Our results also indicate a compensatory role for a frontocortical network in patients with mild ASD, indicating potential targets for future clinical treatments.</p>

Background<p>Kinarm Standard Tests (KSTs) is a suite of upper limb tasks to assess sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, which produces granular performance data that reflect spatial and temporal aspects of behavior (&gt;100 variables per individual). We have previously used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data using the Kinarm End-Point Lab (EP). Here, we performed PCA using data from the Kinarm Exoskeleton Lab (EXO), and determined agreement of PCA results across EP and EXO platforms in healthy participants. We additionally examined whether further dimensionality reduction was possible by using PCA across behavioral tasks.</p>Methods<p>Healthy participants were assessed using the Kinarm EXO (N = 469) and EP (N = 170–200). Four behavioral tasks (six assessments in total) were performed that quantified arm sensory and motor function, including position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)] and three motor tasks [Visually Guided Reaching (VGR), Object Hit (OH), and Object Hit and Avoid (OHA)]. The number of components to include per task was determined from scree plots and parallel analysis, and rotation type (orthogonal vs. oblique) was decided on a per-task basis. To assess agreement, we compared principal components (PCs) across platforms using distance correlation. We additionally considered inter-task interactions in EXO data by performing PCA across all six behavioral assessments.</p>Results<p>By applying PCA on a per task basis to data collected using the EXO, the number of behavioral parameters were substantially reduced by 58–75% while accounting for 76–87% of the variance. These results compared well to the EP analysis, and we found good-to-excellent agreement values (0.75–0.99) between PCs from the EXO and those from the EP. Finally, we were able to reduce the dimensionality of the EXO data across tasks down to 16 components out of a total of 76 behavioral parameters, which represents a reduction of 79% while accounting for 73% of the total variance.</p>Conclusion<p>PCA of Kinarm robotic assessment appears to capture similar relationships between kinematic features in healthy individuals and is agnostic to the robotic platform used for collection. Further work is needed to investigate the use of PCA-based data reduction for the characterization of neurological deficits in clinical populations.</p>

<p>Validated self-report measures of post-stroke fatigue are lacking. The Dutch Multifactor Fatigue Scale (DMFS) was translated into Danish, and response process evidence of validity was evaluated. DMFS consists of 38 Likert-rated items distributed on five subscales: Impact of fatigue (11 items), Signs and direct consequences of fatigue (9), Mental fatigue (7), Physical fatigue (6), and Coping with fatigue (5). Response processes to DMFS were investigated using a Three-Step Test-Interview (TSTI) protocol, and data were analyzed using Framework Analysis. Response processes were indexed on the following categories: (i) “congruent,” response processes were related to the subscale construct; (ii) “incongruent,” response processes were not related to the subscale construct; (iii) “ambiguous,” response processes were both congruent and incongruent or insufficient to evaluate congruency; and (iv) “confused,” participants did not understand the item. Nine adults were recruited consecutively 10–34 months post-stroke (median = 26.5) at an outpatient brain injury rehabilitation center in 2019 [five females, mean age = 55 years (SD = 6.3)]. Problematic items were defined as &lt;50% of response processes being congruent with the intended construct. Of the 38 items, five problematic items were identified, including four items of Physical fatigue and one of Mental fatigue. In addition, seven items posed various response difficulties to some participants due to syntactic complexity, vague terms, a presupposition, and a double-barrelled statement. In conclusion, findings elucidate the interpretative processes involved in responding to DMFS post-stroke, strengthen the evidence base of validity, and guide revisions to mitigate potential problems in item performance.</p>

Introduction<p>Similarities in morphology, physiological function, and neurophysiological findings between median and ulnar nerves are not unequivocal. Our previous study confirmed differences in motor fiber parameters between these nerves in healthy persons. We made an attempt to assess and compare the physiological parameters of different sensation modalities (temperature, pain, and vibration) in median and ulnar nerves.</p>Methods<p>The study was performed in 31 healthy, right-handed volunteers: 17 women, 14 men, mean age 44.8 ± 15.5 years. Standard sensory conduction tests in the median and ulnar nerves were performed together with the estimation of vibratory, temperature, and warm- and cold-induced pain thresholds in the C7 and C8 dermatomes on the palm, using quantitative sensory testing.</p>Results<p>There were no statistically significant differences in the standard sensory conduction test in the median and ulnar nerves across the whole group: between right and left hands, and between women and men. We revealed differences in the temperature and pain thresholds between these nerves, mainly in low temperature perception. There were no differences in estimated thresholds between sides or in female and male groups. The vibratory limits did not differ significantly between nerves, and subgroups.</p>Conclusion<p>The study confirmed the differences in the physiological sensory perception between the median and ulnar nerves. The median nerve is more sensitive to temperature stimulation than the ulnar nerve, but simultaneously less sensitive to pain-inducing temperature stimuli. These findings should be considered during the examination of hand nerve pathology.</p>

<p>Glutamate transporters typically remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In addition, all glutamate transporters have a chloride channel, which is opened upon glutamate binding to the transporter. There are five types of glutamate transporter (EAATs 1–5, excitatory amino acid transporters), which have distinct chloride conductances. Some EAATs that have low chloride conductances, remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft most effectively (e.g., EAAT1). By contrast, EAATs that have high chloride conductances, remove glutamate less effectively (e.g., EAAT5). We have studied EAAT5 in the retina. In the retina, light activates a chloride current, mediated by the glutamate activation of EAAT5. EAAT5 is not a significant contributor to lateral inhibition in the retina. Instead, it is the main source of autoinhibition to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). EAAT5-mediated inhibition has a substantial effect on synaptic transmission from RBCs to downstream retinal neurons.</p>

<p>Rod and cone pathways are segregated in the first stage of the retina: cones synapse with both ON- and OFF-cone bipolar cells while rods contact only rod bipolar cells. However, there is an exception to this specific wiring in that rods also contact certain OFF cone bipolar cells, providing a tertiary rod pathway. Recently, it has been proposed that there is even more crossover between rod and cone pathways. Physiological recordings suggested that rod bipolar cells receive input from cones, and ON cone bipolar cells can receive input from rods, in addition to the established pathways. To image their rod and cone contacts, we have dye-filled individual rod bipolar cells in the rabbit retina. We report that approximately half the rod bipolar cells receive one or two cone contacts. Dye-filling AII amacrine cells, combined with subtractive labeling, revealed most of the ON cone bipolar cells to which they were coupled, including the occasional blue cone bipolar cell, identified by its contacts with blue cones. Imaging the AII-coupled ON cone bipolar dendrites in this way showed that they contact cones exclusively. We conclude that there is some limited cone input to rod bipolar cells, but we could find no evidence for rod contacts with ON cone bipolar cells. The tertiary rod OFF pathway operates via direct contacts between rods and OFF cone bipolar cells. In contrast, our results do not support the presence of a tertiary rod ON pathway in the rabbit retina.</p>

<p>Dysfunction in the neurovascular unit (NVU) is a key component in the progressive deterioration of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is critical in vascular dementia. Recent studies have shown that inflammation plays early and perhaps causal roles in the pathogenesis of AD related to NVU damage, possibly in part by overactivating the aspartic acid protease activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which until now has almost solely been studied in the context of the β-amyloid cascade. In this study, we analyzed the relationship of BACE1 with astrocytes and blood vessels in human brains with sporadic and familial dementia [Autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD), and familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)] and how BACE1 inhibition affects astrocytes and endothelial cells under conditions of glutamate toxicity. Our results show increased BACE1, PHF (Paired helical filaments)-tau and GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein) immunoreactivity (IR) in the CA1 hippocampal regions of FAD and SAD brains. Furthermore, BACE1 immunoprecipitated with GFAP in tissue samples from all study cases, but their immunofluorescence close to (10 μm<sup>3</sup>) or overlapping blood vessels was only increased in FAD and SAD brains, and PHF-tau was present around the vessels mainly in FAD brains. Interestingly, the increased BACE1 levels were associated with reactive astrocytes, characterized by morphological changes and upregulation of GFAP under pathological and stressful conditions, and endothelial disruption by glutamate excitotoxicity, and these effects were reversed by BACE1 inhibition; further, BACE1-inhibited astrocytes protected endothelial cell integrity by preserving zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) distribution and decreasing the expression of inflammatory markers. Taken together, these findings suggest that BACE1 dysregulation in astrocytes may have a role in the alterations in NVU integrity implicated in neurodegeneration.</p>

Background<p>Cognitive reserve explains why subjects with more years of education, professional achievement, or participation in recreational activities show less cognitive decline with aging. We hypothesize that levels of recreational travel, education, occupation, systemic health, physical performance, and current cognitive activity levels affect the trajectory of cognitive function in older, healthy people in Poland.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Healthy, older people (N = 205) were examined and followed-up at 2 years. Participants completed physical and cognitive function assessments: including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its two subtests Delayed Recall (DR) and Verbal Fluency (VF), and Trail Making Test Part B (TMT B). Factors associated with cognitive functioning were also examined.</p>Results<p>The MMSE result significantly decreased over 2 years. No significant decrease in other cognitive tests was noted. However, the trajectory of cognitive tests results varied between individual participants. Percentage of variance of change was explained by the following predictors: 21 in MMSE, 24 in MoCA, 8 in DR, 25 in VF, and 24 in TMT B. Age and the presence of varicose veins were significantly linked to negative changes in MMSE and MoCA scores, while working in a professional occupational status associated with a higher score. The subgroup with varicose veins did worse on the Delayed Recall subtest of MoCA.</p>Conclusion<p>Cognitive reserve could be extended by proxies of reserve that are related to systemic health and travel activity. The latter is a combination of social, physical, and cognitive activity and potentially might serve as an intervention to improve cognitive function in older people. However, due to the limitations of this study, results should be interpreted with caution and needs to be replicated in the further studies.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly based on medical observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and associated outcomes. These studies demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical decision making, leading to increasingly systematic, informed diagnosis of PD.</p>

Objectives<p>Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) commonly occurs in older age. However, few studies of a possible link between age-related CAPD and diet in an older population have been conducted. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between eating habits and age-related CAPD in a population &gt;65 years, using cross-sectional and retrospective data obtained in the same population-based study about 12 years ago.</p>Methods<p>We selected 734 participants (403 men) from a large population-based study. For age-related CAPD assessment, we used the Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competitive Message test. Dietary habits were assessed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Associations between age-related CAPD and food groups/macro-and micronutrients were explored using adjusted logistic regression models.</p>Results<p>Age-related CAPD subjects consumed more dairy (111 vs. 98 g/d), olives and vegetable oil (63 vs. 52 g/d) and spirits (2 vs.1 g/d), and less fruits (536 vs. 651 g/d) in the cross-sectional analysis. Age-related CAPD subjects had a lower intake of potassium, vitamin C, and a higher fat intake. Further analyses identified dietary fiber as being inversely related to age-related CAPD.</p>Discussion<p>The present study provided evidence that the dietary hypotheses proposed for explaining the development of cognitive disorders in older age might also hold for age-related CAPD. Further data from other large and prospective population-based studies are needed for confirming these findings.</p>

<p>With the advent of the aging society, how to grow old healthily has become an important issue for the whole of society. Effective intervention strategies for healthy aging are most desired, due to the complexity and diversity of genetic information, it is a pressing concern to find a single drug or treatment to improve longevity. In this study, long-term administration of triterpenoids of Ganoderma lucidum (TGL) can mitigate brain physiological decline in normal aging mice. In addition, the age-associated pathological features, including cataract formation, hair loss, and skin relaxation, brown adipose tissue accumulation, the β-galactosidase staining degree of kidney, the iron death of spleen, and liver functions exhibit improvement. We used the APP/PS1 mice and 3 × Tg-AD mice model of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) to further verify the improvement of brain function by TGL and found that Ganoderic acid A might be the effective constituent of TGL for anti-aging of the brain in the 3 × Tg-AD mice. A potential mechanism of action may involve the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, prolonging of telomere length, and enhance autophagy, which allows for the removal of pathological metabolites.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of senile dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and exerting tremendous socioeconomic burden on all societies. Although definitive diagnosis of AD is often made in the presence of clinical manifestations in late stages, it is now universally believed that AD is a continuum of disease commencing from the preclinical stage with typical neuropathological alterations appearing decades prior to its first symptom, to the prodromal stage with slight symptoms of amnesia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI), and then to the terminal stage with extensive loss of basic cognitive functions, i.e., AD-dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have been developed in a search to meet the increasing clinical need of early detection and treatment monitoring for AD, with reference to the pathophysiological targets in Alzheimer's brain. These include the pathological aggregations of misfolded proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plagues and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), impaired neurotransmitter system, neuroinflammation, as well as deficient synaptic vesicles and glucose utilization. In this article we survey the various PET radiotracers available for AD imaging and discuss their clinical applications especially in terms of early detection and cognitive relevance.</p>

Background<p>White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are markers for cerebrovascular pathology, which are frequently seen in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Verbal fluency is often impaired especially in AD, but little research has been conducted concerning the specific effects of WMH on verbal fluency in MCI and AD.</p>Objective<p>Our aim was to examine the relationship between WMH and verbal fluency in healthy old age and pathological aging (MCI/AD) using quantified MRI data.</p>Methods<p>Measures for semantic and phonemic fluency as well as quantified MRI imaging data from a sample of 42 cognitively healthy older adults and 44 patients with MCI/AD (total n = 86) were utilized. Analyses were performed both using the total sample that contained seven left-handed/ambidextrous participants, as well with a sample containing only right-handed participants (n = 79) in order to guard against possible confounding effects regarding language lateralization.</p>Results<p>After controlling for age and education and adjusting for multiple correction, WMH in the bilateral frontal and parieto-occipital areas as well as the right temporal area were associated with semantic fluency in cognitively healthy and MCI/AD patients but only in the models containing solely right-handed participants.</p>Conclusion<p>The results indicate that white matter pathology in both frontal and parieto-occipital cerebral areas may have associations with impaired semantic fluency in right-handed older adults. However, elevated levels of WMH do not seem to be associated with cumulative effects on verbal fluency impairment in patients with MCI or AD. Further studies on the subject are needed.</p>

Adult female and male C57BL/6N mice voluntarily consumed either a 10‐day course of antimicrobials or a control (tap water). Results showed that the antimicrobials exerted sex‐specific effects on gut microbiome structure, open field behavior, cued aversive learning, and amygdala dendritic spine density (Figure created in https://biorender.com/).

Abstract
Gut microbiota influence numerous aspects of host biology, including brain structure and function. Growing evidence implicates gut microbiota in aversive conditioning and anxiety‐related behaviors, but research has focused almost exclusively on males. To investigate whether effects of gut dysbiosis on aversive learning and memory differ by sex, adult female and male C57BL/6N mice were orally administered a moderate dose of nonabsorbable antimicrobial medications (ATMs: neomycin, bacitracin, and pimaricin) or a control over 10 days. Changes in gut microbiome composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Open field behavior, cued aversive learning, context recall, and cued recall were assessed. Following behavioral testing, the morphology of basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neuron dendrites and spines was characterized. Results revealed that ATMs induced gut dysbiosis in both sexes, with stronger effects in females. ATMs also exerted sex‐specific effects on behavior and neuroanatomy. Males were more susceptible than females to microbial modulation of locomotor activity and anxiety‐like behavior. Females were more susceptible than males to ATM‐induced impairments in aversive learning and cued recall. Context recall remained intact, as did dendritic structure of BLA principal neurons. However, ATMs exerted a sex‐specific effect on spine density. A second experiment was conducted to isolate the effects of gut perturbation to cued recall. Extinction was also examined. Results revealed no effect of ATMs on cued recall or extinction, suggesting that gut dysbiosis preferentially impacts aversive learning. These data shed new light on how gut microbiota interact with sex to influence aversive conditioning, open field behavior, and BLA dendritic spine architecture.

Haverkamp et al. use various cell markers to study the buzzard, pigeon, and marmoset retina. They compare marker expression, cell densities, and the cellular organization of foveae.







Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates that we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds are largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labeled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells, which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also in the retina of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.

Abstract
Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.

We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role pf PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.






Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g. mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.

<p>by Timo Stein, Daniel Kaiser, Johannes J. Fahrenfort, Simon van Gaal</p>

The study of unconscious processing requires a measure of conscious awareness. Awareness measures can be either subjective (based on participant’s report) or objective (based on perceptual performance). The preferred awareness measure depends on the theoretical position about consciousness and may influence conclusions about the extent of unconscious processing and about the neural correlates of consciousness. We obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements from 43 subjects while they viewed masked faces and houses that were either subjectively or objectively invisible. Even for objectively invisible (perceptually indiscriminable) stimuli, we found significant category information in both early, lower-level visual areas and in higher-level visual cortex, although representations in anterior, category-selective ventrotemporal areas were less robust. For subjectively invisible stimuli, similar to visible stimuli, there was a clear posterior-to-anterior gradient in visual cortex, with stronger category information in ventrotemporal cortex than in early visual cortex. For objectively invisible stimuli, however, category information remained virtually unchanged from early visual cortex to object- and category-selective visual areas. These results demonstrate that although both objectively and subjectively invisible stimuli are represented in visual cortex, the extent of unconscious information processing is influenced by the measurement approach. Furthermore, our data show that subjective and objective approaches are associated with different neural correlates of consciousness and thus have implications for neural theories of consciousness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vSJuhJb1srA" width="1" />

In an effort to better utilize published evidence obtained from animal experiments, systematic reviews of preclinical studies are increasingly more common—along with the methods and tools to appraise them (e.g., SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation [SYRCLE’s] risk of bias tool). We performed a cross-sectional study of a sample of recent preclinical systematic reviews (2015–2018) and examined a range of epidemiological characteristics and used a 46-item checklist to assess reporting details. We identified 442 reviews published across 43 countries in 23 different disease domains that used 26 animal species. Reporting of key details to ensure transparency and reproducibility was inconsistent across reviews and within article sections. Items were most completely reported in the title, introduction, and results sections of the reviews, while least reported in the methods and discussion sections. Less than half of reviews reported that a risk of bias assessment for internal and external validity was undertaken, and none reported methods for evaluating construct validity. Our results demonstrate that a considerable number of preclinical systematic reviews investigating diverse topics have been conducted; however, their quality of reporting is inconsistent. Our study provides the justification and evidence to inform the development of guidelines for conducting and reporting preclinical systematic reviews.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VYEOpxi7m5U" width="1" />

Abstract
In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae), a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body's morphology has been claimed as a homolog of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologs of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26098?af=R">Encephalitis with autoantibodies against the glutamate kainate receptors GluK2</a></h4>

Objective
To report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2/8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immunoabsorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or MRI features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis which in 2 caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (AMPAR and NMDAR) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinico‐radiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2.

<p>The development and function of the central nervous system rely on the microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons and their respective effectors. Although the structural role of the cytoskeleton has long been acknowledged in neuronal morphology and activity, it was recently recognized to play the role of a signaling platform. Following this recognition, research into Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs) diversified. Indeed, historically, structural MAPs—including MAP1B, MAP2, Tau, and MAP6 (also known as STOP);—were identified and described as MT-binding and -stabilizing proteins. Extensive data obtained over the last 20 years indicated that these structural MAPs could also contribute to a variety of other molecular roles. Among multi-role MAPs, MAP6 provides a striking example illustrating the diverse molecular and cellular properties of MAPs and showing how their functional versatility contributes to the central nervous system. In this review, in addition to MAP6’s effect on microtubules, we describe its impact on the actin cytoskeleton, on neuroreceptor homeostasis, and its involvement in signaling pathways governing neuron development and maturation. We also discuss its roles in synaptic plasticity, brain connectivity, and cognitive abilities, as well as the potential relationships between the integrated brain functions of MAP6 and its molecular activities. In parallel, the Collapsin Response Mediator Proteins (CRMPs) are presented as examples of how other proteins, not initially identified as MAPs, fall into the broader MAP family. These proteins bind MTs as well as exhibiting molecular and cellular properties very similar to MAP6. Finally, we briefly summarize the multiple similarities between other classical structural MAPs and MAP6 or CRMPs.In summary, this review revisits the molecular properties and the cellular and neuronal roles of the classical MAPs, broadening our definition of what constitutes a MAP.</p>

<p>In early development, the environment triggers mnemonic epigenomic programs resulting in memory and learning experiences to confer cognitive phenotypes into adulthood. To uncover how environmental stimulation impacts the epigenome and genome organization, we used the paradigm of environmental enrichment (EE) in young mice constantly receiving novel stimulation. We profiled epigenome and chromatin architecture in whole cortex and sorted neurons by deep-sequencing techniques. Specifically, we studied chromatin accessibility, gene and protein regulation, and 3D genome conformation, combined with predicted enhancer and chromatin interactions. We identified increased chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding including CTCF-mediated insulation, differential occupancy of H3K36me3 and H3K79me2, and changes in transcriptional programs required for neuronal development. EE stimuli led to local genome re-organization by inducing increased contacts between chromosomes 7 and 17 (inter-chromosomal). Our findings support the notion that EE-induced learning and memory processes are directly associated with the epigenome and genome organization.</p>

<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in nervous system formation and functioning, including metabolism. Present only in humans, the “Val66Met” polymorphism of the BDNF gene (BDNF) is suggested to have a negative influence on the etiology of neurological diseases. However, this polymorphism has only been addressed, at the molecular level, in nonhuman models. Knowledge about Val66- and Met66-variant differences, to date, has been achieved at the protein level using either cell culture or animal models. Thus, the purpose of our study was to analyze the impact of the Val66Met polymorphism on BDNF expression in healthy humans and compare the allele-specific responses to metabolic stress. Muscle biopsies from 13 male recreational athletes (34 ± 9 years, 1.80 ± 0.08 m, 76.4 ± 10.5 kg) were obtained before and immediately following a VO<sub>2</sub>max test. Allele-specific BDNF mRNA concentrations were quantified by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in heterozygous and homozygous subjects. The results indicated that BDNF expression levels were influenced by the genotype according to the presence of the polymorphism. BDNF expression from the Met66-coding alleles, in heterozygotes, was 1.3-fold lower than that from the Val66-coding alleles. Total BDNF mRNA levels in these heterozygotes remained below the whole sample’s mean. A partial dominance was detected for the Val66-coding variant on the Met66-coding’s. BDNF expression levels decreased by an average of 1.8-fold following the VO<sub>2</sub>max test, independent of the individual’s genotype. The results of this study indicate that metabolic stress downregulates BDNF expression but not plasma BDNF concentrations. No correlation between expression level and plasma BDNF concentrations was found.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage imaging is one of the most common applications of magnetic induction tomography (MIT). Depth and the mass of stroke stimulated (MSS) are the most important issues that need to be solved for this application. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique belonging to the deep brain stimulation (DBS) field, which aims at overcoming human diseases such as depression. TMS coils, namely, circular, figure-8, and H-coils, play an important role in TMS. Among these, H-coils individually focus on the issues of achieving effective stimulation of deep region. MIT and TMS mechanisms are similar. Herein, for the first time, improved TMS coils, including figure-8 and H-coils, are applied as MIT excitation coils to study the possibility of achieving the mass of stroke stimulated and deep detection through MIT. In addition, the configurations of the detection coils are varied to analyze their influence and determine the optimal coils array. Finally, MIT is used to detect haemorrhagic stroke occurring in humans, and the application of deep MIT to the haemorrhagic stroke problem is computationally explored. Results show that among the various coils, the improved H-coils have MSS and depth characteristics that enable the detection of deep strokes through MIT. Although the detecting depth of the figure-8 coil is weaker, its surface signal is good. The deep MIT technique can be applied to haemorrhagic detection, providing a critical base for deeper research.</p>

<p>Neurological disorders dramatically impact patients of any age population, their families, and societies. Pediatrics are among vulnerable age populations who differently experience the devastating consequences of neurological conditions, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), cerebral palsy, concussion, and epilepsy. System-level understanding of these neurological disorders, particularly from the brain networks' dynamic perspective, has led to the significant trend of recent scientific investigations. While a dramatic maturation in the network science application domain is evident, leading to a better understanding of neurological disorders, such rapid utilization for studying pediatric neurological disorders falls behind that of the adult population. Aside from the specific technological needs and constraints in studying neurological disorders in children, the concept of development introduces uncertainty and further complexity topping the existing neurologically driven processes caused by disorders. To unravel these complexities, indebted to the availability of high-dimensional data and computing capabilities, approaches based on machine learning have rapidly emerged a new trend to understand pathways better, accurately diagnose, and better manage the disorders. Deep learning has recently gained an ever-increasing role in the era of health and medical investigations. Thanks to its relatively more minor dependency on feature exploration and engineering, deep learning may overcome the challenges mentioned earlier in studying neurological disorders in children. The current scoping review aims to explore challenges concerning pediatric brain development studies under the constraints of neurological disorders and offer an insight into the potential role of deep learning methodology on such a task with varying and uncertain nature. Along with pinpointing recent advancements, possible research directions are highlighted where deep learning approaches can assist in computationally targeting neurological disorder-related processes and translating them into windows of opportunities for interventions in diagnosis, treatment, and management of neurological disorders in children.</p>

In this review article, we examine how retinal organoids can also contribute to our understanding of retinal developmental mechanisms, how this knowledge can be applied to modeling developmental abnormalities, and highlight some of the avenues that remain to be explored.</p>

<p>Low-dose atropine helps to control myopia progression with few side effects. However, the impact of atropine, a non-selective muscarinic Acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) remains unclear. After immersing the cornea and adjacent conjunctiva of enucleated eyes in 0.05% (approximately 800 μM) atropine solution for 30 min, the atropine concentration reached in the retina was below 2 μM. After direct superfusion of the retina with 1 μM atropine (considering that the clinical application of 0.05% atropine eye drops will be diluted over time due to tear flow for 30 min), no noticeable changes in the morphology of ON and OFF alpha RGCs (αRGCs) were observed. Atropine affected the light-evoked responses of ON and OFF αRGCs in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Direct application of less than 100 μM atropine on the retina did not affect light-evoked responses. The time latency of light-induced responses of ON or OFF αRGCs did not change after the application of 0.05–100 μM atropine for 5 min. However, 50 μM atropine extended the threshold of joint inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution of the RGCs. These results indicated that low-dose atropine (&lt;0.5 μM; equal to 1% atropine topical application) did not interfere with spike frequency, the pattern of synchronized firing between OFF αRGCs, or the threshold of joint ISI distribution of αRGCs. The application of atropine unmasked inhibition to induce ON responses from certain OFF RGCs, possibly via the GABAergic pathway, potentially affecting visual information processing.</p>

<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a non-coding CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. This mutation generates a toxic CUG RNA that interferes with the RNA processing of target genes in multiple tissues. Despite debilitating neurological impairment, the pathophysiological cascade of molecular and cellular events in the central nervous system (CNS) has been less extensively characterized than the molecular pathogenesis of muscle/cardiac dysfunction. Particularly, the contribution of different cell types to DM1 brain disease is not clearly understood. We first used transcriptomics to compare the impact of expanded CUG RNA on the transcriptome of primary neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes derived from DMSXL mice, a transgenic model of DM1. RNA sequencing revealed more frequent expression and splicing changes in glia than neuronal cells. In particular, primary DMSXL oligodendrocytes showed the highest number of transcripts differentially expressed, while DMSXL astrocytes displayed the most severe splicing dysregulation. Interestingly, the expression and splicing defects of DMSXL glia recreated molecular signatures suggestive of impaired cell differentiation: while DMSXL oligodendrocytes failed to upregulate a subset of genes that are naturally activated during the oligodendroglia differentiation, a significant proportion of missplicing events in DMSXL oligodendrocytes and astrocytes increased the expression of RNA isoforms typical of precursor cell stages. Together these data suggest that expanded CUG RNA in glial cells affects preferentially differentiation-regulated molecular events. This hypothesis was corroborated by gene ontology (GO) analyses, which revealed an enrichment for biological processes and cellular components with critical roles during cell differentiation. Finally, we combined exon ontology with phosphoproteomics and cell imaging to explore the functional impact of CUG-associated spliceopathy on downstream protein metabolism. Changes in phosphorylation, protein isoform expression and intracellular localization in DMSXL astrocytes demonstrate the far-reaching impact of the DM1 repeat expansion on cell metabolism. Our multi-omics approaches provide insight into the mechanisms of CUG RNA toxicity in the CNS with cell type resolution, and support the priority for future research on non-neuronal mechanisms and proteomic changes in DM1 brain disease.</p>

<p>When the non-coding repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene was discovered to be the most frequent cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2011, this gene and its derived protein, C9ORF72, were completely unknown. The mutation appeared to produce both haploinsufficiency and gain-of-function effects in the form of aggregating expanded RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). An unprecedented effort was then unleashed to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms and the functions of C9ORF72 in order to design therapies. A decade later, while the toxicity of accumulating gain-of-function products has been established and therapeutic strategies are being developed to target it, the contribution of the loss of function starts to appear more clearly. This article reviews the current knowledge about the C9ORF72 protein, how it is affected by the repeat expansion in models and patients, and what could be the contribution of its haploinsufficiency to the disease in light of the most recent findings. We suggest that these elements should be taken into consideration to refine future therapeutic strategies, compensating for the decrease of C9ORF72 or at least preventing a further reduction.</p>

<p>The vertebrate retina, like most other brain regions, undergoes relatively slow alterations in neural signaling in response to gradual changes in physiological conditions (e.g., activity changes to rest), or in response to gradual changes in environmental conditions (e.g., day changes into night). As occurs elsewhere in the brain, the modulatory processes that mediate slow adaptation in the retina are driven by extrinsic signals (e.g., changes in ambient light level) and/or by intrinsic signals such as those of the circadian (24-h) clock in the retina. This review article describes and discusses the extrinsic and intrinsic modulatory processes that enable neural circuits in the retina to optimize their visual performance throughout day and night as the ambient light level changes by ~10 billion-fold. In the first synaptic layer of the retina, cone photoreceptor cells form gap junctions with rods and signal cone-bipolar and horizontal cells (HCs). Distinct extrinsic and intrinsic modulatory processes in this synaptic layer are mediated by long-range feedback of the neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is released by dopaminergic cells, interneurons whose cell bodies are located in the second synaptic layer of the retina. Distinct actions of dopamine modulate chemical and electrical synapses in day and night. The retinal circadian clock increases dopamine release in the day compared to night, activating high-affinity dopamine D<sub>4</sub> receptors on cones. This clock effect controls electrical synapses between rods and cones so that rod-cone electrical coupling is minimal in the day and robust at night. The increase in rod-cone coupling at night improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the reliability of very dim multi-photon light responses, thereby enhancing detection of large dim objects on moonless nights.Conversely, maintained (30 min) bright illumination in the day compared to maintained darkness releases sufficient dopamine to activate low-affinity dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors on cone-bipolar cell dendrites. This non-circadian light/dark adaptive process regulates the function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on ON-cone-bipolar cell dendrites so that the receptive field (RF) surround of the cells is strong following maintained bright illumination but minimal following maintained darkness. The increase in surround strength in the day following maintained bright illumination enhances the detection of edges and fine spatial details.</p>

<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the spatial processing center of the brain and structurally is an interface between the three layered paleocortex and six layered neocortex, known as the periarchicortex. Limited studies indicate peculiarities in the formation of the EC such as early emergence of cells in layers (L) II and late deposition of LIII, as well as divergence in the timing of maturation of cell types in the superficial layers. In this study, we examine developmental events in the entorhinal cortex using an understudied model in neuroanatomy and development, the pig and supplement the research with BrdU labeling in the developing mouse EC. We determine the pig serves as an excellent anatomical model for studying human neurogenesis, given its long gestational length, presence of a moderate sized outer subventricular zone and early cessation of neurogenesis during gestation. Immunohistochemistry identified prominent clusters of OLIG2<sup>+</sup> oligoprogenitor-like cells in the superficial layers of the lateral EC (LEC) that are sparser in the medial EC (MEC). These are first detected in the subplate during the early second trimester. MRI analyses reveal an acceleration of EC growth at the end of the second trimester. BrdU labeling of the developing MEC, shows the deeper layers form first and prior to the superficial layers, but the LV/VI emerges in parallel and the LII/III emerges later, but also in parallel. We coin this lamination pattern parallel lamination. The early born Reln<sup>+</sup> stellate cells in the superficial layers express the classic LV marker, Bcl11b (Ctip2) and arise from a common progenitor that forms the late deep layer LV neurons. In summary, we characterize the developing EC in a novel animal model and outline in detail the formation of the EC. We further provide insight into how the periarchicortex forms in the brain, which differs remarkably to the inside-out lamination of the neocortex.</p>

<p>The cholinergic system has been shown to be the primary neurotransmitter system which is responsible for the cognitive symptoms associated with dementia; its role in healthy non-demented older adults remains a gap in the literature. Understanding the effects of age-related functional changes on the nicotinic system will address this knowledge gap. As the older adult population grows and hence the importance of understanding cognitive changes that impact functional abilities and everyday life. In this article we examine the benefits of using nicotine as a method for improving cognition in non-demented healthy older adults which may have the potential for slowing neurodegeneration in aging. Furthermore, we discuss how nicotine can play a crucial role in maintaining cognitive abilities throughout normal cognitive aging.</p>
