     alt="Attention Regulation Among Sleep-Deprived Air-Force Pilots"/>
<p>We physiologically quantify attentional and emotional dyregulations in combat pilots, following 24 h of sleep deprivation as well as to demonstrate recovery dynamics. Using machine learning, our measures were able to predict the aerial profession of the pilots, suggesting these measures as a potential physiomarker for quantifying attentional and emotional regulations.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Short sleep duration is associated with adverse physical and mental events. However, it is quite challenging to objectively quantify its impact on human cognitive performance. Thus, we aim to examine the effects of sleep deprivation on physiological measures of emotional and attention regulation, in terms of recovery dynamics among sleep-deprived air force pilots. Ninety-one pilots participated in a sleep deprivation workshop held by an aeromedical center. The Auditory Sustained Attention Test (ASAT) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test were applied to evaluate emotional and attention performance at baseline, post 24-h of sleep deprivation, following recovery of 3- and 8-h of sleep. Machine learning was used to predict the aerial professions based on the physiological measures. The results indicate that 24 h of sleep deprivation induced impairments in both attention and emotional regulation; however, while 3 h of sleep recovery have ameliorated emotional regulation and latency to response inhibition, attention performance required 8 h of sleep to ameliorate the observed 70% impairment. The physiologically measured adverse effects induced by sleep deprivation were distinctive among aerial professions, thus allowing machine learning prediction with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The effects of sleep-deprivation-induced fatigue were detected by the ASAT measures, which may be utilized as an objective, non-invasive physiological measure to quantify emotional and attention regulation. The ability to monitor sleep effects in a fast and accurate manner may be beneficial for the competence assessment of pilots and promote safety, and the differentiation across the aerial professions may potentially improve individual suitability assessment, together with the consequences of sleep deprivation.</p>

                arXiv:2506.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI systems to behave in increasingly human-like ways, exhibiting planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across increasingly diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the models' internal architecture, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems that operate within situated contexts, where goals, feedback, and interactions shape behavior over time. This shift calls for a new scientific lens: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this paradigm emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07027">A Neuronal Model at the Edge of Criticality: An Ising-Inspired Approach to Brain Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neuronal network model inspired by the Ising model, where each neuron is a binary spin ($s_i = \pm1$) interacting with its neighbors on a 2D lattice. Updates are asynchronous and follow Metropolis dynamics, with a temperature-like parameter $T$ introducing stochasticity.
  To incorporate physiological realism, each neuron includes fixed on/off durations, mimicking the refractory period found in real neurons. These counters prevent immediate reactivation, adding biologically grounded timing constraints to the model.
  As $T$ varies, the network transitions from asynchronous to synchronised activity. Near a critical point $T_c$, we observe hallmarks of criticality: heightened fluctuations, long-range correlations, and increased sensitivity. These features resemble patterns found in cortical recordings, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality for optimal information processing.
  This simplified model demonstrates how basic spin interactions and physiological constraints can yield complex, emergent behavior, offering a useful tool for studying criticality in neural systems through statistical physics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07060">Less is More: some Computational Principles based on Parcimony, and Limitations of Natural Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning. Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints, parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded artificial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07341">Slow and Fast Neurons Cooperate in Contextual Working Memory through Timescale Diversity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural systems process information across a broad range of intrinsic timescales, both within and across cortical areas. While such diversity is a hallmark of biological networks, its computational role in nonlinear information processing remains elusive. In this study, we examine how heterogeneity in intrinsic neural timescales within the frontal cortex - a region central to cognitive control - enhances performance in a context-dependent working memory task. We develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) composed of units with distinct time constants to model a delayed match-to-sample task with contextual cues. This task demands nonlinear integration of temporally dispersed inputs and flexible behavioral adaptation. Our analysis shows that task performance is optimized when fast and slow timescales are appropriately balanced. Intriguingly, slow neurons, despite weaker encoding of task-relevant inputs, play a causal role in sustaining memory and improving performance. In contrast, fast neurons exhibit strong but transient encoding of input signals. These results highlight a division of computational roles among neurons with different timescales: slow dynamics support stable internal states, while fast dynamics enable rapid signal encoding. Our findings provide a mechanistic account of how temporal heterogeneity contributes to nonlinear information processing in neural circuits, shedding light on the dynamic architecture underlying cognitive flexibility.

                arXiv:2506.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research, the detailed study of blinks is crucial. They can be considered as noise, affecting the efficiency and accuracy of decoding users' cognitive states and intentions, or as potential features, providing valuable insights into users' behavior and interaction patterns. We introduce a large dataset capturing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, eye-tracking, high-speed camera recordings, as well as subjects' mental states and characteristics, to provide a multifactor analysis of eye-related movements. Four paradigms -- motor imagery, motor execution, steady-state visually evoked potentials, and P300 spellers -- are selected due to their capacity to evoke various sensory-motor responses and potential influence on ocular activity. This online-available dataset contains over 46 hours of data from 31 subjects across 63 sessions, totaling 2520 trials for each of the first three paradigms, and 5670 for P300. This multimodal and multi-paradigms dataset is expected to allow the development of algorithms capable of efficiently handling eye-induced artifacts and enhancing task-specific classification. Furthermore, it offers the opportunity to evaluate the cross-paradigm robustness involving the same participants.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06750">Bio-Inspired Classification: Combining Information Theory and Spiking Neural Networks -- Influence of the Learning Rules</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events, and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application constraints.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06898">NSD-Imagery: A benchmark dataset for extending fMRI vision decoding methods to mental imagery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction. Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction. We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07481">Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.

Abstract: Across the life sciences, an ongoing effort over the last 50 years has made data and methods more reproducible and transparent. This openness has led to transformative insights and vastly accelerated scientific progress. For example, structural biology and genomics have undertaken systematic collection and publication of protein sequences and structures over the past half-century, and these data have led to scientific breakthroughs that were unthinkable when data collection first began. We believe that neuroscience is poised to follow the same path, and that principles of open data and open science will transform our understanding of the nervous system in ways that are impossible to predict at the moment. To this end, new social structures along with active and open scientific communities are essential to facilitate and expand the still limited adoption of open science practices in our field. Unified by shared values of openness, we set out to organize a symposium for Open Data in Neuroscience (ODIN) to strengthen our community and facilitate transformative neuroscience research at large. In this report, we share what we learned during this first ODIN event. We also lay out plans for how to grow this movement, document emerging conversations, and propose a path toward a better and more transparent science of tomorrow.

                arXiv:2408.11884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep staging is critical to assess sleep quality and diagnose disorders. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages. The code is available at https://github.com/Majy-Yuji/ST-USleepNet.

                arXiv:2502.15786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals into text has been a key challenge in the neuroscience community, with the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces and uncover deeper insights into brain mechanisms. However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose MindLLM, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. MindLLM consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate MindLLM on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by 12.0%, unseen subject generalization by 24.5%, and novel task adaptation by 25.0%. Furthermore, the attention patterns in MindLLM provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process.

                arXiv:2503.15487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscientists to study how large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed to image deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is computational imaging: the co-development of optics designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, with algorithms that compensate by inverting the optical coding to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopy video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the loss of information by 1) extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to effectively integrate the fluorescence of several lines into a single set of measurements and 2) imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame, NORA recovers full video sequences via nuclear-norm minimization on the pixels-by-time matrix, for which we prove theoretical guarantees on recovery. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulator, and used the simulations to demonstrate that NORA can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions. As NORA requires minimal changes to current microscopy systems, our results indicate that NORA can provide a promising avenue towards fast imaging of neural circuits.

                arXiv:2506.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task performance and neural data similarity.

                arXiv:2003.11660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Recurrent Neural Networks (RRNN) are the simplest recurrent networks to model and extract features from sequential data. The simplicity however comes with a price; RRNN are known to be susceptible to diminishing/exploding gradient problem when trained with gradient-descent based optimization. To enhance robustness of RRNN, alternative training approaches have been proposed. Specifically, FORCE learning approach proposed a recursive least squares alternative to train RRNN and was shown to be applicable even for the challenging task of target-learning, where the network is tasked with generating dynamic patterns with no guiding input. While FORCE training indicates that solving target-learning is possible, it appears to be effective only in a specific regime of network dynamics (edge-of-chaos). We thereby investigate whether initialization of RRNN connectivity according to a tailored distribution can guarantee robust FORCE learning. We are able to generate such distribution by inference of four generating principles constraining the spectrum of the network Jacobian to remain in stability region. This initialization along with FORCE learning provides a robust training method, i.e., Robust-FORCE (R-FORCE). We validate R-FORCE performance on various target functions for a wide range of network configurations and compare with alternative methods. Our experiments indicate that R-FORCE facilitates significantly more stable and accurate target-learning for a wide class of RRNN. Such stability becomes critical in modeling multi-dimensional sequences as we demonstrate on modeling time-series of human body joints during physical movements.

                arXiv:2506.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable programming has revolutionised optimisation by enabling efficient gradient-based training of complex models, such as Deep Neural Networks (NNs) with billions and trillions of parameters. However, traditional Evolutionary Computation (EC) and Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms, widely successful in discrete or complex search spaces, typically do not leverage local gradient information, limiting their optimisation efficiency. In this paper, we introduce EvoGrad, a unified differentiable framework that integrates EC and SI with gradient-based optimisation through backpropagation. EvoGrad converts conventional evolutionary and swarm operators (e.g., selection, mutation, crossover, and particle updates) into differentiable operators, facilitating end-to-end gradient optimisation. Extensive experiments on benchmark optimisation functions and training of small NN regressors reveal that our differentiable versions of EC and SI metaheuristics consistently outperform traditional, gradient-agnostic algorithms in most scenarios. Our results show the substantial benefits of fully differentiable evolutionary and swarm optimisation, setting a new standard for hybrid optimisation frameworks.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous values of weights and thresholds.

Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids. The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators. Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds, to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the 100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

                arXiv:2506.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality. Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving -- or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more scalable bilevel optimization.

                arXiv:2506.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-state spiking neurons such as the adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (AdLIF) neuron offer compelling alternatives to conventional deep learning models thanks to their sparse binary activations, second-order nonlinear recurrent dynamics, and efficient hardware realizations. However, such internal dynamics can cause instabilities during inference and training, often limiting performance and scalability. Meanwhile, state space models (SSMs) excel in long sequence processing using linear state-intrinsic recurrence resembling spiking neurons' subthreshold regime. Here, we establish a mathematical bridge between SSMs and second-order spiking neuron models. Based on structure and parametrization strategies of diagonal SSMs, we propose two novel spiking neuron models. The first extends the AdLIF neuron through timestep training and logarithmic reparametrization to facilitate training and improve final performance. The second additionally brings initialization and structure from complex-state SSMs, broadening the dynamical regime to oscillatory dynamics. Together, our two models achieve beyond or near state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances for reset-based spiking neuron models across both event-based and raw audio speech recognition datasets. We achieve this with a favorable number of parameters and required dynamic memory while maintaining high activity sparsity. Our models demonstrate enhanced scalability in network size and strike a favorable balance between performance and efficiency with respect to SSM models.

                arXiv:2506.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Representation learning via input reconstruction is a common technique in machine learning for generating representations that can be effectively utilized by arbitrary downstream tasks. A well-established approach is using autoencoders to extract latent representations at the network's compression point. These representations are valuable because they retain essential information necessary for reconstructing the original input from the compressed latent space. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning objective. Instead of using the raw input as the reconstruction target, we employ the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. The DFT provides meaningful global information at each frequency level, making individual frequency components useful as separate learning targets. When dealing with multidimensional input data, the DFT offers remarkable flexibility by enabling selective transformation across specific dimensions while preserving others in the computation. Moreover, certain types of input exhibit distinct patterns in their frequency distributions, where specific frequency components consistently contain most of the magnitude, allowing us to focus on a subset of frequencies rather than the entire spectrum. These characteristics position the DFT as a viable learning objective for representation learning and we validate our approach by achieving 52.8% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 and outperforming the traditional autoencoder by 12.8 points under identical architectural configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate that training on only the lower-frequency components - those with the highest magnitudes yields results comparable to using the full frequency spectrum, with only minimal reductions in accuracy.

                arXiv:2506.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting of airfoil aerodynamic performance is a key part of aircraft design optimization, but the traditional methods (such as wind tunnel test and CFD simulation) have the problems of high cost and low efficiency, and the existing data-driven models face the challenges of insufficient accuracy and strong data dependence in multi-objective prediction. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning model, Deeptrans, based on the fusion of improved Transformer and generative Adversarial network (GAN), which aims to predict the multi-parameter aerodynamic performance of airfoil efficiently. By constructing a large-scale data set and designing a model structure that integrates a Transformer coding-decoding framework and confrontation training, synchronous and high-precision prediction of aerodynamic parameters is realized. Experiments show that the MSE loss of Deeptrans on the verification set is reduced to 5.6*10-6, and the single-sample prediction time is only 0.0056 seconds, which is nearly 700 times more efficient than the traditional CFD method. Horizontal comparison shows that the prediction accuracy is significantly better than the original Transformer, GAN, and VAE models. This study provides an efficient data-driven solution for airfoil aerodynamic performance prediction and a new idea for deep learning modeling complex flow problems.

                arXiv:2506.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are machine learning models widely used for learning temporal relationships. Current state-of-the-art RNNs use integrating or spiking neurons -- two classes of computing units whose outputs depend directly on their internal states -- and accordingly there is a wealth of literature characterizing the behavior of large networks built from these neurons. On the other hand, past research on differentiating neurons, whose outputs are computed from the derivatives of their internal states, remains limited to small hand-designed networks with fewer than one-hundred neurons. Here we show via numerical simulation that large lattices of differentiating neuron rings exhibit local neural synchronization behavior found in the Kuramoto model of interacting oscillators. We begin by characterizing the periodic orbits of uncoupled rings, herein called ring oscillators. We then show the emergence of local correlations between oscillators that grow over time when these rings are coupled together into lattices. As the correlation length grows, transient dynamics arise in which large regions of the lattice settle to the same periodic orbit, and thin domain boundaries separate adjacent, out-of-phase regions. The steady-state scale of these correlated regions depends on how the neurons are shared between adjacent rings, which suggests that lattices of differentiating ring oscillator might be tuned to be used as reservoir computers. Coupled with their simple circuit design and potential for low-power consumption, differentiating neural nets therefore represent a promising substrate for neuromorphic computing that will enable low-power AI applications.

                arXiv:2506.06558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring systems in up to 3 dimensions with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent variational algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Max-Cut problem. A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.

                arXiv:2506.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown promise in tuning processor design parameters. However, standard BO does not support constraints involving categorical parameters such as types of branch predictors and division circuits. In addition, optimization time of BO grows with processor complexity, which becomes increasingly significant especially for FPGA-based soft processors. This paper introduces ASPO, an approach that leverages disjunctive form to enable BO to handle constraints involving categorical parameters. Unlike existing methods that directly apply standard BO, the proposed ASPO method, for the first time, customizes the mathematical mechanism of BO to address challenges faced by soft-processor designs on FPGAs. Specifically, ASPO supports categorical parameters using a novel customized BO covariance kernel. It also accelerates the design evaluation procedure by penalizing the BO acquisition function with potential evaluation time and by reusing FPGA synthesis checkpoints from previously evaluated configurations. ASPO targets three soft processors: RocketChip, BOOM, and EL2 VeeR. The approach is evaluated based on seven RISC-V benchmarks. Results show that ASPO can reduce execution time for the ``multiply'' benchmark on the BOOM processor by up to 35\% compared to the default configuration. Furthermore, it reduces design time for the BOOM processor by up to 74\% compared to Boomerang, a state-of-the-art hardware-oriented BO approach.

                arXiv:2506.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.

                arXiv:2506.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07121">Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming: Automated Generation of High-Quality and Diverse Attackers for Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method. Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies. Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of LLMs.

                arXiv:2506.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In critical situations, conventional mobile telephony fails to convey emergency voice messages to a callee already engaged in another call. The standard call waiting alert does not provide the urgency or content of the waiting call. This paper proposes a novel method for transmitting Generative Voice Bursts short, context aware audio messages during ongoing calls, from either preauthorized or dynamically prioritized callers. By leveraging generative AI techniques, the system automatically generates spoken messages from contextual inputs example like location, health data, images, background noise when the caller is unable to speak due to incapacitation or environmental constraints. The solution incorporates voice, text, and priority inference mechanisms, allowing high priority emergency messages to bypass conventional call waiting barriers. The approach employs models such as GPT Neo for generative text, which is synthesized into audio and delivered in configurable intervals G seconds and counts N times, ensuring minimal disruption while preserving urgency. This method holds potential for significant impact across telecom, mobile device manufacturing, and emergency communication platforms.

                arXiv:2506.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks. Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability, adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse, high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective scenarios.

                arXiv:2312.10290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper conducts the first rigorous runtime analysis of the SMS-EMOA for many-objective optimization. To this aim, we first propose a many-objective counterpart of the bi-objective OJZJ benchmark. We prove that SMS-EMOA computes the full Pareto front of this benchmark in an expected number of $O(\mu M n^k)$ iterations, where $n$ denotes the problem size (length of the bit-string representation), $k$ the gap size (a difficulty parameter of the problem), $M=(2n/m-2k+3)^{m/2}$ the size of the Pareto front, and $\mu$ the population size (at least the same size as the largest incomparable set). This result together with the existing negative result for the original NSGA-II shows that, in principle, the general approach of the NSGA-II is suitable for many-objective optimization, but the crowding distance as tie-breaker has deficiencies.
  We obtain three additional insights on the SMS-EMOA. Different from a recent result for the bi-objective \ojzj benchmark, a recently proposed stochastic population update often does not help for its many-objective counterpart. It at most results in a speed-up by a factor of order $2^{k} / \mu$, which is $\Theta(1)$ for large $m$, such as $m>k$. On the positive side, we prove that heavy-tailed mutation irrespective of the number $m$ of objectives results in a speed-up of order $k^{0.5+k-\beta}/e^k$. Finally, we conduct the first runtime analyses of the SMS-EMOA on the classic OMM and LOTZ and show that the SMS-EMOA has a performance comparable to the GSEMO and the NSGA-II.
  Our main technical insight, a general condition ensuring that the SMS-EMOA does not lose Pareto-optimal objective values, promises to be useful also in other runtime analyses of this algorithm.

                arXiv:2411.15111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate learnable activation functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs): comparing traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed and trainable activations against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that employ learnable basis functions. While PINNs effectively incorporate physical laws into the learning process, they suffer from convergence and spectral bias problems, which limit their applicability to problems with rapid oscillations or sharp transitions. In this work, we study various activation and basis functions across diverse PDEs, including oscillatory, nonlinear wave, mixed-physics, and fluid dynamics problems. Using empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis and Hessian eigenvalue decomposition, we assess convergence behavior, stability, and high-frequency approximation capacity. While KANs offer improved expressivity for capturing complex, high-frequency PDE solutions, they introduce new optimization challenges, especially in deeper networks. Our findings show that KANs face a curse of functional dimensionality, creating intractable optimization landscapes in deeper networks. Low spectral bias alone does not guarantee good performance; adaptive spectral bias approaches such as B-splines achieve optimal results by balancing global stability with local high-frequency resolution. Different PDE types require tailored strategies: smooth global activation functions excel for wave phenomena, while local adaptive activation functions suit problems with sharp transitions.

                arXiv:2505.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II and SMS-EMOA, the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) is one of the most prominent dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Different from the NSGA-II, it does not employ the crowding distance (essentially the distance to neighboring solutions) to compare pairwise non-dominating solutions but a complex system of $\sigma$-distances that builds on the distances to all other solutions. In this work, we give a first mathematical proof showing that this more complex system of distances can be superior. More specifically, we prove that a simple steady-state SPEA2 can compute optimal approximations of the Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark in polynomial time. The best proven guarantee for a comparable variant of the NSGA-II only assures approximation ratios of roughly a factor of two, and both mathematical analyses and experiments indicate that optimal approximations are not found efficiently.

                arXiv:2506.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors, RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6% while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

                arXiv:2010.00788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation can be used to optimize several different aspects of neural network architectures. For instance, the TaylorGLO method discovers novel, customized loss functions, resulting in improved performance, faster training, and improved data utilization. A likely reason is that such functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This paper demonstrates theoretically that this is indeed the case for TaylorGLO. Learning rule decomposition reveals that evolved loss functions balance two factors: the pull toward zero error, and a push away from it to avoid overfitting. This is a general principle that may be used to understand other regularization techniques as well (as demonstrated in this paper for label smoothing). The theoretical analysis leads to a constraint that can be utilized to find more effective loss functions in practice; the mechanism also results in networks that are more robust (as demonstrated in this paper with adversarial inputs). The analysis in this paper thus constitutes a first step towards understanding regularization, and demonstrates the power of evolutionary neural architecture search in general.

                arXiv:2310.06648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diversity plays a significant role in many problems, such as ensemble learning, reinforcement learning, and combinatorial optimization. How to define the diversity measure is a longstanding problem. Many methods rely on expert experience to define a proper behavior space and then obtain the diversity measure, which is, however, challenging in many scenarios. In this paper, we propose the problem of learning a behavior space from human feedback and present a general method called Diversity from Human Feedback (DivHF) to solve it. DivHF learns a behavior descriptor consistent with human preference by querying human feedback. The learned behavior descriptor can be combined with any distance measure to define a diversity measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DivHF by integrating it with the Quality-Diversity optimization algorithm MAP-Elites and conducting experiments on the QDax suite. The results show that the behavior learned by DivHF is much more consistent with human requirements than the one learned by direct data-driven approaches without human feedback, and makes the final solutions more diverse under human preference. Our contributions include formulating the problem, proposing the DivHF method, and demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments.

Abstract: We present a nonparametric interpretation for deep learning compatible modern Hopfield models and utilize this new perspective to debut efficient variants. Our key contribution stems from interpreting the memory storage and retrieval processes in modern Hopfield models as a nonparametric regression problem subject to a set of query-memory pairs. Interestingly, our framework not only recovers the known results from the original dense modern Hopfield model but also fills the void in the literature regarding efficient modern Hopfield models, by introducing \textit{sparse-structured} modern Hopfield models with sub-quadratic complexity. We establish that this sparse model inherits the appealing theoretical properties of its dense analogue -- connection with transformer attention, fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of our framework by constructing a family of modern Hopfield models as extensions, including linear, random masked, top-$K$ and positive random feature modern Hopfield models. Empirically, we validate our framework in both synthetic and realistic settings for memory retrieval and learning tasks.

                arXiv:2505.13551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance, meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition, human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under informational stress.

                Background Vehicle safety and stability are critical in the automotive industry, with aerodynamics playing a key role in enhancing these attributes. Spoilers, when effectively designed, can significantly influence airflow, downforce, and lift. This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of spoilers modeled as airfoils with adjustable trailing edges, aiming to dynamically control aerodynamic forces and improve vehicle stability and performance. Methods Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using ANSYS Fluent® to analyze the impact of varying trailing edge angles (AOTE) on aerodynamic forces. A detailed Tesla vehicle model was created in CATIA™, and simulations were performed across a speed range of 120–350 km/h. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) k–ω turbulence model was employed to ensure accurate flow prediction. A wind tunnel domain and grid independence validation were used to ensure numerical reliability. Boundary conditions included velocity inlets, pressure outlets, and no-slip wall boundaries. Results Adjusting the trailing edge angle produced significant variations in lift and downforce. At an angle of 30°, the negative lift (downforce) increased by up to 36%. At 0°, it increased by up to 17%. During acceleration phases, the controlled generation of positive lift improved aerodynamic efficiency, yielding a total lift increase of up to 15%. The simulated drag coefficient was 0.256, differing by 6% from Tesla’s reported value of 0.24, primarily due to mesh refinement level and geometric simplifications. Conclusions This study demonstrates that a spoiler with a movable trailing edge can significantly enhance vehicle handling, acceleration, and aerodynamic stability by actively modulating lift and downforce. The findings support the integration of active aerodynamic control systems in vehicle design. Future research will focus on control system development and experimental validation under real-world driving conditions.

                Background Previous studies compared the cardiorenal efficacy of these two types of SGLT2 inhibitors; however, the findings are inconsistent and do not reflect the population of Type 2 diabetic Mellitus (T2DM) patients in Indonesia, which ranks fifth globally in the number of diabetic patients. This study aims to evaluate the effects and safety of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on cardiorenal risk factors in T2DM Indonesian patients over a 12-month. Methods This study utilized a multicenter retrospective cohort to evaluate diverse cardiorenal risk factors, encompassing glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated 10-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), alongside the safety profile of SGLT2is. Paired data analysis, comparative analysis between groups, and linear regression were conducted to adjust the confounding. Results Both groups exhibited enhancements in HbA1c, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C). Improvements in BMI, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), triglycerides, ASCVD risk, and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) were only seen in the dapagliflozin group. The comparative study indicated that dapagliflozin markedly decreased body weight and BMI; however, the results became analogous between groups after correction for confounding variables. No significant differences were observed in the average alteration of HbA1c, FPG, SBP, DBP, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol, eGFR, and ASCVD risk values. A comparable safety profile was found between groups. Conclusion Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin provide similar advantages in reducing cardiorenal risk after 12 months of treatment in Indonesian patients with T2DM.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-568/v1?src=rss">An IoT BLE based system literature review of real time location monitoring and tracking to shorten patient wait times in Malaysian public hospitals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                One important performance metric in healthcare, particularly in Malaysia’s public hospitals, is patient turnaround time (PTAT). It describes the time that passes between receiving a patient’s request or sample and making a diagnosis or treatment decision. To guarantee prompt patient care, efficient treatment planning, and general healthcare quality, PTAT optimization is essential. Delays in public hospitals are often caused by complex procedures and inefficiencies in patient flow, particularly the lack of tracking when patients leave waiting areas. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA methodology to examine existing research on PTAT in healthcare. The findings highlight critical factors affecting PTAT in Malaysian hospitals, emphasizing the need for improved patient tracking systems to enhance operational efficiency and healthcare service delivery. It pinpoints recurring themes, knowledge gaps, and possible improvement opportunities. By knowing the elements driving PTAT, administrators, policymakers, and healthcare professionals can be better equipped to adopt measures for improvement. To overcome PTAT difficulties, our study emphasizes the significance of a real-time patient localization system utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This internet of things (IoT) based solution provides a unified strategy for enhancing turnaround times by enabling the real-time tracking of patient movements. The proposed method aims to achieve a PTAT of less than an hour by reducing waiting times by 35% through the integration of current technologies into a unified system. Achieving this objective would enhance the overall effectiveness of patient treatment and drastically reduce missed visits.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8 + T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunctions in type I interferon and CD8 + T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.

                <p>by Elisa Domíguez-Hüttinger, Eliezer Flores-Garza, José Luis Caldú-Primo, Harley Day, Abihail Roque Ramírez, Reiko J. Tanaka</p>

The epidermis is formed by layers of keratinocytes with increasing levels of differentiation towards the outer skin called skin barrier, which protects our body from environmental stressors and dehydration. When skin barrier is damaged, keratinocyte differentiation is triggered, and terminally differentiated keratinocytes express skin barrier components, achieving skin barrier homeostasis. However, the dynamic and quantitative understanding of how skin barrier homeostasis is achieved remains unknown. To elucidate how keratinocyte differentiation is dynamically affected by skin barrier damage, especially in the presence of infection, we developed a mechanistic model of keratinocyte differentiation by integrating experimental results from 101 manually curated publications. To extract the key regulatory structure of the model, we applied model reduction, called the kernel reduction methodology to obtain the minimal reaction network. The key regulatory structure is characterised by positive feedback with cooperativity between Np63 and Stat3, two master regulators of keratinocyte differentiation. This regulatory structure gives rise to bistable behaviour for the expression of terminal differentiation markers of keratinocytes when the skin barrier is damaged and the extracellular calcium level is varied. We validated the model by confirming it produces the history-dependent and switch-like keratinocyte differentiation observed in in vitro reversibility assays. Analysis of the validated model shows that bacterial infection augments keratinocytes’ sensitivity to skin barrier damage by decreasing the level required for differentiation and de-differentiation. Our results suggest the mechanisms by which skin barrier homeostasis is maintained even when the skin is exposed to fluctuating environments that perturb the barrier composition.

                <p>by Qi Sun, Ling-Hao Xu, Alan A. Stocker</p>

Accurate estimation of heading direction from optic flow is a crucial aspect of human spatial perception. Previous psychophysical studies have shown that humans are typically biased in their estimates of heading directions, but the reported results are inconsistent. While some studies found that humans generally underestimate heading direction (central bias), others observed the opposite, an overestimation of heading direction (peripheral bias). We conducted three psychophysical experiments showing that these conflicting findings may not reflect inherent differences in heading perception but can be attributed to the different sizes of the response range that participants were allowed to utilize when reporting their estimates. Notably, we show that participants’ heading estimates monotonically scale with the size of the response range, leading to underestimation for small and overestimation for large response ranges. Additionally, neither the speed profile of the optic flow pattern nor the response method (mouse vs. keyboard) significantly affected participants’ estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a Bayesian heading estimation model that can quantitatively account for participants’ heading reports. The model assumes efficient sensory encoding of heading direction according to a prior inferred from human heading discrimination data. In addition, the model assumes a response mapping that linearly scales the perceptual estimate with a scaling factor that monotonically depends on the size of the response range. This simple perception-action model accurately predicts participants’ estimates both in terms of mean and variance across all experimental conditions. Our findings underscore that human heading perception follows efficient Bayesian inference; differences in participants reported estimates can be parsimoniously explained as differences in mapping percept to probe response.

                <p>by Jessie Rademacher, Tineke Grent-‘t-Jong, Davide Rivolta, Andreas Sauer, Bertram Scheller, Guillermo Gonzalez-Burgos, Christoph Metzner, Peter J. Uhlhaas</p>

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, produces psychotomimetic effects when administered in sub-anesthetic dosages. While previous research suggests that Ketamine alters the excitation/inhibition (E/I)-balance in cortical microcircuits, the precise neural mechanisms by which Ketamine produces these effects are not well understood. We analyzed resting-state MEG data from n = 12 participants who were administered Ketamine to assess changes in gamma-band (30–90 Hz) power and the slope of the aperiodic power spectrum compared to placebo. In addition, correlations of these effects with gene-expression of GABAergic interneurons and NMDA-Rs subunits were analyzed. Finally, we compared Ketamine-induced spectral changes to the effects of systematically changing NMDA-R levels on pyramidal cells, and parvalbumin-, somatostatin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons in a computational model of cortical layer-2/3 to identify crucial sites of Ketamine action. Ketamine resulted in a flatter aperiodic slope and increased gamma-band power across brain regions, with pronounced effects in prefrontal and central areas. These effects were correlated with the spatial distribution of parvalbumin and GluN2D gene expression. Computational modeling revealed that reduced NMDA-R activity in parvalbumin or somatostatin interneurons could reproduce increased gamma-band power by increasing pyramidal neuron firing rate, but did not account for changes in the aperiodic slope. The results suggest that parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons may underlie increased gamma-band power following Ketamine administration in healthy volunteers, while changes in the aperiodic component could not be recreated. These findings have implications for current models of E/I-balance, as well as for understanding the mechanisms underlying the circuit effects of Ketamine.

Variation in bacterial composition inside a host is a result of complex dynamics of microbial community assembly, but little is known about these dynamics. To deconstruct the factors that contribute to this variation, we used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. We found that demographic stochasticity and stationary heterogeneity in the host carrying capacity or bacterial growth rate are insufficient to explain quantitatively the variation observed in our empirical data. Instead, we found that the data can be understood if the host-bacteria system can be viewed as stochastically switching between high and low growth rates phenotypes. This suggests the dynamics significantly more complex than logistic growth used in canonical models of microbiome assembly. We develop mathematical models of this process that can explain various aspects of our data. We highlight the limitations of snapshot data in describing variation in host-associated communities and the importance of using time-series data along with mathematical models to understand microbial dynamics within a host.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003226">Species-wide gene editing of a flowering regulator reveals hidden phenotypic variation</a></h4>

Genes do not act in isolation, and the effects of a specific variant at one locus can often be greatly modified by polymorphic variants at other loci. A good example is <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), which has been inferred to explain much of the flowering time variation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We use a set of 62 <i>flc</i> species-wide mutants to document pleiotropic, genotype-dependent effects for <i>FLC</i> on flowering as well as several other traits. Time to flowering was greatly reduced in all mutants, with the remaining variation explained mainly by allelic variation at the <i>FLC</i> target <i>FT</i>. Analysis of <i>FT</i> sequence variation suggested that extremely early combinations of <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> alleles should exist in the wild, which we confirmed by targeted collections. Our study provides a proof-of-concept on how pan-genetic analysis of hub genes can reveal the true extent of genetic networks in a species.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Moderate-to-late preterm (MLP) infants contribute to the greatest proportion of preterm children with neurodevelopmental impairments. White matter injury (WMI) is common and predicts adverse outcomes in very preterm (VP) infants. However, little is known about white matter abnormality (WMA) in MLP infants. We investigated the burden and distribution of WMA in MLP infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>MLP infants were recruited from a randomized trial on neonatal nutrition and a prospective observational cohort in New Zealand, and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) soon after birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA). WMA was manually segmented using an established method. Total and regional WMA volumes and percentage of WMA to total cerebral volume were calculated. Probabilistic WMA maps were generated and compared with WMI in VP infants and term infants with congenital heart disease.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 101 infants (32 females), 40 (39.6%) had WMA on at least 1 scan. In 37 infants with WMA who had both scans, WMA was less visible in 22 (59.5%) or undetectable in 7 (18.9%) infants with a mean reduction of 72.7 ± 207.5 mm<sup>3</sup> in WMA volume from early-life to term. Infants with and without WMA had mostly comparable pregnancy and neonatal characteristics. Probabilistic maps demonstrated a characteristic WMA topology, with most lesions in posterior followed by central and anterior regions. Trigonal areas were vulnerable across neonatal populations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>WMA is much more common in MLP infants than previously reported and occurs in a characteristic topology. WMA may be missed on TEA MRI, and its relationship with outcomes in MLP infants warrants attention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. Due to their decades of experience, it is felt by the farmers. Hadagali Jasmine comes under the GI Tag, hence they are authorised farmers. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali which also lead to an overall development of floriculture in India.

     alt="Executive Function Decline and Its Association With TNF-α in the Later Stages of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID"/>
<p>This study examined the long-term consequences of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) on Executive Functions (EFs) and its association with markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) were assessed. Results showed significant EF decline in PASC, inversely associated with serum TNF-α levels, persistent beyond 1 year post-infection. Increased levels of TNF-α were observed to be associated with poorer executive functioning in PASC.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Beyond the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, survivors often grapple with incapacitating post-infection symptoms, referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) when persistent beyond 90 days. Cognitive manifestations, encompassing attention, memory, and executive functions (EF), collectively termed brain fog, contribute to functional challenges in PASC. This infection also elicits a long-lasting pro-inflammatory response that persists even after viral clearance, potentially correlated with brain fog. However, it is unclear whether pro-inflammatory responses and cognitive sequelae persist beyond 1 year after the onset of infection. Thus, this study sought to investigate the long-term consequences of PASC on EFs as well as a potential association with markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC who passed performance validity testing (PVT) and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent neuropsychological assessments, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to assess global cognition, Victoria Stroop Test to assess inhibitory control, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to assess cognitive flexibility, Digit Span Task to assess working memory, and Mackworth Clock Test to assess sustained attention on the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) toolkit. Serum was assayed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Results indicate significant EF decline in PASC, inversely correlated with serum TNF-α concentrations, approximately 562 ± 225 days after the onset of infection. Thus, there exists protracted EF decline in PASC, persistent even beyond 1 year after the onset of infection. Increased levels of TNF-α are observed to be associated with poorer executive functioning in PASC.</p>

                Chen et al. demonstrate the mechanisms by which KRASG12D-mutant cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis. Under the circumstances of highly lactate production, ACAT2 facilitates the lactylation of GCLM at K34, which increases the enzymatic activity of the GCL and increases GSH synthesis, resulting in ferroptosis resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100037">Fat body-derived cytokine Upd2 controls disciplined migration of tracheal stem cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated activation and directional migration of adult stem cells are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. <i>Drosophila</i> tracheal progenitors are adult stem cells that migrate posteriorly along the dorsal trunk to replenish degenerating branches that disperse the fibroblast growth factor mitogen. However, it is currently unknown how the overall anterior-to-posterior directionality of such migration is controlled. Here, we show that individual progenitor cells migrate together in a concerted, disciplined manner, a behavior that is dependent on the neighboring fat body. We identify the fat body-derived cytokine, Upd2, in targeting and inducing JAK/STAT signaling in tracheal progenitors to maintain their directional migration. Perturbation of either Upd2 production in fat body or JAK/STAT signaling in trachea causes aberrant bidirectional migration of tracheal progenitors. We show that JAK/STAT signaling promotes the expression of genes involved in planar cell polarity leading to asymmetric localization of Fat in progenitor cells. We provide evidence that Upd2 transport requires Rab5- and Rab7-mediated endocytic sorting and Lbm-dependent vesicle trafficking. Our study thus uncovers an inter-organ communication in the control of disciplined migration of tracheal progenitor cells, a process that requires vesicular trafficking of fat body-derived cytokine Upd2 and JAK/STAT signaling-mediated activation of PCP genes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101338">Oviductin sets the species-specificity of the mammalian zona pellucida</a></h4>

              
                The zona pellucida (ZP) is vital for species-specific fertilization as this barrier mediates sperm-oocyte binding. Here, we determined whether sperm from distant mammalian orders (Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia) could penetrate bovine oocytes by examining the role of bovine oviductal fluid and species-specific oviductal glycoprotein (OVGP1 or oviductin) from bovine, murine, or human sources in modulating the species-specificity of bovine and murine oocytes. Sperm from all the species were found to penetrate intact bovine ovarian oocytes to form hybrid embryos. However, contact with oviductal fluid or bovine, murine, or human OVGP1, conferred the ZP species-specificity, allowing only the penetration of the corresponding sperm regardless of the ZP’s origin. Glycolytic and microstructural analyses revealed that OVGP1 covers the pores present in the ZP and that OVGP1 glycosylation determines sperm specificity. This suggests specific fertilization capacity is acquired in the oviduct through the ZP’s incorporation of specific oviductin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101197">Xist RNA binds select autosomal genes and depends on Repeat B to regulate their expression</a></h4>

              
                <i>Xist,</i> a pivotal player in X chromosome inactivation (XCI), has long been perceived as a cis-acting long noncoding RNA that binds exclusively to the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However, <i>Xist</i>’s ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that <i>Xist</i> RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that <i>Xist</i> RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to ~100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. <i>Xist</i> binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human <i>XIST</i> RNA. We find that <i>Xist</i> binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, <i>Xist</i> binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing <i>Xist</i> in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting <i>Xist</i>’s Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the <i>Xist</i> inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that <i>Xist</i> targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103620">Heterozygosity for neurodevelopmental disorder-associated TRIO variants yields distinct deficits in behavior, neuronal development, and synaptic transmission in mice</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variants in <i>TRIO</i> are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. TRIO uses its two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains to activate GTPases (GEF1: Rac1 and RhoG; GEF2: RhoA) that control neuronal development and connectivity. It remains unclear how discrete <i>TRIO</i> variants differentially impact these neurodevelopmental events. Here, we investigate how heterozygosity for NDD-associated <i>Trio</i> variants – <i>+/K1431M</i> (ASD), <i>+/K1918X</i> (SCZ)<i>,</i> and <i>+/M2145T</i> (bipolar disorder, BPD) – impacts mouse behavior, brain development, and synapse structure and function. Heterozygosity for different <i>Trio</i> variants impacts motor, social, and cognitive behaviors in distinct ways that model clinical phenotypes in humans. <i>Trio</i> variants differentially impact head and brain size, with corresponding changes in dendritic arbors of motor cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons (M1 L5 PNs). Although neuronal structure was only modestly altered in the <i>Trio</i> variant heterozygotes, we observe significant changes in synaptic function and plasticity. We also identified distinct changes in glutamate synaptic release in <i>+/K1431M</i> and <i>+/M2145T</i> cortico-cortical synapses. The TRIO K1431M GEF1 domain has impaired ability to promote GTP exchange on Rac1, but <i>+/K1431M</i> mice exhibit increased Rac1 activity, associated with increased levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1. Acute Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 rescued glutamate release deficits in <i>+/K1431M</i> variant cortex. Our work reveals that discrete NDD-associated <i>Trio</i> variants yield overlapping but distinct phenotypes in mice, demonstrates an essential role for Trio in presynaptic glutamate release, and underscores the importance of studying the impact of variant heterozygosity in vivo.

">Intrinsic plasticity underlies malleability of network heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Diversity exists throughout biology, playing an important role in maintaining robustness and stability. The same is true of the brain, as has become increasingly apparent in recent years with the accumulation of datasets of unparalleled resolution. These datasets show widespread neural heterogeneity, spanning cells, circuits and system dynamics, marking it as an unavoidable component of the brain's composition. Recent experiments found declines in heterogeneity amongst neurons may accompany pathological states. While heterogeneity has been linked to stability, robustness and increased computational potential, the loss of biophysical diversity was found conducive to the onset of seizure-like activity, suggesting an important functional role. Despite this, how changes in heterogeneity arise remains unknown. Oftentimes considered a static metaparameter resulting from solely genetic disposition, heterogeneity is, in fact, a highly dynamic property of biological networks arising from various sources. Here, we consider this through the lens of intrinsic plasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of neuron biophysical properties, which we propose allows the degree of biophysical diversity to fluctuate in time. Using a network of Poisson neurons endowed with intrinsic plasticity, we combine analytical and numerical approaches to measure the effect of input statistics on the excitability of individual cells, and how this translates into changes in network heterogeneity at the population scale. Our results indicate that, through intrinsic plasticity, diversity in synaptic inputs promotes heterogeneity in cell-to-cell excitability due to changes in the statistics of presynaptic firing rates, and network topology. In contrast, whenever the statistics of synaptic input between cells were too similar, intrinsic plasticity promoted the decline in heterogeneity. Further, we show that changes in heterogeneity can coexist with degeneracy in the firing rate between neurons. Taken together, understanding how input statistics affect neuronal network heterogeneity may provide key insights into brain function resilience and the manipulability of neural diversity through intrinsic plasticity.

">Altered GluN2A levels reduce the emergence of seizure-like events in a rat model of GRIN2A haploinsufficiency</a></h4>

              
                GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, encoded by the GRIN2A gene, are critical components of excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for proper brain development and function. Dysregulation of NMDA receptor activity is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. While excessive GluN2A-mediated signalling can lead to hyperexcitability and seizure generation, loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, which result in reduced GluN2A expression, have also been identified in patients with various forms of epilepsy, including focal epilepsies and epileptic encephalopathies. This paradox highlights the complexity of NMDA receptor contributions to network excitability and suggests that both gain- and loss-of-function mutations can be pathogenic. However, the mechanisms through which reduced GluN2A expression influences seizure susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of reduced and absence of GluN2A on seizure-like activity using in vitro model system. Hippocampal slices were prepared from wild-type littermate controls (Grin2a+/+), heterozygous (Grin2a+/-) and homozygous (Grin2a-/-) transgenic rats and subjected to pro-convulsant conditions to elicit epileptiform-like events. Specifically, we employed three well established in vitro epilepsy models: (i) 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), (ii) zero-magnesium with elevated potassium (0Mg2+/5K+), and (iii) high-potassium (high-K+). Local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal layer to quantify interictal and seizure-like activity, by measuring latency to onset, event frequency, and duration. Spectral analyses were also conducted to assess alterations in network dynamics. Our findings reveal that reduced GluN2A expression alters the susceptibility of hippocampal circuits to seizure-like activity in a model-dependent manner. In the 4-AP model, Grin2a-/- slices exhibited a significantly lower frequency of interictal events and a delayed onset of seizure-like activity relative to both wild-type and heterozygous slices. In the 0Mg2+/5K+ model, both Grin2a+/- and Grin2a-/- slices displayed reduced seizure susceptibility compared to wild-type. Finally, in the high-K+ model, Grin2a-/- slices showed a reduced incidence of seizure-like events compared to wild-type controls when extracellular potassium concentration was increased to 7.5 mM, although this effect was less apparent at higher concentrations (9.5 mM). These results suggest that partial or complete loss of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors reduces the propensity of hippocampal networks to develop epileptiform activity, potentially by altering intrinsic or synaptic excitability. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how GRIN2A loss-of-function variants may contribute to epilepsy and highlight the need to consider developmental and circuit-level compensations when interpreting the impact of GluN2A disruption.

">Pupil-linked arousal differentially modulates cell-type-specific sensory processing</a></h4>

              
                Arousal is a ubiquitous influence on the brain that fluctuates during wakefulness and modulates sensation and perception. These fluctuations impact membrane potential, cortical state, and sensory encoding, yet prior studies report inconsistent effects, likely due to averaging across heterogeneous cell types. To resolve this, we combined two-photon calcium imaging and pupillometry in awake mice to examine arousal-related activity in excitatory subpopulations of the auditory cortex: intratelencephalic (IT), extratelencephalic (ET), and corticothalamic (CT) neurons. Pupil-linked arousal modulated all cell types through diverse linear and non-linear response motifs. ET neurons showed significant multiplicative and additive gain modulation, with enhanced response magnitude and encoding but reduced frequency selectivity. CT and L2/3 neurons exhibited inverted-U relationships between arousal and both response strength and decoding accuracy, while IT neurons were minimally affected. These patterns closely tracked changes in population-level reliability, revealing a mechanistic link between internal state and the stability of sensory representations.

">Lateral hypothalamus directs stress-induced modulation of acute and psoriatic itch</a></h4>

              
                Stress and anxiety are well-known modulators of both physiological and pathological itch. Acute stress suppresses itch, while chronic stress exacerbates it. These effects are mediated by neural circuits within the brain, though the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of neurons in the stress-sensitive lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) in modulating itch. Using neural activity-dependent genetic labeling and chemogenetic tools, we selectively engaged a population of LHA neurons (LHAstress-TRAP neurons) responsive to stress. Transient stimulation of these neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors, conditioned place aversion, and suppressed acute (chloroquine-induced) and chronic (psoriatic) itch. Conversely, the inhibition of the LHAstress-TRAP neurons enhanced acute and chronic itch. Interestingly, LHAstress-TRAP neurons did not respond to acute itch stimuli, but their activity was temporally correlated with scratching episodes in mice with psoriasis. Ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that these neurons exhibit heightened excitability in psoriatic animals. Anterograde viral tracing demonstrated that LHAstress-TRAP neurons project to brainstem regions implicated in itch modulation, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and optogenetic silencing of LHAstress-TRAP axon terminals revealed that bidirectional modulation of itch is primarily mediated through projections to the PAG. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized central mechanism by which stress modulates itch, centered on a specific population of LHA neurons and their downstream brainstem targets.

">AAV gene therapy for Cockayne syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive, progressive developmental and neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 30% of cases are caused by mutations in the ERCC8/CSA gene. Patients with CS present with cutaneous photosensitivity, growth failure, shorter life span and a progressive degeneration of the central nervous system. Loss of function mutations in CSA result in deficiencies in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, regulation of RNA Pol II mediated transcription repair of oxidative DNA damage, and mitochondrial metabolism. Currently there are no available therapies for these patients. AAV gene therapy offers an opportunity to address this unmet need. We designed a new AAV vector encoding human CSA under a CBA promoter. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of this AAV9-CSA vector by neonatal ICV injection in the Csa-/-;Xpa-/- mouse model. Treatment with AAV9-CSA resulted in a significant increase in lifespan, and broad distribution of human CSA in the brain and heart. Despite clear therapeutic benefit, we also observed neuroradiological abnormalities, neuropathologic alterations including hypo-myelination, astrocytosis, microgliosis, and likely life limiting transcriptomic alterations in liver at endpoint. Nonetheless, the success of these experiments paves the way for the first in human clinical translation of a gene therapy for CS patients.

">Effects of diffusion MRI spatial resolution on human brain short-range association fiber reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation</a></h4>

              
                Short-range association fibers (SAFs) are critical for cortical communications but are often underestimated in conventional resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) since they locate within a ~1.5mm thin layer of superficial white matter. With the emergence of sub-millimeter diffusion imaging techniques, this study timely evaluated the effects of image spatial resolution on SAF reconstruction using simulation data and multi-resolution (2, 1.5, and 0.96 mm iso.) empirical data acquired on the same 20 healthy subjects using the gSlider sequence and 20 widely used tractography approaches. Resolution effects were qualitatively assessed through model fitting and tractography results and quantitatively evaluated using global and regional short-range connectivity strength (SCS). It is found that lower resolution systematically reduced SCS across all methods in a spatially varying way. Moreover, tractography methods exhibited significant differences in resolution sensitivity, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based single-tissue single-fiber tractography showing greater vulnerability than constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based multi-tissue multi-fiber tractography, and probabilistic tracking with anatomical constraints (ACT) and filtering (SIFT) improved robustness. Finally, up-sampling data to nominally higher resolution partially mitigated resolution-induced degradation and improved SAF reconstruction accuracy, particularly for DTI tractography. Based on these findings, higher resolution and multi-shell imaging is recommended if possible. For a given dataset, data up-sampling and DTI-based probabilistic tracking with ACT is recommended for single-shell low b-value data. CSD-based probabilistic tracking with ACT and SIFT is recommended for single-shell higher b-value data and multi-shell data. In summary, this study systematically and quantitatively evaluated resolution effects on SAF reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation and provides practical guidelines for more accurate mapping of SAFs that will improve the characterization of healthy and diseased human brains in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications.

">Accumulation of LRRK2-associated phospho-Rab12 degenerative lysosomes in tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenic mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with endolysosomal dysfunction across cell types, and carriers of LRRK2 mutations variably present with phosphorylated tau and -synuclein deposits in post-mortem analysis. LRRK2 mutations increase the phosphorylation of Rab substrates including Rab12. Rab12 is expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells with localization to membranes in the endolysosomal compartment. Under lysosomal stress, LRRK2 interaction with Rab12 upregulates LRRK2 kinase activity. In this study, using a recently developed monoclonal antibody directed to the LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation site on Rab12 at amino acid Ser106 (pS106-Rab12), we test whether aberrant LRRK2 phosphorylation is associated with tau and/or -synuclein pathology across clinically distinct neurodegenerative diseases. Analysis of brain tissue lysates and immunohistochemistry of pathology-susceptible brain regions demonstrate that pS106-Rab12 levels are increased in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In early pathological stages, phosphorylated Rab12 localizes to granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs), which are thought to be active lysosomal-like structures, in neurons. pS106-Rab12-positive GVBs accumulate with pathological tau stage across brain tissues in DLB, AD, and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In a mouse model of tauopathy, pS106-Rab12 localizes to GVBs during early tau deposition in an age-dependent manner. While GVBs are largely absent in neurons with mature protein pathology, subsets of both tau and -synuclein inclusions appear to incorporate pS106-Rab12 at later pathological stages. Finally, pS106-Rab12 labels GVBs in neurons and shows widespread co-pathology with tau inclusions in primary tauopathies including Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. These results implicate LRRK2 kinase activity and Rab phosphorylation in endolysosomal dysfunction in both tau and -synuclein-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

">Smelling the Risk: Early Olfactory Deficits, Brain Networks, and Blood Markers of Alzheimers Disease Risk in Humanized APOE Mice</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory impairment is a hallmark of early Alzheimers disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms connecting sensory decline to genetic and environmental risk factors remain unclear. Our integrative analysis combines ethologically relevant olfactory behavior assays, high-resolution diffusion MRI connectomics, and blood transcriptomics in a large cohort of humanized APOE mice stratified by APOE genotype (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4), age, sex, high-fat diet, and immune background (HN). Behaviorally, APOE4 mice exhibited accelerated deficits in odor salience, novelty detection, and memory, especially when exposed to a high-fat diet, whereas APOE2 mice showed resilience (ANOVA: APOE x HN, F(2,1669)=77.25, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.08). Notably, age and diet exerted compounding effects, with older and HFD-fed mice displaying reduced odor-guided exploration (diet x age: F(1,1669)=16.04, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.01). Memory analyses revealed robust genotype- and age-dependent impairments: at 24- and 48-hour delays, recognition indices were significantly lower in APOE4 mice compared to APOE2 (long-term memory: APOE x HN, F(2,395)=5.6, p=0.004). Elastic Net-regularized multi-set canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) linked behavior to brain network substrates, revealing subnetworks whose connectivity explained up to 24 percent of behavioral variance (sum of canonical correlations: 1.27, 95% CI [1.18, 1.85], p<0.0001). High-weighted connections between the ventral orbital cortex, somatosensory cortex, and cerebellar-brainstem pathways were identified as critical nodes for risk or compensation. Integrative blood transcriptomics revealed eigengene modules strongly correlated with imaging changes in olfactory-memory circuits (for example, eigengene 2 vs. subiculum diffusivity: r = -0.5, p < 1e-30, explaining up to 24 percent of variance). Gene ontology analysis pinpointed shared pathways in synaptic signaling, translation, and metabolic regulation across brain and blood. Notably, glutamatergic and synaptic pathways were enriched among genes linking peripheral and central compartments. Collectively, these results demonstrate that olfactory behavior, quantitatively shaped by genotype, age, diet, and immune status, serves as a sensitive and translatable early biomarker of Alzheimers disease risk. Our systems-level approach identifies specific brain networks and peripheral molecular signatures underlying sensory-cognitive vulnerability, providing a robust framework for early detection and targeted intervention in AD.

">TURBO: Automated Total-body PET Image Processing and Kinetic Modeling Toolbox</a></h4>

              
                ABSTRACT Total-body PET imaging is a novel concept that requires a high level of automatization and standardization, as the large number of target tissues increases manual workload significantly. We introduce an automated analysis pipeline (TURBO) for preprocessing and kinetic modeling of total-body [15O]H2O and [18F]FDG PET data, enabling efficient and reproducible analysis of tissue perfusion and metabolism at regional and voxel level. The approach employs automated CT segmentation for ROI delineation, image-derived input determination, and region-specific PET data kinetic modelling. Methods: We validated the analysis pipeline using Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers) total-body PET/CT scans from 21 subjects scanned with [15O]H2O and 16 subjects scanned with [18F]FDG using six ROIs (cortical brain gray matter, left iliopsoas, right kidney, pancreas, spleen and liver) representing different levels of blood flow and glucose metabolism. Results: Model fits showed good quality with consistent parameter estimates at both regional and voxel levels (R^2 > 0.91 for [15O]H2O, R^2 > 0.99 for [18F]FDG). Estimates from manual and automated input functions were correlated (R^2 > 0.86 for [15O]H2O, and R^2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) with minimal bias (<10% for [15O]H2O and <2% for [18F]FDG). Manually and automatically (CT-based) extracted ROI level data showed strong agreement (R^2 > 0.82 for [15O]H2O and R^2 > 0.83 for [18F]FDG), while motion correction had little impact on parameter estimates (R^2 > 0.83 for [15O]H2O and R^2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) compared with uncorrected data. Conclusion: Our automated analysis pipeline provides reliable and reproducible parameter estimates across different regions, with average processing time of <180 min per subject. This pipeline completely automatizes total-body PET analysis, reducing manual effort and enabling reproducible studies of inter-organ blood flow and metabolism, including brain-body interactions.

">Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury causes neuronal damage in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease without an enduring impact on amyloid pathology, sleep, or epileptiform activity</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. Sleep disturbances and epileptiform abnormalities can appear after TBI and may contribute to the development of neuropathology. In this study, we characterized sleep, epileptiform activity, and neuropathology after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We used the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to deliver rmTBI or sham (control) treatment to 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice (n=19). One month post-injury, we implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes, recorded for 72 hours, and then collected brain tissue and blood plasma. Our assessment of sleep architecture showed that time spent in vigilance state was not affected by the rmTBI one month post-injury; however, power spectra analysis showed a statistically significant shift towards higher frequencies in the rmTBI group during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Epileptiform activity did not differ between sham and rmTBI. Compared to sham controls, the rmTBI group showed higher neurofilament light (NF-L), but not glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in blood plasma and no change in amyloid pathology. These results indicate sustained neurological injury in the APP/PS1 mice one month after rmTBI without affecting amyloid deposition in the brain. Our study suggests that rmTBI can induce neural injury without causing enduring sleep disruption, seizures, and exacerbation of amyloidosis in the APP/PS1 mouse model.

">Integrated Profiling of Synaptic E/I Balance Reveals Altered Synaptic Organization and Phenotypic Variability in a Prenatal ASD Model</a></h4>

              
                Proper regulation of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) is essential for maintaining stable neural circuit function and flexible behavior. Disruptions of E/I balance have been implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, despite advances in connectomics and molecular neuroscience, how localized disruptions in E/I balance within cortical laminar architectures contribute to behavioral abnormalities remains to be elucidated. Here, we developed a standardized analysis pipeline that combines depth-aligned synaptic mapping, perspective and logarithmic transformations, and multivariate behavioral profiling. Applying this approach to a prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure model of ASD, we identified depth-specific disruptions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), alongside impairments in social behavior. Principal component analysis (PCA) integrating synaptic and behavioral parameters revealed convergent abnormalities that robustly distinguished VPA-exposed mice from wild-type (WT) controls. Furthermore, although still at an exploratory stage, our findings demonstrate that the robustness of this pipeline enables both the identification of resilient individuals and the quantification of intervention effects. Together, our findings establish a new cross-level analytical framework linking synaptic organization to organismal behavior and provide insights into circuit-level mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes.

">Structural insights into wiring specificity in the neuromuscular system through the Beat-Side complex</a></h4>

              
                Nervous system assembly is guided by the actions of cell surface receptors. In Drosophila, members of the Beaten Path (Beat) and Sidestep (Side) protein families have been described as axon guidance receptor-cue pairs, in addition to roles in specifying synaptic connectivity in the optic lobe. To understand the molecular basis and specificity of Beat-Side interactions, we report here the first Beat-Side structure, Beat-Vc bound to Side-VI. The structure showed a binding topology similar to other neuronal immunoglobulin superfamily receptors, especially Nectins, SynCAMs, Dprs and DIPs, despite lack of established evolutionary relationships. Using a structure-based rational approach, we engineered and validated point mutations to break the binding between Beats and Sides. Using these mutant variants, we demonstrated in developing Drosophila larvae that the interaction between Beat-Ia and Side is required for establishing proper connectivity of motor neurons with muscles.

">Metformin boosts mitochondria and neurogenesis via AMPK/mTOR/SIRT3 in POLG mutant organoids</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mutations in the POLG gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, are the most common cause of mitochondrial diseases affecting the central nervous system. These mutations frequently result in neurodevelopmental disorders, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying POLG related encephalopathies remain poorly understood. In particular, how POLG mutations affect mitochondrial function, neural progenitor behavior, and early neurogenesis in the developing human brain has not been fully elucidated. Methods: To investigate the impact of POLG mutations on human neurodevelopment, we generated 3D cortical brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient carrying compound heterozygous POLG mutations (A467T/W748S). Organoid development was monitored using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and live-cell mitochondrial assays. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to profile cellular diversity and transcriptional changes. Organoids were treated with metformin, a known mitochondrial modulator, and mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring membrane potential (TMRE), ATP production, and mtDNA copy number. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate AMPK/SIRT3/mTOR signaling and markers of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests or ANOVA, with p-values < 0.05 considered significant. Results: POLG mutant cortical organoids exhibited impaired neural differentiation, with expansion of stress-associated neural progenitors and reduced neuronal populations. scRNA seq analysis revealed transcriptional signatures of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and suppressed neurogenesis, particularly in a specific neural progenitor subpopulation. Metformin treatment significantly improved mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP output, and mtDNA copy number in POLG organoids. It also promoted neuronal differentiation and reduced reactive progenitor states. Mechanistically, metformin activated AMPK and SIRT3, inhibited mTOR, enhanced expression of mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis markers (OPA1, PGC-1), and increased autophagic and mitophagic activity (LC3B, BNIP3). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that POLG mutations disrupt early cortical development by impairing mitochondrial function and skewing progenitor fate. Metformin mitigates these effects by restoring mitochondrial homeostasis and promoting neurogenesis through the AMPK/SIRT3/mTOR axis. These findings offer mechanistic insights into POLG-related encephalopathy and support metformin as a candidate for therapeutic intervention in mitochondrial neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Multivariate Resting-State Functional Connectivity Features Linked to Transdiagnostic Psychopathology in Early Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early psychosis (EP) is characterized by neurobiological changes, including alterations in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). We now understand that symptoms and neural changes may overlap across EP diagnostic categories. However, the relationship between RSFC patterns and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions remains poorly understood. Methods: We employed Partial Least Squares correlation to examine multivariate relationships between whole-brain RSFC and clinical symptoms in 124 EP patients (aged 16-35 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a psychotic mood disorder. RSFC was computed among 216 cortical and subcortical regions. Clinical assessment included 41 symptom measures spanning positive, negative, general psychopathology, and manic dimensions. Results: Analysis revealed one significant latent component (p<0.001) capturing 41.6% of the RSFC-symptom covariance. This component was characterized by increased between-network connectivity, particularly involving sensory-motor, default mode, and subcortical regions including the amygdala and thalamus. The associated symptom profile included cognitive rigidity and arousal dysregulation (stereotyped thinking, anxiety, and somatic concerns), rather than traditional positive or negative symptoms. This brain-behavior relationship was consistent across diagnoses and independent of medication and substance use. The clinical relevance was validated through significant correlations with standardized measures of hostility (r=0.23), negative affect (r=0.25), and perceived stress (r=0.22). Conclusions: Our findings reveal a distinct transdiagnostic phenotype in EP characterized by cognitive inflexibility and arousal dysregulation that is associated with altered integration between sensory, default mode, and subcortical networks. This work suggests that specific patterns of network-level functional connectivity may relate to symptom dimensions that cut across conventional diagnostic boundaries, potentially informing more targeted therapeutic approaches.

">Childhood Maltreatment and Deviations from Normative Brain Structure: Results from 3,711 Individuals from the ENIGMA MDD and ENIGMA PTSD</a></h4>

              
                Childhood maltreatment (CM), encompassing abuse and neglect, affects over two-thirds of the general population and increases risk for stress-related psychopathology, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The extent to which neuroanatomical alterations in MDD and PTSD are attributable to CM, however, is uncertain. Here, we analyzed CM and 3D structural brain MRI data from 3,711 participants in the ENIGMA MDD and PTSD Working Groups (25 sites; 33.3+/-13.0 years; 59.9% female). Normative modeling estimated deviation z-scores for 14 subcortical volumes (SV), 68 cortical thickness (CT), and 68 surface area (SA) measures, capturing differences from population norms. Transdiagnostic associations between CM and brain deviation scores were evaluated within each sex and age cohort. In young adults (ages 18-35), abuse was associated with larger volumes in thalamus and pallidum, thinner isthmus cingulate and middle frontal regions, and thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex; there were no significant effects in pediatric ([&le;]18 years) participants. The strongest effects were observed in young female adults (|{beta}|=.07-.22, q<.05): greater abuse and neglect were correlated with smaller hippocampus and putamen volumes, thinner entorhinal cortex, and smaller SA in fusiform/inferior parietal regions, and with larger SA in orbitofrontal and occipital cortices. In males, abuse had widespread effects on CT and SA (|{beta}|=.1-.18, q<.05); effects for neglect were minimal. Our findings of age- and sex-specific instantiations of CM on brain morphometry highlight the importance of developmental context in understanding how adverse experiences shape neurobiological vulnerability to MDD and PTSD.

">Neurological effects induced by micro- and nanoplastics in fish: a systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Plastic is considered an inert material with high durability and minimal to virtually no decomposition. However, when released into the environment, they can degrade into very small particles, forming micro- and nanoplastic particles (MNP). This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the evidence from controlled preclinical studies to investigate the neurological effects of MNPs in fish. Following a pre-registered protocol, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies exposing fish to virgin MNPs under controlled conditions, reporting behavioral or neurochemical outcomes relevant to central nervous system function. Data were synthesized using a hierarchical random-effects model with robust variance estimation. Fifty-nine studies, comprising 723 comparisons across 13 behavioral and neurochemical outcomes, were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis accounted for correlated effect sizes within shared control groups; and nested identifiers for study, control group, and effect size. Results indicated high heterogeneity and no consistent effect of the MNP exposure on behavioral or neurochemical parameters, except for reduced traveled distance in sensory-motor assays. Meta-regression examined whether developmental stage, exposure duration, and MNP size or concentration moderate these effects. No significant moderators were identified, except for catalase activity, where longer exposure reduced enzyme activity in larvae. The findings should be interpreted with caution, as reporting quality was generally low, with key methodological details often omitted. Additionally, publication bias was found for several outcomes, and influential case analyses revealed that a few studies disproportionately affected the overall estimates. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of MNPs on fish neurobiology and behavior.

">Development of a Novel Benzodiazepine to Delineate Peripheral GABA-A Signaling Mechanisms in Visceral Pain Syndromes</a></h4>

              
                Background and Aims. Visceral pain is a cardinal symptom of many disorders affecting the gut. Modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) such as benzodiazepines may attenuate colonic pain but the specific contribution of peripheral GABAA receptors remains unclear as these agents have prominent central effects. Methods. Using medicinal chemistry optimization of the benzodiazepine scaffold, we developed a novel and potent benzodiazepine-based positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABAA receptors, Li633, with no significant central nervous system (CNS) penetration. Results. The locomotor activity of rats placed in an open field was unchanged with Li633 at doses up to 30 mg/kg, confirming its lack of a CNS effect. LI-633 produced robust potentiation of GABA-induced inward current, with EC50 values ranging from 8 nM (5{beta}2{gamma}2) to 128 nM (3{beta}2{gamma}2). In vitro electrophysiological studies confirmed its ability to reduce excitability of human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. LI-633 potentiated muscimol-induced GABAergic currents in rat DRG neurons in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 70.4 nM. In vivo, LI-633 significantly attenuated visceral hypersensitivity and pain behavior in a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). In the IBS model, administration of the drug also resulted in decreased excitability of colon-specific DRG neurons and significantly reduced the colonic afferent response to balloon distention as measured by recordings of neural activity in dorsal ganglia rootlets. Conclusions. These findings highlight the potential of targeting peripheral GABAA receptors for pain management in IBS and other disorders associated with visceral hypersensitivity.

">Ambient Pollution Components and Sources Associated with Hippocampal Architecture and Memory in Pre-Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ambient air pollution poses significant risks to brain health. Hippocampal structure and function are particularly vulnerable, yet the extent to which they are associated with air pollution in children remains unclear. We therefore conducted multi-pollutant mixture analyses to examine how air pollution influences hippocampal architecture and memory performance in late childhood. Methods: We used partial least squares correlation to explore cross-sectional associations between fifteen PM2.5 components, six PM2.5 source factors, NO2, and ozone exposures, and measures of hippocampal microstructure and volume in children aged 9-11 years (n = 7,940) We adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and neuroimaging confounds. We also tested whether air pollutants were associated with hippocampal-dependent list-learning memory performance to examine functional implications of air pollution exposure. Shared variance refers to the proportion of total covariance between variable sets captured by each latent dimension in the multivariate relationship. Findings: In the first latent dimension, greater exposure to organic carbon and ozone was associated with differential hippocampal diffusion (72% of shared variance), whereas the second latent dimension linked elemental carbon and iron to hippocampal diffusion (24% of shared variance). Source-based analyses identified biomass burning and traffic pollution as key contributors (61% and 32% variance, respectively). Volumetric analyses revealed higher copper and zinc exposure correlated with smaller hippocampal subregion volumes (left head, right body, tail; 77% variance), whereas lower nickel levels correlated with smaller right head volume (12% variance). Higher industrial and traffic pollutants were also associated with smaller hippocampal volumes (75% variance). We found two latent dimensions (67% and 23% variance, respectively) showing poorer learning, immediate recall, and mnemonic interference performance linked to higher calcium, elemental carbon, and zinc, and organic carbon, alongside lower copper exposure. Finally, hippocampal diffusion (higher free water/lower hindered extracellular diffusion; 83% variance) and smaller tail volumes (96% variance) were linked to poorer RAVLT recall. Interpretation: These results underscore the complex relationship between air pollution exposure and hippocampal architecture and cautions that such structural changes may either presage or reflect subtle differences in neurocomputational mechanisms associated with learning and memory performance in children.

">Opposing responses of hippocampal theta oscillations to running and a forelimb-dominated sensorimotor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal theta oscillations regulate the timing of neurons to support navigation, memory formation, and sensorimotor integration. Theta is modulated by running speed, breathing, whisking, and jumping and increases in tasks involving memory encoding or retrieval. The positive relationship between theta frequency and running speed is believed stabilize hippocampal representations of space amid movement variability. Here, we incorporated a novel string-pulling task to determine if established relationships between movement and theta hold when progress to a reward is determined by the length of string pulled. This task eliminates many speed-associated inputs, such vestibular, visual, and hindlimb information, and allows an unprecedented level of precision in the analysis of individual paw movements. Given that animals move the string a fixed length to acquire a reward, we predicted that the positive relationship between theta frequency and speed would hold. Approach: Five Sprague Dawley rats (4 mo.) were trained to continuously pull a string a fixed distance of 208 cm using an automated string-pulling system and run on a track for food reward. Local-field data was acquired from electrodes in dorsal CA1. Results: Relationships between theta and movement speed were distinct during string pulling and running. While theta was robust in both conditions, frequency was significantly reduced during string-pulling and showed no speed-frequency coupling, unlike running. This difference could result from the conflict between hindlimb and forelimb signals, with only forelimb movement signaling advancement. Fine-grained analysis of paw movements during string-pulling (lift, advance, grasp, pull, push) revealed that theta power and frequency peaked during the contralateral paw downward push despite paw speed being low during this action. This suggests that theta frequency and power could respond to effort rather than purely kinematic information. Notably, running-associated theta may similarly reflect both speed and effort as most locomotor tasks conflate these variables. Finally, theta phase aligned from one reach-pull cycle to the next during the downward pull motion - the first action that directly advances the string forward. Since phase-locking has been associated with sensorimotor gating, synchrony at this point could reflect the gating of inputs that are the most causally relevant for reaching the reward, potentially facilitating integration of action-outcome signals for memory encoding and navigation. Taken together, these data support a dual-scale view of hippocampal processing and theta-band activity where macroscale theta activity requires suprathreshold sensory, vestibular, and proprioceptive drive and microscale theta remains sensitive to subsecond limb movements.

">Error encoding in human speech motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans monitor their actions, including detecting errors during speech production. This self-monitoring capability also enables speech neuroprosthesis users to recognize mistakes in decoded output upon receiving visual or auditory feedback. However, it remains unknown whether neural activity related to error detection is present in the speech motor cortex. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of neural error signals in speech motor cortex firing rates during intracortical brain-to-text speech neuroprosthesis use. This activity could be decoded to enable the neuroprosthesis to identify its own errors with up to 86% accuracy. Additionally, we observed distinct neural patterns associated with specific types of mistakes, such as phonemic or semantic differences between the person's intended and displayed words. These findings reveal how feedback errors are represented within the speech motor cortex, and suggest strategies for leveraging these additional cognitive signals to improve neuroprostheses.

">A Radiomic Approach to Clinical MRI Refines the Thalamus-Cognition Link in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Radiomics extracts imaging features that may not be detectable through conventional volumetric analyses. Given their role in multiple sclerosis (MS), we applied radiomics to thalamic nuclei and examined their associations with cognitive performance. Methods: A total of 601 individuals were included (342 people with MS-PwMS from two cohorts, and 259 healthy controls-HC). Radiomic features (RF) and volumes were extracted from the whole thalamus, five thalamic nuclei, and the putamen segmented on 3D T1-weighted images. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in PwMS, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) in HC. In the first MS cohort, multivariate linear regression in a discovery set (N=103) identified thalamus-derived RF associated with SDMT, which were retested in a replication set (N=63). Their associations with PASAT in a second MS cohort (N=176) and DSST in HC were also evaluated. We then tested whether the same RF, when extracted from the putamen, were associated with SDMT. LASSO models assessed the combined predictive value of RF and volumes. Results: Twenty-eight RF_ROI pairs were associated with SDMT in the replication set (FDR<0.05). Of these, 24 were also associated with PASAT (FDR[&le;]0.03), and 2 with DSST Only ventral nuclei volume showed replicated associations among volumetrics. Only 4 putamen-derived pairs were associated with SDMT (FDR=0.04). LASSO results confirmed RF outperformed volumes. Discussion: RF extracted from the thalamus are strongly associated with cognitive performance in PwMS, outperforming volumetric measures and supporting their potential as sensitive imaging biomarkers.

">Whisker stimulation reinforces a resting-state network in the barrel cortex: nested oscillations and avalanches</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex operates in a state of restless activity, even in the absence of external stimuli. Collective neuronal activities, such as neural avalanches and synchronized oscillations, are also found under rest conditions, and these features have been suggested to support sensory processing, brain readiness for rapid responses, and computational efficiency. The rat barrel cortex and thalamus circuit, with its somatotopic organization for processing whisker movements, provides a powerful system to explore such interplay. To characterize these resting state circuits, we perform simultaneous multi-electrode recordings in rats' barrel cortex and thalamus. During spontaneous activity, oscillations with frequencies centered around 11.5 Hz are detected concomitantly with slow oscillations below 4 Hz, as well as power-law distributed avalanches. The phase of the lower-frequency oscillation appears to modulate the higher-frequency amplitude, and it has a role in gating avalanche occurrences. We then record neural activity during controlled whisker movements to confirm that the 11.5 Hz barrel circuit active at rest is indeed the one involved in response to whisker stimulation. We finally show how a thalamic-driven firing-rate model can describe the entire phenomenology observed at resting state and predict the response of the barrel cortex to controlled whisker movement.

">Differential microstructural development within sensorimotor cortical regions: A diffusion MRI study in preterm and full-term infants</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system develops early in utero and supports the emergence of body representations critical for perception, action, and interaction with environment. While somatotopic protomaps are already developed in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices in late pregnancy, little is known about the anatomical substrates of this functional specialization. In this study, we aimed to decipher the microstructural properties of these regions in the developing brain. Using advanced diffusion MRI and post-processing tools, we parcellated the pre- and post-central gyri into microstructurally distinct clusters along the lateral-to-medial axis in full-term neonates, confirming the early differentiation within sensorimotor regions. These clusters were further analyzed in preterm infants scanned near birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA), compared with another group of full-term neonates. Applying a multivariate Mahalanobis distance approach, we quantified deviations in preterm cortical microstructure relative to the full-term reference. Preterm infants showed significant region- and position-specific deviations at both ages, though these were smaller at TEA, consistently with ongoing maturation during the pre-term period. Differences between the pre- and post-central gyri, and along the somatotopic axis, suggested differential vulnerability to prematurity. In particular, the motor regions appeared to be at a more advanced stage of maturation close to birth and less vulnerable at TEA than somatosensory regions. An opposite trend was observed for lateral positions related to mouth representation compared with intermediary and medial positions. These findings support the notion that early sensorimotor cortical specialization is microstructurally emergent during gestation and sensitive to atypical developmental context of preterm birth.

">Ultrafast endocytosis in mouse cortical inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuitry depends on excitatory and inhibitory regulation of activity to yield functional outputs. However, examinations of synaptic vesicle recycling have focused heavily on excitatory synapses, leaving many questions unanswered for inhibitory synapse dynamics. Here we show that both excitatory and inhibitory cortical synapses contain depots of a protein essential for ultrafast endocytosis, Dynamin 1xA, at a region immediately next to the active zone where ultrafast endocytosis takes place. Using zap-and-freeze time-resolved electron microscopy in mouse acute cortical slices, we observe uncoated pits reminiscent of ultrafast endocytic intermediates appearing post-stimulus at putative inhibitory synapses. These findings suggest that excitatory and inhibitory synapses may perform similar modes of endocytosis.

">Circadian timing and entrainment properties of the SCN pacemaker in the PS19 mouse model of Tau pathology</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolded microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), leading to its abnormal accumulation and hyperphosphorylation, and resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. Tauopathy patients also experience disruptions to circadian rhythms of behavior and sleep. The connection between tau pathology and circadian dysfunction is not well understood, especially regarding the role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's central circadian pacemaker. Here, we conducted histological and functional analyses of the SCN in the PS19 (Prnp-huMAPT*P301S) mouse model of tauopathy. The SCN of PS19 mice had accumulation of phosphorylated tau as early as 2 months of age, and tau pathology was detected in both major neuronal subpopulations of the SCN: VIPergic (core) and AVPergic (shell) neurons. To assess SCN timing and entrainment properties, daily locomotor activity was monitored in PS19 and wild-type (WT) mice from 3 to 11 months-of-age. Activity profiles, rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light/dark cycle, and intrinsic circadian timing properties were unchanged in PS19 mice compared to age-matched WT mice. Finally, profiling circadian gene expression in tau fibril-seeded SCN explants from PS19 and WT mice did not detect differences in network-level oscillator properties. Together, these findings suggest that tau pathology within the SCN is not sufficient to trigger marked disruptions of core circadian timing mechanisms in this tauopathy model. Further, these results raise the possibility that circadian disruptions in tauopathies arise from dysfunction in SCN-gated output pathways or downstream clock-gated circuits rather than the SCN oscillator itself.

The combination of frequency-specific coherence and information flow dynamics from effective connectivity (EC) demonstrated that 160 Hz STN stimulation increases the high-γ power in RFA and CFA. Additionally, 160 Hz STN stimulation reduced the β- and high γ-frequency coherence between RFA, CFA, and STN, as well as the EC from STN towards RFA and CFA, but no change in the connectivity from cortex towards STN was attested, demonstrating hyperdirect pathway activation. Our work provides empirical insights into the mechanisms of action of DBS, which represent an important basis for the further development of this therapy.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Evidence for sex differences in cognition in childhood is established, but less is known about the underlying neural mechanisms for these differences. Recent findings suggest the existence of brain–behavior relationship heterogeneities during infancy; however, it remains unclear whether sex underlies these heterogeneities during this critical period when sex-related behavioral differences arise. A sample of 316 infants was included with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at neonate (3 weeks), 1 year and 2 years of age. We used multiple linear regression to test interactions between sex and resting-state functional connectivity on behavioral scores of working memory, inhibitory self-control, intelligence, and anxiety collected at 4 years of age. We found 6 age-specific, intra-hemispheric connections showing significant and robust sex differences in functional connectivity–behavior relationships. All connections are either with the prefrontal cortex or in regions with direct anatomical pathways to the prefrontal cortex. These sex differences in functional connectivity only emerge when associated with behavior and not in functional connectivity independently. Taken together, we capture robust and conserved brain mechanisms that are distinct to sex and are defined by their relationship to behavioral outcomes. Our results establish brain–behavior mechanisms as an important feature in the search for sex differences during development.</span>

Combining hierarchical spatial gradient and partial least squares regression analysis methods, we investigated the cortical abnormalities of functional gradient in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its relationships with genic transcriptomic information. Additionally, we described the hierarchical function system development during childhood using developmental curve fitting analysis. We observed increased functional gradients in the regions within visual and dorsal attention networks, and decreased gradients distributing in the regions with limbic and default mode networks. Compared with the typical developmental age–gradient track curve, individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder exhibited earlier turning points and smaller curve’s variation ranges. Gene expression analysis showed a significantly overlapped enrichment pathways associated with nervous system development between the genes we identified and those previously reported. Above-abnormal functional gradients and network-level averaged gradient values exhibited significant correlations with clinical inattention scores in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

">Long-Range Input to Cortical Microcircuits Shapes EEG-BOLD Correlation</a></h4>

              
                Although generated by different mechanisms, electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity have been shown to be correlated. The level of correlation varies between EEG frequency bands, brain regions and experimental paradigms, but the underpinning mechanisms of this correlation remain poorly understood. Here we create a mathematical, data-informed model of a cortical microcircuit that encompasses all major neuron types across cortical layers, and use it to generate EEG and BOLD under various external input conditions. The model exhibits noise-driven fluctuations mimicking EEG rhythms, with external inputs modulating EEG spectral characteristics. Consistent with experimental results, we observe negative alpha-BOLD correlation and positive gamma-BOLD correlation across different input configurations. Temporal variability of the input is found to increase EEG-BOLD correlation and to improve the correspondence with experimental results. This study provides a mathematical framework to theoretically study the correlation of EEG and BOLD features in a comprehensive way.

">Modality-Agnostic Decoding of Vision and Language from fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Humans perform tasks involving the manipulation of inputs regardless of how these signals are perceived by the brain, thanks to representations that are agnostic to the stimulus modality. Investigating such modality-agnostic representations requires experimental datasets with multiple modalities of presentation. In this paper, we introduce and analyze SemReps-8K, a new large-scale fMRI dataset of 6 subjects watching both images and short text descriptions of such images, as well as conditions during which the subjects were imagining visual scenes. The multimodal nature of this dataset enables the development of modality-agnostic decoders, trained to predict which stimulus a subject is seeing, irrespective of the modality in which the stimulus is presented. Further, we performed a searchlight analysis revealing that large areas of the brain contain modality-agnostic representations. Such areas are also particularly suitable for decoding visual scenes from the mental imagery condition. The dataset will be made publicly available.

">Infection-Specific Reprogramming of Microglia Reveals Distinct Virulence Pathways Linking Periodontal Pathogens to Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Microglial dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet how pathogen-specific cues sculpt microglial diversity remains unclear. Here we integrate high-dimensional single-cell cytometry in vitro with spatial proteomics in vivo to dissect the impact of two major periodontal pathogens on microglia. Using a 36-marker CyTOF panel, we exposed SIM A9 microglia to wild-type Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) or Tannerella forsythia (Tf) and to gingipain-deficient or S-layer-deficient mutants, resolving 38 clusters. Virulence-factor "switches" redirected cells from homeostatic states toward i) oxidative, antigen-presenting programmes driven by Pg gingipains and ii) an immunosuppressive, exhausted-like state driven by the Tf S-layer. Complementary 37-marker imaging mass cytometry of 5xFAD x hTau knock-in mice chronically infected with Pg identified 21 microglial subclusters. The cortex - but not hippocampus - lost two Arg1+/IL-10+ immunoregulatory subsets (>2-fold decrease) while NADPH oxidase-high microglia accumulated around amyloid-{beta} and tau aggregates. These data demonstrate pathogen-specific reprogramming of microglia across model systems and brain regions, linking virulence factor activity to AD-relevant neuroinflammation. By pinpointing gingipains and the bacterial S-layer as molecular "switches", our study highlights tractable therapeutic targets for limiting infection-driven microglial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

">Nociceptin receptor and ligand in Alzheimer's disease:Implications for psychiatric symptoms and circadianregulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nociceptin (N/OFQ) and its receptor OPRL1 play crucial roles in emotional processing, reward-related behaviors, learning, and neurotransmitter regulation, but their involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains poorly understood. This study investigated possible relationships between prepronociceptin (PNOC) and OPRL1 expression and psychiatric symptoms in AD, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains. Methods: Post-mortem brain tissue from the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (BA32) was analyzed in 61 donors across different Braak and Braak (B&B) stages. RNA expression of PNOC and OPRL1 was quantified and correlated with RDoC scores derived from medical records using NLP. Sex-stratified analyses, circadian rhythmicity analysis, and cell-type specific expression patterns were examined. Results: Both genes showed significant downregulation in AD cases (PNOC: p = 0.024; OPRL1: p < 0.001), with notable sex differences. Men displayed higher post-mortem PNOC (Cohen's d = -0.482) and OPRL1 (Cohen's d = -0.237) expression compared to women. In adjusted models controlling for B&B stage and post-mortem interval, PNOC expression significantly correlated with dimensional scores of positive valence ({beta} = -0.38, p = 0.035) and arousal regulatory systems ({beta} = -0.43, p = 0.015) derived from a text classification algorithm applied to medical records. OPRL1 showed disrupted circadian rhythmicity in AD cases (p = 0.151 vs. p = 0.020 in controls). Conclusions: These findings suggest distinct roles for PNOC and OPRL1 in AD pathology, with PNOC primarily associated with psychiatric symptoms and OPRL1 showing disrupted circadian regulation. Sex-specific expression patterns further indicate the need for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the nociceptin system.

">Riding the savory horse: An active mindset and food macronutrient composition influence attentional bias toward food cues</a></h4>

              
                Food cues that appear in the visual field capture our attention easily and can influence eating behavior. The current study investigated the influence of food-related stimuli on visual attention, considering the macronutrient composition of food items. Images representing sweet and savory foods were employed, the latter consisting primarily of high-protein foods. The participants were primed with these images prior to performing the attentional task. We found that both sets of food images elicited an emotional attentional blink (EAB), but a stronger EAB was observed for the high-protein foods, and this observation was further supported by a negative correlation between the attentional bias (ABias) and the proportion of protein consumed by the participants before the experiment, with participants who consumed less protein exhibiting a stronger ABias toward high-protein foods. These findings suggest that an ABias might also arise to facilitate the consumption of high-protein foods when prior consumption of this macronutrient is low.

                <p>Understanding the ability to self-evaluate decisions is an active area of research. This research has primarily focused on the neural correlates of self-evaluation during visual tasks and whether neural correlates before or after the primary decision contribute to self-reported confidence. This focus has been useful, yet the reliance on subjective confidence reports may confound our understanding of key everyday features of metacognitive self-evaluation: that decisions must be rapidly evaluated without explicit feedback and unfold in a multisensory world. These considerations led us to hypothesize that an automatic domain-general metacognitive signal may be shared between sensory modalities, which we tested in the present study with multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (<I>N</I> = 21, 12 female) first performed a visual task with no request for self-evaluations of performance, prior to an auditory task that included rating decision confidence on each trial. A multivariate classifier trained to predict errors in the speeded visual task generalized to distinguish correct and error trials in the subsequent nonspeeded auditory discrimination. This generalization did not occur for classifiers trained on the visual stimulus-locked data and further predicted subjective confidence on the subsequent auditory task. This evidence of overlapping post-response neural activity provides evidence for automatic encoding of confidence independent of any explicit request for metacognitive reports and a shared basis for metacognitive evaluations across sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>Rod and cone photoreceptor cells selectively contact different compartments of axon-bearing retinal horizontal cells in the mammalian retina. Cones synapse exclusively on the soma whereas rods synapse exclusively on a large axon terminal compartment. The possibility that rod signals can travel down the axon from terminal to soma has been proposed as a means of producing spectrally opponent interactions between rods and cones, but there is conflicting data about whether this actually occurs. The spectral overlap between rods and cones in mouse makes it difficult to stimulate rod and cone pigments separately. We therefore used optogenetic techniques to analyze photoreceptor inputs into horizontal somas by selectively expressing channelrhodopsin in rods and/or cones. Optogenetic stimulation of rods and cones both evoked large fast inward currents in horizontal cell somas. Cone-driven responses were abolished by eliminating synaptic release in a cone-specific knock-out of the exocytotic calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, rod-driven responses in horizontal somas were unchanged after eliminating synaptic release from rods but abolished by eliminating release from both rods and cones. This suggests that release from cones is required for transmission of rod signals to horizontal cell somas. Rods and cones are coupled by Cx36 gap junctions, and we found that selective elimination of Cx36 from rods also abolished rod-driven optogenetic responses in horizontal cell somas. Together, these results show that rod signals reach the somas of B-type horizontal cells exclusively via gap junctions with cones and not by transmission down the axon from the axon terminal.</p>

                <p>Perceptual localization of brief, high-contrast perisaccadic visual probes is grossly erroneous. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans, more needs to be learned about its underlying neural mechanisms. This ideally requires running similar behavioral paradigms in animals. However, during neurophysiology, neurons encountered in the relevant sensory and sensory&ndash;motor brain areas for visual mislocalization can have arbitrary, noncardinal response field locations. This necessitates using mislocalization paradigms that can work with any saccade direction. Here, we first established such a paradigm in three male rhesus macaque monkeys. In every trial, the monkeys generated a saccade toward an eccentric target. Once a saccade onset was detected, we presented a brief flash at one of three possible locations ahead of the saccade target location. After an experimentally imposed delay, we removed the saccade target, and the monkeys were then required to generate a memory-guided saccade toward the remembered flash location. All three monkeys readily learned the task, and, like humans, they all showed strong backward mislocalization toward the saccade target, which recovered for later flashes from the saccade time. Importantly, we then replicated a known property of human perisaccadic mislocalization, as revealed by two-dimensional mislocalization paradigms: that mislocalization is the strongest for upward saccades. For horizontal saccades, we additionally found stronger mislocalization for upper visual field flashes, again consistent with humans. Our results establish a robust two-dimensional mislocalization paradigm in monkeys, and they pave the way for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dependence of perisaccadic mislocalization strength on saccade direction.</p>

                <p>by Wiep Stikvoort, Eider Pérez-Ordoyo, Iván Mindlin, Anira Escrichs, Jacobo D. Sitt, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Yonatan Sanz Perl</p>

Assessing someone’s level of consciousness is a complex matter, and attempts have been made to aid clinicians in these assessments through metrics based on neuroimaging data. Many studies have empirically investigated measures related to the complexity elicited after the brain is stimulated to quantify the level of consciousness across different states. Here we hypothesized that the level of non-equilibrium dynamics of the unperturbed brain already contains the information needed to know how the system will react to an external stimulus. We created personalized whole-brain models fitted to resting state fMRI data recorded in participants in altered states of consciousness (e.g., deep sleep, disorders of consciousness) to infer the effective connections underlying their brain dynamics. We then measured the out-of-equilibrium nature of the unperturbed brain by evaluating the level of asymmetry of the inferred connectivity, the time irreversibility in each model and compared this with the elicited complexity generated after <i>in silico</i> perturbations, using a simulated fMRI-based version of the Perturbational Complexity Index, a measure that has been shown to distinguish different levels of consciousness in <i>in vivo</i> settings. Crucially, we found that states of consciousness involving lower arousal and/or lower awareness had a lower level of asymmetry in their effective connectivities, a lower level of irreversibility in their simulated dynamics, and a lower complexity compared to control subjects. We show that the asymmetry in the underlying connections drives the nonequilibrium state of the system and in turn the differences in complexity as a response to the external stimuli.

                <p>by Kevin J. Flynn, Andrew Yu. Morozov</p>

Many organisms, notably phototrophs, routinely acquire resources over only a fraction of the day. They have to balance their main period of initial biosynthesis against cell cycle events. Because of their short generation times, this challenge is especially acute for the planktonic microalgae that perform 50% of global C-fixation. Empirical evidence indicates that microalgal day-average growth is a function of the ability to acquire resources rapidly when available, retaining initial products of assimilation to support growth. A fundamental question arises over the optimal physiological configuration to support such activity. Here, we applied computer simulations implementing a development of the quota concept, in which the internal limiting resource is itself C, ratioed against total organism C-biomass. The model comprises metabolite and core pools of carbon C (<sup>M</sup><i>C</i> and <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>, respectively), with growth modulated by <sup>M</sup><i>C</i>/(<sup>M</sup><i>C</i><sup> </sup>+ <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>); <sup>M</sup><i>C</i> supports growth of <sup>C</sup><i>C</i> in the absence of concurrent resource acquisition. Dynamic feedback interactions from the relative size of <sup>M</sup>C controls resource acquisition. The model reproduces the general pattern of growth at different light:day fraction (<i>LD</i>), and of afternoon-depression of C-fixation. We explored the efficiency of the physiological cell configuration to locate optimal configurations at different combinations of maximum growth rates (<i>U</i><sub>max</sub>) and <i>LD</i> values across plausible parameter values for microalgae. While the optimum maximum resource acquisition rate deployed during the L phase scales with <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>LD</i>, the maximum size of the metabolite pool scales to <i>LD</i>/<i>DV</i>, where <i>DV</i> is division time (i.e. <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/Ln(2)). Accordingly, we conclude that faster growing organisms carry a penalty limiting their geographic spread to latitudes and seasons where <i>LD</i> is high. Larger, vacuolated organisms (such as diatoms), having a bigger metabolite compartment, may be at an advantage in such situations.

                <p>by Swathi Anil, Dan F. M. Goodman, Marcus Ghosh</p>

Animals continuously combine information across sensory modalities and time, and use these combined signals to guide their behaviour. Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence of pediatric “mild” traumatic brain injury (pmTBI), very little is known about the long-term effects of injury on brain structure and how injuries manifest in the context of dynamic and regionally specific neurodevelopmental changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective study design characterizing long-term effects of pmTBI on both global (brain age) and regional (hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, and cortical thickness) brain structure at approximately 7 days, 4 months, and 1-year post-injury. A large sample of age- and sex-matched healthy controls was imaged at identical temporal intervals to account for typical neurodevelopmental changes, and to assess how trauma potentially affects developmental trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 269 pmTBI (age = 14.4 ± 2.9; 41.6% female) and 232 healthy controls (age = 14.1 ± 2.9; 44.8% female) were included in the final analyses (&gt;70% 1-year retention). Results demonstrated that the presence of loss of consciousness and/or post-traumatic amnesia was associated with increased brain age up to 1-year post-injury, increased frontal cortical thickness at 4 months, as well as hippocampal atrophy across all time points relative to controls. “Mild” head trauma also interfered with hippocampal neurodevelopment in a dose-dependent fashion, including within the CA1 subfield. In contrast, post-concussive symptom burden was not associated with any structural abnormalities or alterations to neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Current findings suggest a dose-dependent relationship between injury severity and alterations in both global and regional brain structure within the spectrum of pmTBI. Our results emphasize the importance of using objective biomarkers rather than subjective self-reported symptoms to better understand the long-term effects of injury.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy filters and 2-fuzzy filters of a quasi-ordered residuated system K . This research explores comparative, normal, implicative and associative fuzzy filters within a quasi-ordered residuated system. It establishes the sufficient conditions under which a comparative fuzzy filter in K qualifies as a normal fuzzy filter and vice-versa. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the collection of all comparative fuzzy filters in K constitutes a complete lattice. The notion of fuzzy filters of a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated system is introduced and the analysis extends to fantastic, comparative, associative and implicative fuzzy filters within a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated framework. Finally, it is proven that an associative fuzzy filter in K inherently satisfies the criteria for both implicative and comparative fuzzy filters.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-165/v2?src=rss">Engaging Sustainable Reforestation and Forest Protection in the Wallacea Line, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                Background Vitamin D may play an important role in later-life physical and cognitive health. Vitamin D status is standardly assessed in serum and plasma; however, collection, transport, and storage costs make large epidemiologic studies challenging. We assessed the agreement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) quantification from dried blood spots (DBS) as compared to standard plasma assessment among older Indian adults. Methods A total of 58 adults over 45 years of age who resided in Pune, India were enrolled in the study from July 2020 to June 2021. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess 25(OH)D3 concentrations in paired plasma and DBS samples. Results Plasma and DBS 25(OH)D3 concentrations were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.976). The median 25(OH)D3 concentration of the study population assessed by plasma was 14.6 ng/mL (Q1=12.0, Q3= 18.1) while the median concentration assessed in DBS was 12.8 ng/mL (Q1=11.0, Q3= 16.6). 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured from DBS were on average 6% (95% CI: 2-13%) lower than concentrations assessed by plasma across the observed 25(OH)D3 distribution. Conclusions We found good agreement between 25(OH)D3 quantification between DBS and plasma and our findings indicate that DBS can be used in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D among Indian adults.

                Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 1.3% to 4% of paediatric appendectomies. It is the most common complication after an appendectomy. Surgical complications in paediatric patients increase patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections, falls and drug-related side effects The aim of this study was to identify the modifiable risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Methodology Paediatric patients who underwent appendectomies from April 2018 to April 2023 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in coastal Karnataka were included. Clinical characteristics of patients were collected from the medical records of the patients. Results A total of 459 paediatric patients underwent appendectomies between 2018 and 2023. 45 (9.8%) developed surgical site infections (SSIs). Chi-squared tests (or Fisher’s exact tests, where appropriate) revealed significant associations (p < 0.05) between SSIs and the following categorical variables: faecal incontinence, surgical technique, wound type, type of appendicitis, postoperative stay and use of invasive devices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis further identified laparotomy (OR = 4.39, 95% CI: 1.31–14.74), presence of invasive devices (OR = 104.4, 95% CI: 5.45–2002.93), longer consultation-to-surgery time (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17–1.88), and increased surgery duration (OR = 1.02 per minute, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04) as independent risk factors significantly associated with the development of SSIs. Discussion The study identified laparotomy, use of drains, delayed surgery, and longer operation time as key risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Despite standard precautions, high SSI rates were observed, likely due to modifiable surgical factors and antimicrobial resistance. The findings highlight the need for optimized surgical practices, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary strategies to reduce SSI rates and improve patient outcomes.

[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897.

                Introduction phlebitis is one of the complications associated with the placement of peripheral intravascular lines in neonates and serves as an indicator of the quality of care provided by health professionals. Determining its incidence and predictors provides valuable evidence for stakeholders to address this issue and the potential factors contributing to phlebitis. Objective This study aims to determine the incidence and predictors of phlebitis among neonates with perinatal asphyxia admitted at the neonatal intensive care unit of West Amhara Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023. Method A multicentered, institution-based prospective follow-up study was conducted from May 1 to August 30, 2024, at the Northwest Amhara Region Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was employed, and data were collected using a data extraction checklist from the medical registry of neonates. The collected data were entered into EPI-DATA V.4.6.0.0 and analyzed using STATA V.14. The Kaplan-Meier failure curve and log-rank test were utilized, and both bivariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of phlebitis. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Result The overall incidence of phlebitis was 20.9 per 1,000 neonate-day observations (95% CI: 17.12-25.54) during the entire follow-up period. Of the 423 neonates admitted to the NICU, 96 (22.69%) (95% CI: 18.93-26.94) developed phlebitis. Significant predictors included birth asphyxia (AHR= 2.1; 95% CI: 1.38-3.19), trials of cannulation (AHR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.01-6.36), macrosomic neonates (AHR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.17-7.96), flushed cannulas (AHR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.31-0.97), and short dwelling time (AHR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.765). Conculsion The incidence rate of phlebitis was higher than that reported in other studies. Predictors of phlebitis included birth asphyxia, the number of cannulation trials, macrosomic neonates, flushed cannulas, and shorter dwelling times.

                Introduction Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a serious concern for preterm infants and can predispose such infants to brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim The present study aimed to determine the frequency of IVH and its risk factors in the premature newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at King Fahd University Hospital. Methodology This cross-sectional study involved 201 preterm neonates admitted at King Fahd University Hospital, Khobar, Saudi Arabia over a period of 7 years (from 2016 to 2023). These neonates were diagnosed by cranial ultrasound. IVH was classified into four grades based on Papile classification. The frequency of IVH was compared across various attributing factors i.e., gestational age at delivery, gender, birth weight, mode of delivery, and maternal antenatal steroids. Results Two hundred and one patients were analyzed (male 50.7% vs. female 49.3%). 51.2% had a gestational age of 29 weeks or less. More than half (54.2%) had a birth weight of ≤1200g. The incidence of IVH in a 7-year duration was 41.8%, with stage 1 (41.7%) and stage 2 (34.5%) being the most common IVH stages. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that CHD, seizure, and ROP were identified as the significant independent predictors of IVH among preterm infants. Conclusion IVH in premature infants remains a complex and delicate issue in neonatology. An integrated approach covering both prevention and treatment is essential to minimize the negative impact of this complication on the neurological development of premature infants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v1?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Income gaps threaten democratic vitality, yet the evidence is mixed on whether economic inequality inevitably suppresses citizens’ political voices. We argue that institutional integrity—particularly the capacity to curb corruption—conditions how inequality translates into civic disengagement. By embedding governance quality in the inequality-participation debate, this study addresses a significant omission in comparative political-economy scholarship and offers policy-relevant insights. Methods We compile a balanced panel of ten democracies—Australia, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa—for 2002-2022. Voice and Accountability (Worldwide Governance Indicators) are the outcome variable; predictors include the lagged Gini Index, extreme poverty headcount, GDP-per-capita growth, and five governance metrics. Country- and year-fixed-effects regressions with cluster-robust errors are estimated. Diagnostic tests (Pesaran LM, IPS, Westerlund, VIF) guide specification and interaction terms to assess whether strong corruption control moderates inequality’s impact in developed versus developing subsamples. Results Corruption control is the strongest positive predictor of democratic voice, while inequality and poverty are insignificant in isolation. Interaction models reveal pronounced asymmetries. In developed economies, the deleterious effect of inequality is neutralised—and sometimes reversed—when corruption is tightly controlled (β = +0.028, p < 0.01). In developing economies, inequality remains benign until corruption escalates, at which point higher Gini scores significantly erode Voice and Accountability (β = -0.020, p ≈ 0.07). Corrected models confirm a modest universal adverse effect of inequality once institutional dynamics are constant. Conclusions Inequality is not destiny; its democratic toll depends on whether institutions can control corruption. Policy agendas that redistribute income will underperform if they neglect governance reforms. Combating graft, professionalising public administration, and expanding digital feedback channels can shield civic participation even in unequal societies. Conversely, failing to fortify institutions leaves democracies—especially developing ones—vulnerable to a corrosive feedback loop of widening gaps and falling political voices.

                Demenego et al. show that inborn errors of immunity (IEI) directly impact neurodevelopment independently of immune dysfunction. In WHIM syndrome, CXCR4 hyperactivation disrupts cerebellar assembly and behavior via cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Early brain-targeted CXCR4 antagonist rescues both structural and psychomotor defects. The study redefines the neurodevelopmental origins of IEI-associated symptoms.

                Memories do not reflect the continuous nature of experience—they represent distinct events. How does the brain know when one memory should end and the next should begin? Clewett et al. show that during meaningful changes, increased arousal and locus coeruleus activation trigger the formation of separate episodic memories.

                Sustained androgen receptor (AR) inhibition is a clinical challenge due to multiple AR reactivation mechanisms. Hence, delineating the signaling pathways downstream of AR that promote cancer progression may nominate novel, alternative therapeutic targets. Lin et al. identify CAMKI-CREB-mediated cholesterol metabolism as an alternative, AMPK-independent, and druggable pathway mediating AR-CAMKK2-driven CRPC.

                Chou et al. demonstrate that CEP164 recruits TTBK2 to centriole distal appendages through phase separation driven by electrostatic interactions between their intrinsically disordered regions. This multivalent interaction forms dynamic condensates, facilitating efficient TTBK2 recruitment and initiating ciliogenesis, highlighting the critical role of phase separation in cilia formation.

                Burgmer et al. show that the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE repress key metabolic functions in the Drosophila midgut. These regulations occur independently of canonical immune pathways and restrict parasitic Wolbachia endosymbionts in the intestine and peripheral tissues. Thus, PRRs act beyond canonical immune pathways to control bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00573-X?rss=yes">RNA m6A dynamics promote transcription and RNA stability of bivalent genes during iPSC-induced generation of human lung progenitors</a></h4>

              
                Dong et al. show that stage-specific m6A dynamics direct human iPSC differentiation into lung progenitors. The upregulation of RBM15B induces m6A hypermethylation in differentiated stages, while the switch between m6A readers YTHDC1 and IGF2BP2 coordinates chromatin remodeling and mRNA stability control of bivalent genes critical for lung endoderm specification.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00565-0?rss=yes">MYB68 regulates radial endodermal differentiation and suberin patterning</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Kraska et al. identify MYB68 as a novel regulator of endodermal suberization, linked to the formation of distinct identities in the xylem-pole-associated endodermis. The research uncovers new insights into the patterning of the endodermis with suberin and highlights genes encoding K-transport proteins associated with endodermal passage cells.
