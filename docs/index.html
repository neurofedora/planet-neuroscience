	<p>Objective: To explore whether deep medullary veins (DMVs) in the unaffected hemisphere were associated with functional outcome in acute cardioembolic stroke patients. Methods: Acute cardioembolic stroke patients at a single center were retrospectively included. DMVs visibility in the unaffected hemisphere was assessed using a well-established four-grade scoring method based on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI): grades 0&amp;amp;ndash;3 (grade 0 for no visible DMVs; grade 1 for the numbers of conspicuous DMVs &amp;amp;lt; 5; grade 2 for numbers raging from 5 to 10; grade 3 for more than 10). Patients were further divided into mild-to-moderate (grade 0&amp;amp;ndash;2) and severe DMVs (grade 3) groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at three months. Poor outcome was defined as mRS &amp;amp;ge; 3. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between DMVs grade and functional outcome. Results: A total of 170 patients were finally included. Compared with the mild-to-moderate DMVs group (149 patients), the severe DMVs group (21 patients) had higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p = 0.002), lower levels of admission systolic blood pressure (BP) (p = 0.031), and elevated rates of large infarction (p = 0.003). At three months, the severe DMVs group had higher mRS (p = 0.002). Patients in the poor outcome group (82/170, 48.2%) had older age, higher baseline NIHSS score, lower admission diastolic BP, higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation and large infarction, and an increased proportion of severe DMVs (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, multivariable regression analysis showed that the severe DMVs grade (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.830, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.266&amp;amp;ndash;26.856, p = 0.024) was significantly associated with three-month functional outcomes without interaction with other potential risk factors (p for interaction &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: DMVs grade in the unaffected hemisphere was independently associated with three-month functional outcome in acute cardioembolic stroke patients. Patients with severe DMVs were more likely to have a poor functional outcome at three months.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phosphorylation Determines Whether Neuroligin-3 is at Excitatory or Inhibitory Synapses in Different Regions of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuroligin-3 is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule involved in development, function, and pathologies of synapses in the brain. It is a genetic cause of autism and a potent component of the tumor microenvironment in gliomas. There are four Neuroligins that operate at distinct synapse types, selectively interacting with presynaptic adhesion and postsynaptic scaffold proteins. We investigated the subcellular localization and scaffold specificities of synaptic Neuroligin-3 and demonstrate an unexpected pattern of localization to excitatory synapses in cortical areas, and inhibitory synapses in subcortical areas. Using phosphoproteomics, we identify Neuroligin-3-specific serine phosphorylation in cortex and hippocampus that obstructs a key binding site for inhibitory synapse scaffolds. Using in utero CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and replacement with phosphomimetic mutants, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site determines excitatory versus inhibitory synapse localization of Neuroligin-3 in vivo. Our data reveal a mechanism that differentially regulates the balance of Neuroligin-3 between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, adding to our emerging understanding of their role in the development of brain connectivity and associated pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mouse primary visual cortex neurons respond to the illusory ''darker than black'' in neon color spreading.</a></h4>

              
                Illusions are a powerful tool for studying the single neuron correlates of perception. Here, we introduce the neon color spreading (NCS) illusion in mice and report the neuronal correlates of illusory brightness, which has heretofore only been studied using human fMRI. We designed a novel NCS paradigm to evoke the percept of an illusory drifting grating and analyzed the activity of 520 single units in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). A substantial proportion of V1 single units (60.5%) responded to illusory gratings with direction tuning matched to their preferred direction, which was determined using physically presented luminance-defined gratings (LDG). Moreover, by presenting LDG gratings with a 180 {degrees} phase shift relative to NCS gratings, we show that spatial phase tuning shifted 180 {degrees} for most single units. This finding conclusively demonstrates that V1 single units respond to illusory brightness. Using this novel mouse paradigm, we show that responses to illusory gratings have a lower magnitude and are delayed relative to physical gratings. We determined where V1 single units fell in the V1 cellular hierarchy (based on their susceptibility to surround suppression, their putative classification as interneuron or pyramidal neuron, and designation as a simple or complex cell) and found that higher-level V1 single units are more responsive to NCS stimuli. These findings resolve the debate of whether V1 is involved in illusory brightness processing and reveal a V1 hierarchical organization in which higher-level neurons are pivotal to the processing of illusory qualities, such as brightness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient in vivo neuronal genome editing in the mouse brain using nanocapsules containing CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins</a></h4>

              
                Genome editing of somatic cells via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) offers promise for new therapeutics to treat a variety of genetic disorders, including neurological diseases. However, the dense and complex parenchyma of the brain and the post-mitotic state of neurons make efficient genome editing challenging. In vivo delivery systems for CRISPR-Cas proteins and single guide RNA (sgRNA) include both viral vectors and non-viral strategies, each presenting different advantages and disadvantages for clinical application. We developed non-viral and biodegradable PEGylated nanocapsules (NCs) that deliver preassembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Here, we show that the RNP NCs led to robust genome editing in neurons following intracerebral injection into the mouse striatum. Genome editing was predominantly observed in medium spiny neurons (>80%), with occasional editing in cholinergic, calretinin, and parvalbumin interneurons. Glial activation was minimal and was localized along the needle tract. Our results demonstrate that the RNP NCs are capable of safe and efficient neuronal genome editing in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in gamma bursts supporting working memory development through adolescence derived from EEG spectral processing</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a stage of development characterized by neurodevelopmental specialization of cognitive processes. In particular, working memory continues to improve through adolescence, with increases in response accuracy and decreases in response latency continuing well into the twenties. Human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate that gamma oscillations (30-75 Hz) during the working memory delay period support the maintenance of mnemonic information guiding subsequent goal driven behavior, which decreases in power with development. Importantly, recent electrophysiological studies have shown that gamma bursts, and not sustained activity, reinstate working memory during the delay period. Developmental changes in gamma bursts during working memory, have not been studied. Thus, we used EEG in conjunction with a novel spectral event processing approach to investigate age-related changes in transient gamma band activity during a memory guided saccade (MGS) task in 164 10- to 30-year-olds. As expected, accuracy improved, and latency decreased with age. EEG results indicated robust age-related decreases in mean gamma power and the number of gamma band events during both the working memory delay epoch but also the fixation epoch before working memory encoding, suggesting age-related change in core aspects of information processing. Relationships between gamma events and behavior however were only evident during the working memory delay period and only during adolescence where more gamma events were associated with faster latency and trial level event variability was associated with latency variability. These results suggest a process of specialization where developmental decreases in gamma events into adulthood support working memory responses reflecting optimization of executive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Closed-loop brain stimulation to reduce pathologic fear</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive processing of trauma related memory engrams leads to dysregulated fear reactions. In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dysfunctional extinction learning prevents discretization of trauma-related memory engrams and leads to generalized fear responses. PTSD is postulated as a mnemonic-based disorder, but we lack markers or treatments targeting pathological fear memory processing. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) and concurrent neocortical oscillations are scaffolds to consolidate contextual memory, but their role during fear processing remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that closed-loop SWRs triggered neuromodulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) can enhance the consolidation of fear extinction. It modified fear memories that became resistant to induced recall (i.e., "renewal" and "reinstatement") and did not reemerge spontaneously as a PTSD-like phenotype. The effects are mediated by D2 receptor signaling induced synaptic remodeling in the basolateral amygdala. These results suggest that SWRs help consolidating fear extinction memories. Furthermore, enhancing the consolidation of extinction engrams by SWR-triggered induction of reward signals can alleviate pathologic fear reactions in a rodent model of PSTD. No adverse effects were seen, suggesting this potential therapy for PTSD and anxiety disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural plasticity of axon initial segment in spinal cord neurons underlies inflammatory pain</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent structural plasticity of axon initial segment (AIS) regulates neuronal excitability, thus fine-tuning neuronal and overall network output. Here using behavioral, immunohistochemical, electrophysiological and computational approaches, we describe the structural plasticity of AIS in rat superficial spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) neurons, which underlies inflammatory pain. We show an inflammation-mediated distal shift of the AIS away from the soma in inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons, concomitant with the peak of inflammatory pain. This AIS translocation was accompanied by a decrease in excitability of the inhibitory neurons. Following recovery from inflammatory hyperalgesia, the AIS location and neuronal excitability reversed to baseline levels. The computational model of SDH inhibitory neurons predicts that the distal shift of AIS is sufficient to decrease the intrinsic excitability of these neurons. Our results provide evidence of differential inflammation-mediated AIS plasticity, reducing the excitability of inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons and contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An intestinal sphingolipid promotes neuronal health across generations</a></h4>

              
                Maternal diet and environment can influence the neuronal health of offspring. Here, we report that diet-induced intestinal sphingolipid biosynthesis reduces adult-onset neurodegeneration intergenerationally in Caenorhabditis elegans. Feeding C. elegans with ursolic acid (UA), a natural plant product, provides neuroprotection by enhancing maternal provisioning of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) - a bioactive sphingolipid. S1P promotes neuronal health across generations by upregulating transcription of the acid ceramidase-1 (asah-1) gene in the intestine. Intergenerational intestine-to-oocyte S1P transfer is essential for promoting neuronal health and is dependent on the lipoprotein yolk receptor RME-2 (Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis-2). Spatially regulating sphingolipid biosynthesis is critical, as inappropriate asah-1 neuronal expression causes developmental axon outgrowth defects. Our results reveal that sphingolipid homeostasis impacts the development and intergenerational health of the nervous system.

	<p>Humans and rodents have sexually dimorphic immune responses, which could influence the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to a systemic inflammatory insult. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a stimulator of the innate immune system and is routinely used in animal models to study blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we examined whether inflammatory response to LPS and the associated BBB disruption differed in male and female adult rats. Rats were treated with saline or two injections of 1 mg/kg LPS and studied 24 h after the second LPS injection. Plasma isolated from trunk blood and brain tissue homogenates of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal striatum (DS), hippocampus, and cerebellum were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines using a 9-plex panel from Meso Scale Discovery. BBB disruption was analyzed with tight junction proteins claudin-5 and VE-cadherin via Western blotting and VEGF by ELISA. This allowed us to compare sex differences in the levels of individual cytokines as well as associations among cytokines and expression of tight junction proteins between the plasma and specific brain regions. Higher levels of interferon-&amp;amp;gamma;, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-13, IL-4, CXCL-1, and VEGF in the plasma were revealed compared to the brain homogenates, and higher levels of TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, and IL-5 in the PFC were seen compared with plasma and other brain regions in males. Females showed higher levels of plasma CXCL1 and VEGF compared to males, and males showed higher levels of PFC TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-6, IL-4, and VEGF compared to females. LPS induced significant increases in plasma cytokines and VEGF in both sexes. LPS did not significantly alter cytokines in brain tissue homogenates, however, it increased chemokines in the PFC, DS, and hippocampus. In the PFC, LPS produced BBB disruption, which is evident as reduced expression of claudin-5 in males and reduced expression of VE-cadherin in both sexes. Taken together, our results reveal significant sex differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in plasma and brain that were associated with BBB disruption after LPS, and validate the use of multiplex assay for plasma and brain tissue samples.</p>

	<p>The use of electroencephalography to recognize human emotions is a key technology for advancing human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interactions. This study proposes an improved deep convolutional neural network model for emotion classification using a non-end-to-end training method that combines bottom-, middle-, and top-layer convolution features. Four sets of experiments using 4500 samples were conducted to verify model performance. Simultaneously, feature visualization technology was used to extract the three-layer features obtained by the model, and a scatterplot analysis was performed. The proposed model achieved a very high accuracy of 93.7%, and the extracted features exhibited the best separability among the tested models. We found that adding redundant layers did not improve model performance, and removing the data of specific channels did not significantly reduce the classification effect of the model. These results indicate that the proposed model allows for emotion recognition with a higher accuracy and speed than the previously reported models. We believe that our approach can be implemented in various applications that require the quick and accurate identification of human emotions.</p>

	<p>Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a kind of prevalent emotional disorder following stroke that usually results in slow functional recovery and even increased mortality. We had reported that the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2R) antagonist HAMI3379 (HM3379) contributes to the improvement of neurological injury. The present study was designed to investigate the role of HM3379 in PSD-induced chronic neuroinflammation and related mechanisms in gerbils. The gerbils were subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) and spatial restraint stress to induce the PSD model. They were randomized to receive the vehicle or HM3379 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) for a consecutive 14 days. In the PSD-treated gerbils, HM3379 had noteworthy efficacy in improving the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and depression-like behaviors, including the sucrose preference test and the forced swim test. HM3379 administration significantly mitigated neuron loss, lessened TUNEL-positive neurons, and reduced the activation of microglia in the cerebral cortex. Importantly, HM3379 downregulated protein expressions of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and pyroptosis including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, interleukin-1&amp;amp;beta; (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), IL-18, cleaved gasdermin-N domain (GSDMD-N), and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC). Mechanistically, HM3379 could repress pyroptosis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stimulation. Knockdown of CysLT2R by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or overexpression of CysLT2R by lentivirus (LV)-CysLT2R could abolish or restore the anti-depression effect of HM3379. Our results demonstrated that the selective CysLT2R antagonist HM3379 has beneficial effects on PSD, partially by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis pathway.</p>

	<p>Acute or chronic exposures to pesticides have been linked to neurotoxicity and the potential development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). This study aimed to consider the neurotoxicity of three widely utilized pesticides: malathion, chlorpyrifos, and paraquat within the hippocampus (HC), corpus striatum (CS), cerebellum (CER), and cerebral cortex (CC). Neurotoxicity was evaluated at relatively low, medium, and high pesticide dosages. All pesticides inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and neuropathy target esterase (NTE) in each of the brain regions, but esterase inhibition was greatest in the HC and CS. Each of the pesticides also induced greater disruption to cellular bioenergetics within the HC and CS, and this was monitored via inhibition of mitochondrial complex enzymes I and II, reduced ATP levels, and increased lactate production. Similarly, the HC and CS were more vulnerable to redox stress, with greater inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase and increased lipid peroxidation. All pesticides induced the production of nuclear Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these results show that pesticides disrupt cellular bioenergetics and that the HC and CS are more susceptible to pesticide effects than the CER and CC.</p>

	<p>Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a chronic brain disorder that involves frequent failures of inhibitory control and relapses into methamphetamine intake. However, it remains unclear whether the impairment of inhibitory control in MUD is proactive, reactive or both. To address this issue, the current study used the conditional stop-signal task to assess proactive and reactive inhibitory control in 35 MUD patients with long-term abstinence and 35 matched healthy controls. The results showed that MUD patients with long-term abstinence had greater preparation costs than healthy controls, but did not differ in performance, implying a less efficient utilization of proactive inhibitory control. In contrast, MUD patients exhibited intact reactive inhibitory control; reactive but not proactive inhibitory control was associated with high sensation seeking in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that proactive and reactive inhibitory control may be two different important endophenotypes of addiction in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. The current study provides new insight into the uses of proactive and reactive inhibitory control to effectively evaluate and precisely treat MUD patients with long-term abstinence.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have indicated that vitamin (Vit) D deficiency is frequent in psychiatric patients, regardless of diagnostic category. We aimed to assess whether acute psychiatric relapses in inpatients was associated with Vit D deficiency compared to stabilized outpatients. The cohort (152 total patients, 75 males and 77 females) had a mean age of 47.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.4 years at admission and was grouped according to psychiatric diagnosis. Psychopathological symptom severity was assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multidimensional symptom inventory. Total calcium serum levels were measured using standard laboratory methods, while plasma levels of 25-OH-Vit D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured by automated chemiluminescence immunoassays. The psychiatric inpatient subgroup showed a significant difference in serum levels of 25-OH-Vit D and PTH (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Correlation analysis between serum levels of 25-OH-Vit D and BPRS total and subitem scores indicated a significantly negative relationship. In addition, linear regression analysis evidenced that the inpatient condition might predict low PTH and 25-OH-Vit D serum levels. Hospitalized psychiatric patients are at increased risk for Vit D deficiency regardless of their diagnostic categories. The mechanism underlying the association between acute psychiatric relapses and Vit D deficiency remains unclear. Therefore, screening for Vit D deficiency should pertain to the health assessment of patients with major psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Risk factors for hippocampal cavities in a marginally housed population</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cavities in the hippocampus are morphological variants of uncertain significance. Aberrant neurodevelopment along with vascular and inflammatory etiologies have been proposed. We sought to characterize these cavities and their potential risk factors in a marginally housed population, with high rates of viral infection, addiction, and mental illness. (1) The volume of hippocampal cavities (HCavs) is greater in this highly multimorbid population compared to the general population. (2) Conventional vascular risk factors such as greater age and systolic blood pressure are associated with higher HCav volume. (3) Nonprescribed substance-related risk factors such as stimulant use or dependence, and smoking are associated with increased HCav volume independent of vascular risk factors. This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective study. We analyzed baseline data, including medical history, physical exam, psychiatric diagnosis, and MRI from a total of 375 participants. Hippocampal cavities were defined as spaces isointense to CSF on T1 MRI sequences, bounded on all sides by hippocampal tissue, with a volume of at least 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Risk factors were evaluated using negative binomial multiple regression. Stimulant use was reported by 87.3% of participants, with stimulant dependence diagnosed in 83.3% of participants. Prevalence of cavities was 71.6%, with a mean total bilateral HCav volume of 13.89 mm<sup>3</sup>. On average, a 1 mmHg greater systolic blood pressure was associated with a 2.17% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [0.57%, 3.79%], p = .0076), while each cigarette smoked per day trended toward a 2.69% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [−0.87%, 5.54%], p = .058). A diagnosis of stimulant dependence was associated with a 95.6% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [5.39%, 263.19%], p = .0335). Hypertension and diagnosis of stimulant dependence were associated with a greater total volume of HCav.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Debate continues regarding the possible role of the hippocampus across short-term and working memory tasks. The current study examined the possibility of a hippocampal contribution to precise, high-resolution cognition and conjunctive memory. We administered visual working memory tasks featuring a continuous response component to a well-established developmental amnesic patient with relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage (Jon) and healthy controls. The patient was able to produce highly accurate response judgments regarding conjunctions of color and orientation or color and location, using simultaneous or sequential presentation of stimuli, with no evidence of any impairment in working memory binding, categorical accuracy, or continuous precision. These findings indicate that hippocampal damage does not necessarily lead to deficits in high-resolution cognitive performance, even when the damage is severe and bilateral.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Episodic memory binds the spatial and temporal relationships between the elements of experience. The hippocampus encodes space through place cells that fire at specific spatial locations. Similarly, time cells fire sequentially at specific time points within a temporally organized experience. Recent studies in rodents, monkeys, and humans have identified time cells with discrete firing fields and cells with monotonically changing activity in supporting the temporal organization of events across multiple timescales. Using in vivo electrophysiological tetrode recordings, we simultaneously recorded neurons from the prefrontal cortex and dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus while rats performed a delayed match to sample task. During the treadmill mnemonic delay, hippocampal time cells exhibited sparser firing fields with decreasing resolution over time, consistent with previous results. In comparison, temporally modulated cells in the prefrontal cortex showed more monotonically changing firing rates, ramping up or decaying with the passage of time, and exhibited greater temporal precision for Bayesian decoding of time at long time lags. These time cells show exquisite temporal resolution both in their firing fields and in the fine timing of spikes relative to the phase of theta oscillations. Here, we report evidence of theta phase precession in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the temporal delay, however, hippocampal cells exhibited steeper phase precession slopes and more punctate time fields. To disentangle whether time cell activity reflects elapsed time or distance traveled, we varied the treadmill running speed on each trial. While many neurons contained multiplexed representations of time and distance, both regions were more strongly influenced by time than distance. Overall, these results demonstrate the flexible integration of spatiotemporal dimensions and reveal complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in supporting memory-guided behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females primarily caused by loss of function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MeCP2. Loss of MeCP2 leads to a host of synaptic phenotypes that are believed to underlie Rett syndrome pathophysiology. Synaptic deficits vary by brain region upon MeCP2 loss, suggesting distinct molecular alterations leading to disparate synaptic outcomes. In this study, we examined the contribution of MeCP2's newly described role in miRNA regulation to regional molecular and synaptic impairments. Two miRNAs, miR-101a and miR-203, were identified and confirmed as upregulated in MeCP2 KO mice in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. miR-101a overexpression in hippocampal cultures led to opposing effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and in spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission, revealing the potential for a single miRNA to broadly regulate synapse function in the hippocampus. These results highlight the importance of regional alterations in miRNA expression and the specific impact on synaptic function with potential implications for Rett syndrome.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to discriminate between one's own and others' body parts can be lost after brain damage, as in patients who misidentify someone else's hand as their own (pathological embodiment). Surprisingly, these patients do not use visual information to discriminate between the own and the alien hand. We asked whether this impaired visual discrimination emerges only in the ecological evaluation when the pathological embodiment is triggered by the physical alien hand (the examiner's one) or whether it emerges also when hand images are displayed on a screen. Forty right brain-damaged patients, with (E+ = 20) and without (E− = 20) pathological embodiment, and 24 healthy controls underwent two tasks in which stimuli depicting self and other hands was adopted. In the Implicit task, where participants judged which of two images matched a central target, the self-advantage (better performance with Self than Other stimuli) selectively emerges in controls, but not in patients. Moreover, E+ patients show a significantly lower performance with respect to both controls and E− patients, whereas E− patients were comparable to controls. In the Explicit task, where participants judged which stimuli belonged to themselves, both E− and E+ patients performed worst when compared to controls, but only E+ patients hyper-attributed others' hand to themselves (i.e., false alarms) as observed during the ecological evaluation. The VLSM revealed that SLF damage was significantly associated with the tendency of committing false alarm errors. We demonstrate that, in E+ patients, the ability to visually recognize the own body is lost, at both implicit and explicit level.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Foundations and implications of astrocyte heterogeneity during brain development and disease</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play crucial roles in regulating brain circuit formation and physiology. Recent technological advances have revealed unprecedented levels of astrocyte diversity encompassing molecular, morphological, and functional differences. This diversification is initiated during embryonic specification events and (in rodents) continues into the early postnatal period where it overlaps with peak synapse development and circuit refinement. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest astrocyte diversity both influences and is a consequence of molecular crosstalk among developing astrocytes and other cell types, notably neurons and their synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration and identification of a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.</a></h4>

              
                The gut brain axis is thought to play a role in behavior and physiological responses through chemical, immunological, and metabolite signaling. Antibiotics, diet, and drugs can alter the transit time of gut contents as well as the makeup of the microbiome. Heterogeneity in genetics and environment are also well-known factors involved in the initiation and perpetuation of substance use disorders. Few viable genetic or biological markers are available to identify individuals who are at risk of escalating opioid intake. Primarily, the addiction field has focused on the nervous system, limiting the discovery of peripheral factors that contribute to addiction. To address this gap, we characterized the microbiome before and after drug exposure, and after antibiotics depletion in male and female heterogenous stock rats to determine if microbiome constituents are protective of escalation. We hypothesized that individuals that are prone to escalation of opioid self-administration will have distinct microbial and metabolic profiles. The fecal microbiome and behavioral responses were measured over several weeks of oxycodone self-administration and after antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by depleting microbes that ferment fiber into these essential signaling molecules for the gut-brain axis. Depletion of the microbiome increased oxycodone self-administration in a subpopulation of animals (Responders). Supplementation of SCFAs in antibiotic depleted animals decreased elevated oxycodone self-administration. Phylogenetic functional analysis reveals distinct metabolic differences in the subpopulations of animals that are sensitive to antibiotic depletion and animals rescued by SCFA supplementation. In conclusion, this study identifies pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration, demonstrates that escalation of oxycodone self-administration dysregulates the microbiome and metabolic landscape, and identifies a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of individual differences in response to methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in animal models of opioid use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Current medications for opioid use disorder include buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. While these medications show significant efficacy in reducing craving and opioid use, there are substantial individual differences in response to these treatments in humans. The reason for such difference is poorly known. Objectives: Here, we tested the hypothesis that similar individual differences may be observed in a large population of heterogenous stock rats, that have been bred to maximize genetic diversity, using a behavioral paradigm relevant to opioid use disorder. Methods: Over 500 rats were given intermittent (4d/week) and extended access (12h/day) to oxycodone self-administration for 14 sessions to establish oxycodone dependence and escalation of intake. We then measured the effect of buprenorphine (0.5mg/kg), methadone (3mg/kg) and naltrexone (3mg/kg) on the motivation to self-administer oxycodone by using a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Results: We found that naltrexone and buprenorphine significantly decreased motivation to oxycodone rewards. While naltrexone reduced oxycodone intake in both males and females, systemic administration with buprenorphine reduced progressive ratio responses only in males. Methadone reduced motivation to oxycodone self-administration in nearly 25% of the population, without reaching statical significance. Our results showed that the efficacy of these medications depends on the severity of addiction like behaviors, indicated by the addiction index. Conclusions: These results demonstrate individual differences in response to medications to treat opioid use disorder in a genetically diverse population of rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential effects of oxytocin receptor antagonist on social rank and other social behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social rank within a group is essential for survival in many animals. Rank in the community helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts and establish stable relationships with others. Recently, oxytocin has received increasing attention for its function in social behavior. However, the causal relationship between oxytocin levels and social rank has remained unclear. Here, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist L-368-899 on (1) social rank, (2) sex preference, and (3) dyadic interaction in male mice. In the tube test, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist had no effect on first-place mice, but caused rank fluctuation of the social rank in second-place mice, suggesting that the function of oxytocin in the maintenance of the social rank is rank-dependent. Second, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist dose-dependently impaired the sex preference of the male mice, confirming that oxytocin is essential in sexual behavior. Third, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist had no effect on the dyadic interaction between the male mice, suggesting that oxytocin is not necessary in direct social interaction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the role of the oxytocin in male mice is limited to a specific context of social behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions modulate electrically evoked EEG responses in mice</a></h4>

              
                Perturbational complexity analysis predicts the presence of consciousness in humans by stimulating the brain with a brief pulse, recording cortical responses with electroencephalography (EEG), and measuring their spatiotemporal complexity. Measures reflecting perturbational complexity are low when consciousness vanishes in deep sleep, general anesthesia, or after widespread brain damage, and are high during wake, dreaming sleep and after recovery from brain injury. Here we examine the neural circuits underlying perturbational complexity in a mouse model by directly stimulating the cortex and recording high-density EEG, as well as spiking activity throughout the cortico-thalamo-cortical system with up to three Neuropixels probes, while subjects are awake or anesthetized via isoflurane. We find that when the mouse is awake, stimulation of deep cortical layers reliably evokes locally a brief pulse of excitation, followed by a bi-phasic sequence of a 120 ms profound off period and a rebound excitation. A similar pattern of spiking activity, some of which can be attributed to burst spiking, is seen in the connected thalamic nuclei. These spiking patterns are associated with a pronounced late component in the evoked EEG. We infer that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions drive the long-lasting evoked EEG signals elicited by deep cortical stimulation during the awake state. The cortical and thalamic off period and rebound excitation, as well as the late component in the EEG, are reduced in running mice and are absent in animals anesthetized with isoflurane. This is also mirrored in the perturbational complexity indices computed during quiet wakefulness, running, and anesthetized states. Taken together, these results suggest that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions contribute to ongoing activity in the conscious state that leads to highly complex global responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity manifolds and ion-channel degeneracy govern circadian oscillations of neuronal intrinsic properties in the suprachiasmatic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Motivation and methods: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock of the mammalian brain that sustains a neural code for circadian time through oscillations in the firing rate of constituent neurons. These cell-autonomous oscillations in intrinsic properties are mediated by plasticity in a subset of ion-channels expressed in SCN neurons and are maintained despite widespread neuron-to-neuron variability in ion channel expression profiles. How do SCN neurons undergo stable transitions and maintain precision in intrinsic properties spanning the day-night cycle if several ion channels change concomitantly in a heterogeneous neuronal population? Here, we address this important question using unbiased stochastic searches on the parametric and the plasticity spaces using populations of SCN models, each explored for multiple valid transitions spanning one complete circadian cycle (day-to-night followed by night-to-day transitions). Results: Our analyses provided three fundamental insights about the impact of heterogeneities on the circadian oscillations of SCN intrinsic properties. First, SCN neurons could achieve signature electrophysiological characteristics (day-like or night-like) despite pronounced heterogeneity in ion channel conductances, with weak pairwise correlations between their conductance values. This ion-channel degeneracy precluded the need to maintain precise ion-channel expression profiles for achieving characteristic electrophysiological signatures of SCN neurons, thus allowing for parametric heterogeneities despite functional precision. Second, it was not essential that specific conductances had to change by precise values for obtaining valid day-to-night or night-to-day transitions. This plasticity degeneracy, the ability of disparate combinations of ion-channel plasticity to yield the same functional transition, confers flexibility on individual neurons to take one of several routes to achieve valid transitions. Finally, we performed nonlinear dimensionality reduction analyses on the valid plasticity spaces and found the manifestation of a low-dimensional plasticity manifold in day-to-night transitions, but not in night-to-day transitions. These observations demonstrated that the concomitant changes in multiple ion channels are not arbitrary, but follow a structured plasticity manifold that provides a substrate for stability in achieving stable circadian oscillations. Implications: Our analyses unveil an elegant substrate, involving a synthesis of the degeneracy and the plasticity manifold frameworks, to effectuate stable circadian oscillations in a heterogeneous population of SCN neurons. Within this framework, the ability of multiple ion channels to change concomitantly provides robustness and flexibility to effectively achieve precise transitions despite widespread heterogeneities in ion-channel expression and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-based Lifespan Trajectories of Social Cognition: From Resting-state fMRI Perspective</a></h4>

              
                Brain lifespan trajectories of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in social cognition (SC) provide comprehensive insight and effective reference for normal development and clinical intervention. Unfortunately, for a lack of lifespan samples, the neural mechanism underlying SC in a lifespan developmental perspective is largely unknown, though relative behavior evidence has been investigated well. We, based on common functional networks, aim to map out voxel-wise iFC features between the SC networks and the entire cerebral cortex and further chart its corresponding trajectory patterns across the lifespan. Three networks, namely moral cognition, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy, are chosen as representatives of core SC networks. NKI-RS Enhanced (N = 316, ages 8-83 years old) dataset is selected as a lifespan resting-state fMRI dataset to delineate iFC characteristics and construct developmental trajectories. The result shows that the SC networks represent dissociable and network-specific connectivity profiles. Empathy network, as the most age-related susceptible network, shows a linear up trend with dorsal attention network, a linear decrease with ventral attention network, and a quadric-concave with somatomotor and dorsal attention networks. In addition, the sex effect is also discovered in empathy network, which exhibits linear and quadric gender differences with frontoparietal and vision networks respectively. ToM network follows a pronounced quadric-convex (inverted U-shape) trajectory with ventral attention network. No linear and quadric trajectory is found in moral cognition network. These findings indicate that SC networks display a wide range of iFC both with the fundamental networks (e.g., somatomotor, vision) and advanced networks (e.g., attention and control) in specific developmental trajectories, which will provide a better understanding of SC neural mechanism and life-span developmental trajectories also give valuable references for SC abnormal detection and effective therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decreased ventral tegmental area CB1R signaling reduces sign-tracking and shifts cue-outcome dynamics in rat nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Sign-tracking rats show enhanced cue sensitivity before drug experience that predicts greater discrete cue-induced drug-seeking compared to goal-tracking or intermediate- rats. Cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus Accumbens (NAc) is a neurobiological signature of sign-tracking behaviors. Here, we examine a critical regulator of the dopamine system; endocannabinoids, which bind the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to control cue-evoked striatal dopamine levels. We use cell-type specific optogenetics, intra-VTA pharmacology and fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that VTA CB1R receptor signaling regulates NAc dopamine levels to control sign-tracking. We trained rats in a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task (PLA) to determine their tracking groups before testing the effect of VTA to NAc dopamine inhibition. We found this circuit is critical for mediating the vigor of the ST response. Upstream of this circuit, intra-VTA infusions of rimonabant, a CB1R inverse agonist, during PLA decrease lever and increase foodcup approach in sign-tracking rats. Using fiber photometry to measure fluorescent signals from dopamine sensor, GRABDA, we tested the effects of intra-VTA rimonabant on NAc dopamine dynamics during autoshaping. We found that intra-VTA rimonabant-induced decreases in sign-tracking behaviors are not associated with changes to phasic cue(CS)-evoked NAc dopamine activity. Instead, intra-VTA rimonabant increases NAc shell, but not core, dopamine levels during reward delivery (US). Our results suggest that CB1R signaling in the VTA influences the balance between the CS- and US-evoked dopamine responses in the NAc shell and biases behavioral responding to cues in sign-tracking rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptome profiling implicates a role for Wnt signaling during epileptogenesis in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Mesial Temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures initiating in the hippocampus. mTLE can develop after exposure to risk factors such as seizure, trauma, and infection. Within the latent period between exposure and onset of recurrent seizures, pathological remodeling events occur which are believed to contribute to epileptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms responsible for epileptogenesis in the seizure network are currently unclear. We used the mouse intrahippocampal kainate model of mTLE to investigate transcriptional dysregulation in the ipsilateral-injected epileptogenic zone (EZ), and contralateral peri-ictal zone (PIZ) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus during the first 14-days after induction of status epilepticus (SE). DG were micro-dissected 3, 7 and 14-days after SE for high-throughput RNA-sequencing. In the EZ, dynamic transcriptional dysregulation was evident over 2-weeks with early expression of genes representing cell signaling, migration and proliferation. In the PIZ, gene dysregulation was most prominent at 3-days in similar domains. Inflammatory gene groups were also prominent over the 2-week epileptogenic period in the EZ and PIZ. We uncovered that the Wnt signaling pathway was dysregulated in the EZ and PIZ at 3-days and we validated these changes via immunohistochemistry. This suggests that critical gene changes occur early after neurological insult and that canonical Wnt signaling may play a role within this latent period. These findings offer new insights into gene expression changes that occur in the hippocampal DG early after SE and may help to identify novel therapeutic targets that could prevent epileptogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Morphological evaluation of rat cerebellum following administration of nitrogen monoxide precursor and inhibitor</a></h4>

              
                In this study, the quantitative and qualitative effects of nitrogen monoxide on cerebellar histo-pathology, by increasing or decreasing in vivo production of this substance, were investigated. In this study, forty Wistar female rats (RAT) with a weight of about 200 to 250 grams and an av-erage age of eight weeks were used. Rats were divided into five groups of eight, including control groups, normal saline, L-NAME, L-Arginine, L-NAME + L-Arginine. On the third, fourth and fifth days, the injection was performed intraperitoneally and on the eighteenth day, after anesthesia with ether and then craniotomy, the brain and cerebellum of the animals were removed and After quantitative measurements including weight and volume, organs were fixed in 10% formalin and after tissue preparation steps, to prepare the slide, sections with a thickness of 5 to 6 microns were prepared from the samples and by general method such as Hematoxylin-eosin and special techniques like Mason trichrome and toluidine blue were stained and evaluated. The results of this study show that in the case of cerebellum, there is no significant difference in the quantitative weight parameter between the control groups, normal saline, L-Arg, L-NAME and L-NAME + L-Arg groups. Regarding the volume parameter, a significant increase (P <0.01) was observed in L-Arg group compared to L-NAME, L-Arg + L-NAME and normal saline groups. In microscopic qualitative parameters, the most changes in the L-Arg group were seen as follows: The granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum became slightly thickened, some of the nuclei in the granular and molecular layers became severely hyperchromatized, and Purkinje cell accumulation was seen with lymphocytic invasion. In the other groups, there were no significant changes. It is inferred from this study that L-Arginine can cause histopathological changes in cerebellar tissue by increasing NO levels in cerebellum. However, in this study, unlike other similar studies, L-NAME injection did not cause significant histopathological change.

                This ultrahigh field 7T fMRI study addressed the question of whether there exists a core network of brain areas at the service of different aspects of body perception. Participants viewed naturalistic videos of monkey and human faces, bodies, and objects along with mosaic-scrambled videos for control of low-level features. ICA-based network analysis was conducted to find body and species modulations at both the voxel and the network levels. Among the body areas, the highest species selectivity was found in the middle frontal gyrus and amygdala. Two large-scale networks were highly selective to bodies, dominated by the lateral occipital cortex and right superior temporal sulcus (STS) respectively. The right STS network showed high species selectivity, and its significant human body-induced node connectivity was focused around the extrastriate body area (EBA), STS, temporoparietal junction (TPJ), premotor cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The human body-specific network discovered here may serve as a brain-wide internal model of the human body serving as an entry point for a variety of processes relying on body descriptions as part of their more specific categorization, action, or expression recognition functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FT-GO: a multiplex fluorescent tyramide signal amplification system for histochemical analysis</a></h4>

              
                Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) is a highly sensitive method for histochemical analysis. Previously, we reported a TSA system, BT-GO, for bright-filed imaging. Here, we develop FT-GO (Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase) as a multiplex fluorescent TSA system. FT-GO involves peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of FT with hydrogen peroxide produced in enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase. We showed that FT-GO enhanced immunofluorescence signals while maintaining low background signals. Compared with indirect immunofluorescence detections, FT-GO demonstrated a more widespread distribution of monoaminergic projection systems in mouse and marmoset brains. For multiplex labeling with FT-GO, we quenched Ab-conjugated peroxidase using sodium azide. We applied FT-GO to multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization, and succeeded in labeling neocortical interneuron subtypes by coupling with immunofluorescence. FT-GO immunofluorescence further increased the detectability of an adeno-associated virus tracer. Given its simplicity and a staining with a high signal-to-noise ratio, FT-GO would provide a versatile platform for histochemical analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical surface electrical potentials are composed of multiple bandlimited frequency components, including high-gamma</a></h4>

              
                A common challenge in neuroscience is how to decompose noisy, multi-source signals measured in experiments into biophysically interpretable components. Analysis of cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs) measured using electrocorticography arrays (ECoG) typifies this problem. We hypothesized that high frequency (70-1,000 Hz) CSEPs are composed of broadband (i.e., power-law) and bandlimited components with potentially differing biophysical origins. In particular, the high-gamma band (70-150 Hz) has been shown to be highly predictive for encoding and decoding behaviors and stimuli. Despite its demonstrated importance, whether high-gamma is composed of a bandlimited signal is poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded CSEPs from rat auditory cortex and demonstrate that the evoked CSEPs are composed of multiple distinct frequency components, including high-gamma. We then show, using a novel robust regression method, that at fast timescales and on single trials during speech production, human high-gamma amplitude cannot be explained by a modulating power-law component; thus, high-gamma is band-limited. Furthermore, we show that the power-law component is less predictive of produced speech compared to the raw high-gamma amplitude. Finally, we show that the largest variance component of human ECoG signals is low-frequency and band-limited, not broadband. Together these results demonstrate that there are multiple, band-limited components of high frequency power in cortical surface electrical potentials, including the high-gamma band, which may have different biophysical origins.

                Despite continuation of some controversies, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia nowadays, has been widely believed to derive mainly from excessive {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) aggregation, that would increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce neuroinflammation, leading to neuron loss and cognitive impairment. Existing drugs on A{beta} have been ineffective or offer only temporary relief at best, due to blood-brain barrier or severe side effects. The study employed thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) as an alternative AD therapy and compared its effect with continuous hyperthermia (HT) in vivo. It established an AD mice model via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35, proving that TC-HT is much more effective in alleviating its performance decline in Y-maze and NOR test, in comparison with HT. In addition, TC-HT also exhibits a better performance in decreasing the hippocampal A{beta} and BACE1 expressions as well as the neuroinflammation markers Iba-1 and GFAP levels. Furthermore, the study finds that TC-HT can elevate more protein expressions of IDE and antioxidative enzyme SOD2 than HT. Besides, after establishment of neuroprotective mechanism, removal of TC-HT-induced ROS can further augment protection of neural cells against A{beta}. In sum, the study proves the potential of TC-HT in AD treatment, which can be put into clinical application with the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

                Adolescents undergo maturation in cognition and brain structure. Model-based (MB) control is known to increase from childhood to young adulthood, which is mediated by cognitive abilities. Here, we asked two questions unaddressed in previous developmental studies: Firstly, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Secondly, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A developmental sample (n=103, age: 12-42) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive vs. negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that grey matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. While motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in learning from positive feedback was mediated by reduced GMD in the parietal, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that efficient brain maturation, as putatively reflected in lower GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions is a key developmental step towards age-related increases in planning and value-based choice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Suboptimal phenotypic reliability impedes reproducible human neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Biomarkers of behavior and psychiatric illness for cognitive and clinical neuroscience remain out of reach. Suboptimal reliability of biological measurements, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is increasingly cited as a primary culprit for discouragingly large sample size requirements and poor reproducibility of brain-based biomarker discovery. In response, steps are being taken towards optimizing MRI reliability and increasing sample sizes, though this will not be enough. Optimizing biological measurement reliability and increasing sample sizes are necessary but insufficient steps for biomarker discovery; this focus has overlooked the ''other side of the equation'' -- the reliability of clinical and cognitive assessments -- which are often suboptimal or unassessed. Through a combination of simulation analysis and empirical studies using neuroimaging data, we demonstrate that the joint reliability of both biological and clinical/cognitive phenotypic measurements must be optimized in order to ensure biomarkers are reproducible and accurate. Even with best-case scenario high reliability neuroimaging measurements and large sample sizes, we show that suboptimal reliability of phenotypic data (i.e., clinical diagnosis, behavioral and cognitive measurements) will continue to impede meaningful biomarker discovery for the field. Improving reliability through development of novel assessments of phenotypic variation is needed, but it is not the sole solution. We emphasize the potential to improve the reliability of established phenotypic methods through aggregation across multiple raters and/or measurements, which is becoming increasingly feasible with recent innovations in data acquisition (e.g., web- and smart-phone-based administration, ecological momentary assessment, burst sampling, wearable devices, multimodal recordings). We demonstrate that such aggregation can achieve better biomarker discovery for a fraction of the cost engendered by large-scale samples. Although the current study has been motivated by ongoing developments in neuroimaging, the prioritization of reliable phenotyping will revolutionize neurobiological and clinical endeavors that are focused on brain and behavior.

                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often applied to the motor cortex to stimulate a collection of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in groups of peripheral muscles. The causal interface between TMS and MEP is the selective activation of the neurons in the motor cortex; moving the TMS 'spot' around over the motor cortex causes different MEP responses. A question of interest is whether a collection of MEP responses can be used to identify the stimulated locations on the cortex, which could potentially be used to then place the TMS coil to produce chosen sets of MEPs. In this work we leverage our previous report on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that predicted MEPs from the induced electric field, to tackle an inverse imaging task in which we start with the MEPs and estimate the stimulated regions on the motor cortex. We present and evaluate five different inverse imaging CNN architectures, both conventional and variational, in terms of several measures of reconstruction accuracy. We found that one architecture, which we denote as M2M-InvNet, consistently achieved the best performance.

                Understanding object representations requires a broad, comprehensive sampling of the objects in our visual world with dense measurements of brain activity and behavior. Here we present THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale datasets comprising functional MRI, magnetoencephalographic recordings, and 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of photographic images for up to 1,854 object concepts. THINGS-data is unique in its breadth of richly-annotated objects, allowing for testing countless hypotheses at scale while assessing the reproducibility of previous findings. Beyond the unique insights promised by each individual dataset, the multimodality of THINGS-data allows combining datasets for a much broader view into object processing than previously possible. Our analyses demonstrate the high quality of the datasets and provide five examples of hypothesis-driven and data-driven applications. THINGS-data constitutes the core release of the THINGS initiative (https://things-initiative.org) for bridging the gap between disciplines and the advancement of cognitive neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kv2 conductances are not required for C-bouton mediated enhancement of motoneuron output</a></h4>

              
                Neural motor systems have evolved complex circuits that afford animals a range 1 of behaviours essential for survival. C-bouton synapses arising from cholinergic V0C interneurons amplify motoneuron activity via muscarine type 2 receptors, thus increasing muscle contraction force. Recent work in neonatal mouse motoneurons suggests that delayed rectifier currents carried by post-synaptically clustered KV2.1 channels are crucial to C-bouton amplification. Here we use a motoneuron conditional KV2.1 knockout to show that while KV2.1 modulates maximal firing in neonatal mice, its removal minimally affects either mature motoneuron firing or the enhanced firing rates in response to exogenously applied muscarine. In keeping with this, pharmacological blockade of KV2 currents has minimal electrophysiological effects on mature motoneurons. Furthermore, amplification of electromyography activity during high force tasks was unchanged following KV2.1 deletion. We next show that KV2.2 is also expressed by spinal motoneurons and colocalises with KV2.1 opposite C-boutons. We suggest that the primary function of KV2 proteins -- KV2.1 and KV2.2 -- is non-conducting in motoneurons, and that KV2.2 can function in the absence of KV2.1, perhaps to ensure the integrity of the synapse.

                Traumatic brain injury-induced axonal degeneration leads to acute and chronic neuropsychiatric impairment, neuronal death, and accelerated neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Thus, there is much interest in developing treatments that protect axons after injury. For this endeavor, extended comprehensive evaluation of axonal integrity in experimental systems is required to evaluate the efficacy of putative interventions in preclinical models. However, traditional histological tissue proccessing techniques are logistically prohibitive for assessments of long-term pathology. Here, we report a new method of longitudinally monitoring the functional activity of thalamocortical axons before and after injury in vivo in the same animal over an extended period of time. Specifically, we expressed an axonal-targeting genetically-encoded calcium indicator in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and then recorded axonal activity patterns in the visual cortex in response to visual stimulation. We demonstrate the utility of this method for assessing in vivo aberrant axonal activity patterns after traumatic brain injury, as well as for evaluating the therapuetic efficacy of the neuroprotective P7C3-A20 pharmacologic agent in vivo. We found that P7C3-A20 treatment minimized most, but not all, of the pathological changes in axonal activity patterns after traumatic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural substrates of body ownership and agency during voluntary movement</a></h4>

              
                Body ownership and the sense of agency are two central aspects of bodily self-consciousness. While multiple neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of body ownership and agency in isolation, few have investigated their relationship during voluntary movement when such experiences naturally combine. By eliciting the moving rubber hand illusion with active or passive finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated activations reflecting the sense of body ownership and agency, respectively, as well as their interaction, and assessed their overlap and anatomical segregation. We found that perceived hand ownership was associated with activity in premotor, posterior parietal and cerebellar regions whereas the sense of agency over the hand's movements was related to activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and superior temporal cortex. Moreover, one section of the dorsal premotor cortex showed overlapping activity for ownership and agency, and somatosensory cortical activity reflected the interaction of ownership and agency with higher activity when both agency and ownership was experienced. We further found that activations previously attributed to agency in the left insular cortex and right temporoparietal junction reflected the synchrony or asynchrony of the visuo-proprioceptive stimuli rather than agency. Collectively, these results identify the neural bases of agency and ownership during voluntary movement. Although the neural representations of these two experiences are largely distinct, there are functional neuroanatomical overlap and interactions during their combination, which has bearing on theories on bodily self-consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain fingerprint is based on the aperiodic, scale-free, neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The possibility to identify subjects from their brain activity was met enthusiastically, as it bears the possibility to individualize brain analyses. However, the nature of the processes generating subject-specific features remains unknown, as the literature does not point to specific mechanisms. In particular, most of the current literature uses techniques that are based on the assumption of stationarity (e.g. Pearson's correlation), which do not hypothesize any mechanisms, and crashes against a large body of literature showing the complex, highly non-linear nature of brain activity. In this paper, we hypothesize that intermittent moments when large, non-linear perturbations spread across the brain (defined as neuronal avalanches in the context of critical dynamics) are the ones that carry subject-specific information, and that contribute the most to identifiability. To test this hypothesis, we apply the recently-developed avalanche transition matrix (ATM) to source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic data, as to characterize subject-speficic fast dynamics. Then, we perform identifiability analysis based on the ATMs, and compared the performance to more classical ways of estimating large-scale connections (which assume stationareity). We demonstrate that selecting the moments and places where neuronal avalanches spread improves identifiability (p<0.0001, permutation testing), despite the fact that most ot the data (i.e. the linear part) are discarded. Our results show that the non-linear part of the brain signals carries most of the subject-specific information, shading light on the nature of the processes that underlie subject-identifiability. Borrowing from statistical mechanics, a solid branch of physics, we provide a principled way to link emergent large-scale personalized activations to non-observable, microscopic processes.

                Like many other animals, insects are capable of returning to previously visited locations using path integration. Recently, Drosophila has been added to the list of insects thought capable of this navigational memory. Existing experimental evidence, however, has a potential confound. Here we show that pheromones deposited at the site of reward might enable flies to find previously rewarding locations even without memory. Thus, we designed an experiment to determine if flies can use path integration memory despite potential pheromonal cues by displacing the flies shortly after an optogenetic reward. We found that rewarded flies returned to the location predicted by a memory-based model. Several analyses are consistent with path integration as the mechanism by which flies returned to the reward. We conclude that while pheromones may often be important in fly navigation and must be carefully controlled in future experiments, Drosophila may indeed be capable of performing path integration.

                There is increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in psychiatric disorders. In common with other serotonergic psychedelics, psilocybin is thought to act via the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Serotonin is the endogenous ligand of 5-HTR. In rodents, the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and psilocybin, induce a characteristic head twitch response (HTR), which is correlated with the human psychedelic trip in intensity and duration. We examined the role of other serotonergic receptors and the trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in modulating HTR induced by 5-HTP and psilocybin. Male C57BL/6J mice (11 weeks old, ~30g) were administered 5-HTP, 50-250 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) or 200 mg/kg i.p. after pretreatment with 5-HT/TAAR1 receptor modulators. Psilocybin was administered at 0.1-51.2 mg/kg i.p. or at 4.4 mg/kg i.p. preceded by 5-HT/TAAR1 receptor modulators. HTR was assessed in a custom-built magnetometer. 5-HTP and psilocybin induced a dose dependent increase in the frequency of HTR over 20 minutes with attenuation by the 5-HT2AR antagonist, M100907 (volanserin), and the 5-HT1AR agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. The 5-HT2CR antagonist, RS102221, enhanced HTR at lower doses but reduced it at higher doses for 5-HTP and psilocybin. The TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB, reduced 5-HTP- but not psilocybin-induced HTR. We have confirmed the key role of 5-HT2AR in HTR and have demonstrated an effect of 5-HT1AR and a bimodal contribution of 5-HT2CR as well as a role of TAAR1 in modulating HTR induced by 5-HTP. Compounds that modulate HTR induced by psychedelics have a potentially important role in the emerging therapeutic use of these compounds.

                Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions each year. Most PD cases (90%) are sporadic, resulting from the age-dependent accumulation of pathogenic effects. One key pathological hallmark of PD progression is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (-syn), which has been shown to negatively affect neuronal function and viability. Here, using 3- and 6-month-old Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice over expressing human -syn (PD model), we show that loss of NRF2 increases markers of ferroptosis across PD-relevant brain regions Increased ferroptosis was associated with an age- and genotype-dependent increase in -syn pathology and behavioral deficits. Finally, we demonstrate that -syn over expression sensitizes neuronal cells and ex vivo brain slices to ferroptosis induction, which may be due to -syn suppression of NRF2 at the protein level. Altogether, these results indicate that NRF2 is a critical anti-ferroptotic mediator of neuronal survival, and that the vicious cycle of -syn over expression and NRF2 suppression, leading to enhanced neuronal ferroptotic cell death, could represent a targetable and currently untapped means of preventing PD onset and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing visual cortex of children and adults reveals a late-stage change in the architecture of V1</a></h4>

              
                Adult visual ability differs markedly with stimulus polar angle: relative to the point of fixation, visual performance is best for stimuli to the left or right, intermediate for stimuli below, and poorest for stimuli above. These polar angle asymmetries in performance are paralleled by cortical asymmetries in the visual field representation in primary visual cortex (V1). Whereas children, like adults, show better performance for stimuli along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, they show no performance difference for stimuli above vs below fixation. Is the difference in visual performance between children and adults matched by a difference in the amount of V1 surface area representing these regions? We used fMRI to measure the distribution of the cortical surface representing the visual field in children and adults. Two properties of the V1, V2, and V3 maps were mature in children -overall map surface area and variation in surface area as a function of eccentricity. Further, like adults, children had much greater V1 surface area representing the horizontal than vertical meridian. However, unlike adults, children did not have greater V1 surface area for the lower than upper vertical meridian. These data indicate a late-stage change in the architecture of V1 that may drive the emergence of a visual performance asymmetry along the vertical meridian by adulthood.

                Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) plays an essential role in neuronal activities through interaction with various proteins involved in signaling at membranes. However, the distribution pattern of PI(4,5)P2 and the co-clustering with these proteins on the neuronal cell membranes remain elusive at the electron microscopic level. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the nanoscale distribution of PI(4,5)P2 on the neuronal cell membranes by SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling with cryo-fixed mouse cerebellum. We demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 makes clusters with a mean size of ~ 1,000 nm2 and these clusters show preferential accumulation in specific membrane compartments depending on cell types. Purkinje cell (PC) spines and granule cell (GC) presynaptic active zones are particularly rich in the PI(4,5)P2 clusters. Furthermore, these clusters are extensively associated with clusters of CaV2.1 and GIRK3 throughout different membrane compartments of PCs, GCs, and molecular layer interneurons. In contrast, these clusters showed compartment-specific association with mGluR1 in PC spines. These results suggest that visualization of the nanoscale PI(4,5)P2 distribution may provide insight into the physiological functions of PI(4,5)P2 in neurons.

                During sleep, recently acquired episodic memories (i.e., autobiographical memories for specific events) are strengthened and transformed, a process termed consolidation. These memories are contextual in nature, with details of specific features interwoven with more general properties such as the time and place of the event. In this study, we hypothesized that the context in which a memory is embedded would guide the process of consolidation during sleep. To test this idea, we employed a spatial memory task and considered changes in memory over a 10-hour period including either sleep or wake. In both conditions, participants (N = 62) formed stories that contextually bound four objects together, and then encoded the on-screen spatial position of all objects. Results showed that the changes in memory over the sleep period were correlated among contextually linked objects, whereas no such effect was identified for the wake group. These results suggest that contexts binding different memories together play an active role in consolidation during sleep.

	<p>Poor motor function or physical performance is a predictor of cognitive decline. Additionally, slow gait speed is associated with poor cognitive performance, with gait disturbances being a risk factor for dementia. Parallel declines in muscular and cognitive performance (resulting in cognitive frailty) might be driven primarily by muscle deterioration, but bidirectional pathways involving muscle&amp;amp;ndash;brain crosstalk through the central and peripheral nervous systems are likely to exist. Following screening, early-stage parallel declines may be manageable and modifiable through simple interventions. Gait&amp;amp;ndash;brain relationships in dementia and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood; therefore, the current authors critically reviewed the literature on the gait&amp;amp;ndash;brain relationship and the underlying mechanisms and the feasibility/accuracy of assessment tools in order to identify research gaps. The authors suggest that dual-task gait is involved in concurrent cognitive and motor activities, reflecting how the brain allocates resources when gait is challenged by an additional task and that poor performance on dual-task gait is a predictor of dementia onset. Thus, tools or protocols that allow the identification of subtle disease- or disorder-related changes in gait are highly desirable to improve diagnosis. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive, cost-effective, safe, simple, portable, and non-motion-sensitive neuroimaging technique, widely used in studies of clinical populations such as people suffering from Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, depression, and other chronic neurological disorders. If fNIRS can help researchers to better understand gait disturbance, then fNIRS could form the basis of a cost-effective means of identifying people at risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. The major research gap identified in this review relates to the role of the central/peripheral nervous system when performing dual tasks.</p>

	<p>After the command and control information of the command and control cabin is displayed in the form of mixed reality, the large amount of real-time information and static information contained in it will form a dynamic situation that changes all the time. This brings a great burden to the system operator&#039;s cognition, decision-making and operation. In order to solve this problem, this paper studies the three-dimensional spatial layout of holographic command cabin information display in a mixed reality environment. A total of 15 people participated in the experiment, of which 10 were the subjects of the experiment and 5 were the staff of the auxiliary experiment. Ten subjects used the HoloLens 2 generation to conduct visual characteristics and cognitive load experiments and collected and analyzed the subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; task completion time, error rate, eye movement and EEG and subjective evaluation data. Through the analysis of experimental data, the laws of visual and cognitive features of three-dimensional space in a mixed reality environment can be obtained. This paper systematically explores the effects of three key attributes: depth distance, information layer number and target relative position depth distance of information distribution in a 3D space, on visual search performance and on cognitive load. The experimental results showed that the optimal depth distance range for information display in the mixed reality environment is: the best depth distance for operation interactions (0.6 m~1.0 m), the best depth distance for accurate identification (2.4 m~2.8 m) and the overall situational awareness best-in-class depth distance (3.4 m~3.6 m). Under a certain angle of view, the number of information layers in the space is as small as possible, and the number of information layers should not exceed five at most. The relative position depth distance between the information layers in space ranges from 0.2 m to 0.35 m. Based on this theory, information layout in a 3D space can achieve a faster and more accurate visual search in a mixed reality environment and effectively reduce the cognitive load.</p>

	<p>The activity of excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits in the motor cortex can be probed and modified by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS), noninvasively. At present, not only has a consensus regarding the interhemispheric effect of high frequency rTMS not been reached, but the attributes of these TMS-related circuits are also poorly understood. To address this question comprehensively, we integrated a single- and paired-pulse TMS evaluation with excitatory 20-Hz rTMS intervention in order to probe the interhemispheric effect on the intracortical circuits by high-frequency rTMS. In the rest state, after 20-Hz rTMS, a significant increase of single-pulse MEP and paired-pulse intracortical facilitation (ICF) in the non-stimulated hemisphere was observed with good test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. Intracortical inhibition (measured by the cortical silent period) in the unstimulated hemisphere also increased after rTMS. No significant time&amp;amp;ndash;course change was observed in the sham-rTMS group. The results provide the evidence that 20-Hz rTMS induced a reliable interhemispheric facilitatory effect. Findings from the present study suggest that the glutamatergic facilitatory system and the GABAergic inhibitory system may vary synchronously.</p>

	<p>Background. Few studies have evaluated cognitive functioning and mental health in children and adolescents who contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated the prevalence and association of neuropsychological difficulties, psychological symptoms, and self-reported long-COVID complaints in a sample of adolescents. Methods. Thirty-one adolescents infected by COVID-19 within 3&amp;amp;ndash;6 months prior to the assessment were included. Neuropsychological difficulties, psychological symptoms, and self-reported long-COVID complaints were evaluated using a checklist and a battery of multiple standardized measures, using a telehealth procedure. Symptoms during the infection were also detected. Results. We included 31 adolescents (23 girls, 8 boys; mean age 14.1, SD = 2). We found borderline scores in 32.3% and 45.2% of our sample for phonemic and category fluency, respectively. A high percentage of participants showed symptoms of depression (80.6%) and anxiety (61.3%). Fifty-eight percent reported at least one long-COVID symptom. The most common symptoms were headache and attention problems (58%). Subjects presenting numbness/weakness, fatigue, brain fog, or attention problems had higher scores in depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Conclusion. This is a pilot study limited by the lack of control group. However, we found that cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms were very common among adolescents recovered from COVID-19.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Continuous Tracking of Task Parameters Tunes Reaching Control Online</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A hallmark of human reaching movements is that they are appropriately tuned to the task goal and to the environmental context. This was demonstrated by the way humans flexibly respond to mechanical and visual perturbations that happen during movement. Furthermore, it was previously showed that the properties of goal-directed control can change within a movement, following abrupt changes in the goal structure. Such online adjustment was characterized by a modulation of feedback gains following switches in target shape. However, it remains unknown whether the underlying mechanism merely switches between prespecified policies, or whether it results from continuous and potentially dynamic adjustments. Here, we address this question by investigating participants&rsquo; feedback control strategies in presence of various changes in target width during reaching. More specifically, we studied whether the feedback responses to mechanical perturbations were sensitive to the rate of change in target width, which would be inconsistent with the hypothesis of a single, discrete switch. Based on movement kinematics and surface EMG data, we observed a modulation of feedback response clearly dependent on dynamical changes in target width. Together, our results demonstrate a continuous and online transformation of task-related parameters into suitable control policies.</p>

                Meigs’s syndrome is characterized by a triad of ovarian fibroma, ascites, and pleural effusion which can be managed surgically. Pleural effusion and ascites are usually transudative. Ovarian fibroma is an uncommon tumor. We herein report a case of Meigs’s syndrome in a 61-year-old woman who presented with complaints of abdominal pain for two-three months along with decreased appetite and constipation. On examination, there was decreased air entry in the right side of the chest, generalized abdominal distention, and a firm irregular mass was felt which was mobile and extending from upper border of symphysis pubis to just above the umbilicus on abdominal palpation. Chest X ray showed right sided pleural effusion, ultrasonogram (USG) abdominal and pelvis showed gross ascites, and a very large complex right ovarian cyst was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She underwent staging laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omental resection for biopsy. Biopsy showed right ovarian fibroma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determinants of mortality risk among Indonesian patients with COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mortality risk of the novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) remains a global concern. Particularly in Indonesia, patients aged 18–59 years have a high risk of death due to COVID-19. In this study, we analysed the determinants of mortality risk among patients with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from the Indonesian COVID-19 dashboard, tracking COVID-19 cases from April 2020 to May 2021 was performed. Data of 22,314 patients with COVID-19 aged 18–59 years were analysed using descriptive analysis, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Factors associated with confirmed mortality risk among patients aged 18–59 years with COVID-19 included increasing age (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.07–1.09), hospitalised and on ventilator support (AOR = 130.75; 95% CI = 69.03–247.63), having severe disease (AOR = 15.24; 95% CI = 11.51–20.17), and travelling history (AOR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.13–1.63). Conclusions: These findings confirmed that the increasing risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with increasing age, ventilator support during hospitalisation, developing severe disease, and having a travelling history. This suggests that curative strategies should be strengthened with a focus on improving clinical governance by prioritising patients with the above variables.

                Background: Medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians (MAPPs) have unique value to pharmaceutical companies due to their accountability for activities that benefit regulators, payors, prescribers and patients. This study assessed whether MAPPs’ specialist training and education in pharmaceutical medicine could account for this level of value by determining whether there was significant variation in education and training between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders of pharmaceutical companies. Methods: A systematic search of LinkedIn profiles from the 10 pharmaceutical companies by revenue was conducted between June and October 2021. Job title and type and year of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications were extracted. A one-sided Mann-Whitney test assessed for differences in the total number of qualifications between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders involved in medical affairs using MAPPs as the reference group. Other internal stakeholders included medical affairs pharmacists (MAPharm), other medical affairs professionals (MAOth), and market access (MAcc), commercial (COmm) and sales professionals. Sub-group analysis determined differences in undergraduate and postgraduate education. Results: In total, 524 profiles were included. Compared to all other internal stakeholders, MAPPs had a significantly higher number of undergraduate (p < 0.001) and postgraduate (MAPharm, p = 0.003; MAOth, p = 0.004; MAcc, COmm and Sales, p < 0.001) qualifications. Additionally, MAPPs had a significantly longer time to industry than other internal stakeholders apart from MAPharm. Of those with clinical qualifications, MAPPs were almost twice as likely to have business qualifications. Conclusions: Of all internal stakeholders, MAPPs had the highest number of qualifications and the best match between expertise and the contextual demands of decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies in the UK can use these findings to clarify role boundaries and decision-making power based on the nature and level of expertise of each internal stakeholder.

                <p>by Hélène Cecilia, Roosmarie Vriens, Paul J. Wichgers Schreur, Mariken M. de Wit, Raphaëlle Métras, Pauline Ezanno, Quirine A. ten Bosch</p>

Quantifying the variation of pathogens’ life history traits in multiple host systems is crucial to understand their transmission dynamics. It is particularly important for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), which are prone to infecting several species of vertebrate hosts. Here, we focus on how host-pathogen interactions determine the ability of host species to transmit a virus to susceptible vectors upon a potentially infectious contact. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral, vector-borne, zoonotic disease, chosen as a case study. The relative contributions of livestock species to RVFV transmission has not been previously quantified. To estimate their potential to transmit the virus over the course of their infection, we 1) fitted a within-host model to viral RNA and infectious virus measures, obtained daily from infected lambs, calves, and young goats, 2) estimated the relationship between vertebrate host infectious titers and probability to infect mosquitoes, and 3) estimated the net infectiousness of each host species over the duration of their infectious periods, taking into account different survival outcomes for lambs. Our results indicate that the efficiency of viral replication, along with the lifespan of infectious particles, could be sources of heterogeneity between hosts. Given available data on RVFV competent vectors, we found that, for similar infectious titers, infection rates in the <i>Aedes</i> genus were on average higher than in the <i>Culex</i> genus. Consequently, for <i>Aedes</i>-mediated infections, we estimated the net infectiousness of lambs to be 2.93 (median) and 3.65 times higher than that of calves and goats, respectively. In lambs, we estimated the overall infectiousness to be 1.93 times higher in individuals which eventually died from the infection than in those recovering. Beyond infectiousness, the relative contributions of host species to transmission depend on local ecological factors, including relative abundances and vector host-feeding preferences. Quantifying these contributions will ultimately help design efficient, targeted, surveillance and vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulations of tumor growth and response to immunotherapy by coupling a spatial agent-based model with a whole-patient quantitative systems pharmacology model</a></h4>

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models and spatial agent-based models (ABM) are powerful and efficient approaches for the analysis of biological systems and for clinical applications. Although QSP models are becoming essential in discovering predictive biomarkers and developing combination therapies through <i>in silico</i> virtual trials, they are inadequate to capture the spatial heterogeneity and randomness that characterize complex biological systems, and specifically the tumor microenvironment. Here, we extend our recently developed spatial QSP (spQSP) model to analyze tumor growth dynamics and its response to immunotherapy at different spatio-temporal scales. In the model, the tumor spatial dynamics is governed by the ABM, coupled to the QSP model, which includes the following compartments: central (blood system), tumor, tumor-draining lymph node, and peripheral (the rest of the organs and tissues). A dynamic recruitment of T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) from the QSP central compartment has been implemented as a function of the spatial distribution of cancer cells. The proposed QSP-ABM coupling methodology enables the spQSP model to perform as a coarse-grained model at the whole-tumor scale and as an agent-based model at the regions of interest (ROIs) scale. Thus, we exploit the spQSP model potential to characterize tumor growth, identify T cell hotspots, and perform qualitative and quantitative descriptions of cell density profiles at the invasive front of the tumor. Additionally, we analyze the effects of immunotherapy at both whole-tumor and ROI scales under different tumor growth and immune response conditions. A digital pathology computational analysis of triple-negative breast cancer specimens is used as a guide for modeling the immuno-architecture of the invasive front.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty quantification in cerebral circulation simulations focusing on the collateral flow: Surrogate model approach with machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Changyoung Yuhn, Marie Oshima, Yan Chen, Motoharu Hayakawa, Shigeki Yamada</p>

Collateral circulation in the circle of Willis (CoW), closely associated with disease mechanisms and treatment outcomes, can be effectively investigated using one-dimensional–zero-dimensional hemodynamic simulations. As the entire cardiovascular system is considered in the simulation, it captures the systemic effects of local arterial changes, thus reproducing collateral circulation that reflects biological phenomena. The simulation facilitates rapid assessment of clinically relevant hemodynamic quantities under patient-specific conditions by incorporating clinical data. During patient-specific simulations, the impact of clinical data uncertainty on the simulated quantities should be quantified to obtain reliable results. However, as uncertainty quantification (UQ) is time-consuming and computationally expensive, its implementation in time-sensitive clinical applications is considered impractical. Therefore, we constructed a surrogate model based on machine learning using simulation data. The model accurately predicts the flow rate and pressure in the CoW in a few milliseconds. This reduced computation time enables the UQ execution with 100 000 predictions in a few minutes on a single CPU core and in less than a minute on a GPU. We performed UQ to predict the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion (CH), a life-threatening condition that can occur after carotid artery stenosis surgery if collateral circulation fails to function appropriately. We predicted the statistics of the postoperative flow rate increase in the CoW, which is a measure of CH, considering the uncertainties of arterial diameters, stenosis parameters, and flow rates measured using the patients’ clinical data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the impact of each uncertain parameter on the flow rate increase. Results indicated that CH occurred when two conditions were satisfied simultaneously: severe stenosis and when arteries of small diameter serve as the collateral pathway to the cerebral artery on the stenosis side. These findings elucidate the biological aspects of cerebral circulation in terms of the relationship between collateral flow and CH.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sweet sensors support stressed cell survival</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel J. Himmel, Richard Benton</p>

Gustatory receptors (Grs) are well known for their functions in sensory neurons in detecting food and toxins. An intriguing new study in PLOS Biology provides evidence for a role for Grs in Drosophila epithelia in protecting stressed cells from proteotoxicity.

Gustatory receptors on sensory neurons have a well established role in chemosensation. This Primer explores the implications of a PLOS Biology study revealing that a gustatory receptor gene cluster has an unexpected role in regulating cell survival during proteotoxic stress.

                The zebrafish is an important model in systems neuroscience but viral tools to dissect the structure and function of neuronal circuitry are not established. We developed methods for efficient gene transfer and retrograde tracing in adult and larval zebrafish by herpes simplex viruses (HSV1). HSV1 was combined with the Gal4/UAS system to target cell types with high spatial, temporal, and molecular specificity. We also established methods for efficient transneuronal tracing by modified rabies viruses in zebrafish. We demonstrate that HSV1 and rabies viruses can be used to visualize and manipulate genetically or anatomically identified neurons within and across different brain areas of adult and larval zebrafish. An expandable library of viruses is provided to express fluorescent proteins, calcium indicators, optogenetic probes, toxins and other molecular tools. This toolbox creates new opportunities to interrogate neuronal circuits in zebrafish through combinations of genetic and viral approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BIRC6 modifies risk of invasive bacterial infection in Kenyan children</a></h4>

              
                Invasive bacterial disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in African children. Despite being caused by diverse pathogens, children with sepsis are clinically indistinguishable from one another. In spite of this, most genetic susceptibility loci for invasive infection that have been discovered to date are pathogen specific and are not therefore suggestive of a shared genetic architecture of bacterial sepsis. Here we utilise probabilistic diagnostic models to identify children with a high probability of invasive bacterial disease among critically unwell Kenyan children with P. falciparum parasitaemia. We construct a joint dataset including 1,445 bacteraemia cases and 1,143 severe malaria cases, and population controls, among critically unwell Kenyan children that have previously been genotyped for human genetic variation. Using these data we perform a cross-trait genome-wide association study of invasive bacterial infection, weighting cases according to their probability of bacterial disease. In doing so we identify and validate a novel risk locus for invasive infection secondary to multiple bacterial pathogens, that has no apparent effect on malaria risk. The locus identified modifies splicing of BIRC6 in stimulated monocytes, implicating regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the pathogenesis of sepsis in Kenyan children.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tracking receptor motions at the plasma membrane reveals distinct effects of ligands on CCR5 dynamics depending on its dimerization status</a></h4>

              
                G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are present at the cell surface in different conformational and oligomeric states. However, how these states impact GPCRs biological function and therapeutic targeting remains incompletely known. Here, we investigated this issue in living cells for the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a major receptor in inflammation and the principal entry co-receptor for Human Immunodeficiency Viruses type 1 (HIV-1). We used TIRF microscopy and a statistical method to track and classify the motion of different receptor subpopulations. We showed a diversity of ligand-free forms of CCR5 at the cell surface constituted of various oligomeric states and exhibiting transient Brownian and restricted motions. These forms were stabilized differently by distinct ligands. In particular, agonist stimulation restricted the mobility of CCR5 and led to its clustering, a feature depending on β-arrestin, while inverse agonist stimulation exhibited the opposite effect. These results suggest a link between receptor activation and immobilization. Applied to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp120, our quantitative analysis revealed agonist-like properties of gp120s. Distinct gp120s influenced CCR5 dynamics differently, suggesting that they stabilize different CCR5 conformations. Then, using a dimerization-compromized mutant, we showed that dimerization (i) impacts CCR5 precoupling to G proteins, (ii) is a pre-requisite for the immobilization and clustering of receptors upon activation, and (iii) regulates receptor endocytosis, thereby impacting the fate of activated receptors. This study demonstrates that tracking the dynamic behavior of a GPCR is an efficient way to link GPCR conformations to their functions, therefore improving the development of drugs targeting specific receptor conformations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Posttranslational modifications of the DUX4 protein impact toxic function</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by abnormal de-repression of the transcription factor DUX4, which is toxic to muscle in vitro and in vivo. While the transcriptional targets of DUX4 are known, the regulation of DUX4 protein and the molecular consequences of this regulation are unclear. Here, we used in vitro models of FSHD to identify and characterize DUX4 posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and their impact on the toxic function of DUX4. Methods: DUX4 protein was immunoprecipitated and mass spectrometry performed to identify PTMs. We then extensively characterized DUX4 PTMs and potential enzyme modifiers using mutagenesis, proteomics and biochemical assays in human cell lines and human myoblast cell lines. Results: Our in vitro screen of DUX4 PTM mutants identified arginine methyl-null and serine/threonine phosphomimetic mutants that protected cells against DUX4-mediated toxicity and reduced the ability of DUX4 to transactivate downstream gene targets, including FSHD biomarkers. Using additional proteomics and biochemical approaches, we identified protein kinase A (PKA) and a protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT1) as components of the DUX4 complex. Importantly, over-expression of PRKACA, a catalytic subunit of the PKA holoenzyme, mitigated DUX4 toxicity, while pharmacologic inhibition of PRMT1 protected human myoblasts from DUX4-mediated apoptosis. Interpretation: These results demonstrate that DUX4 is regulated by PTMs and that DUX4 PTMs, or associated modifying enzymes, may be druggable targets for FSHD therapy.

                Alcohol use disorder is a major public health concern in the United States. Recent work has suggested a link between chronic alcohol consumption and the development of tauopathy disorders, such as Alzheimers Disease and Frontal-Temporal Dementia. However, relatively little work has investigated changes in neural circuitry involved in both tauopathy disorders and alcohol use disorder. The locus coeruleus (LC) is the major noradrenergic nuclei in the brain and is one of the earliest sites to be affected by tau lesions. The LC is also implicated in the rewarding effects of ethanol and alcohol withdrawal. In this study we assessed effects of long-term ethanol consumption and tauopathy on the physiology of LC neurons. Male and female P301S mice, a humanized transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, underwent 16 weeks of intermittent access to 20% ethanol from 3 to 7 months of age. We observed higher total alcohol consumption in female mice regardless of genotype. Male P301S mice consumed more ethanol and had a greater preference for ethanol than WT males. At the end of the drinking study, LC function was assessed using ex vivo whole cell electrophysiology. We found significant changes in excitatory inputs to the LC due to both ethanol and genotype. We found significantly increased excitability of the LC due to ethanol with greater effects in female P301S mice than WT. Our study identifies significant changes in the LC due to interactions between tauopathy and long-term ethanol use. These findings could have important implications regarding LC activity and changes in behavior due to both ethanol and tauopathy related dementia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structure and dynamics that specialize neurons for high-frequency coincidence detection in the barn owl nucleus laminaris</a></h4>

              
                A principal cue for sound source localization is the difference in arrival times of sounds at an animal's two ears (interaural time difference, ITD). Neurons that process ITDs are specialized to compare the timing of inputs with submillisecond precision. In the barn owl, ITD processing begins in the nucleus laminaris (NL) region of the auditory brainstem. Remarkably, NL neurons are sensitive to ITDs in high-frequency sounds (kilohertz-range). This contrasts with ITD-based sound localization in analogous regions in mammals where ITD-sensitivity is typically restricted to lower-frequency sounds. Guided by previous experiments and modeling studies of tone-evoked responses of NL neurons, we propose NL neurons achieve high-frequency ITD sensitivity if they respond selectively to the small-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations in their inputs, and remain relatively non-responsive to mean input level. We use a biophysically-based model to study the effects of soma-axon coupling on dynamics and function in NL neurons. First, we show that electrical separation of the soma from the axon region in the neuron enhances high-frequency ITD sensitivity. This soma-axon coupling configuration promotes linear subthreshold dynamics and rapid spike initiation, making the model more responsive to input fluctuations, rather than mean input level. Second, we provide new evidence for the essential role of phasic dynamics for high-frequency neural coincidence detection. Transforming our model to the phasic firing mode further tunes the model to respond selectively to the fluctuating inputs that carry ITD information. Similar structural and dynamical mechanisms specialize mammalian auditory brainstem neurons for ITD-sensitivity, thus our work identifies common principles of ITD-processing and neural coincidence detection across species and for sounds at widely-different frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible selection of task-relevant features through across-area population gating</a></h4>

              
                Brains can gracefully weed out irrelevant stimuli to guide behavior. This feat is believed to rely on a progressive selection of task-relevant stimuli across the cortical hierarchy, but the specific across-area interactions enabling stimulus selection are still unclear. Here, we propose that population gating, occurring within A1 but controlled by top-down inputs from mPFC, can support across-area stimulus selection. Examining single-unit activity recorded while rats performed an auditory context-dependent task, we found that A1 encoded relevant and irrelevant stimuli along a common dimension of its neural space. Yet, the relevant stimulus encoding was enhanced along an extra dimension. In turn, mPFC encoded only the stimulus relevant to the ongoing context. To identify candidate mechanisms for stimulus selection within A1, we reverse-engineered low-rank RNNs trained on a similar task. Our analyses predicted that two context-modulated neural populations gated their preferred stimulus in opposite contexts, which we confirmed in further analyses of A1. We finally integrated our within-area observations in a two-region RNN and proposed a novel mechanism for flexible across-area communication through fixed connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A 3D bioengineered neural tissue model generated from patient-derived iPSCs develops Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Background Current models to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) include cell cultures and animal models. Human diseases, however, are often poorly reproduced in animal models. Developing techniques to differentiate human brain cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides a novel approach to studying AD. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures to model AD are represented by organoids, neurospheroids, and scaffold-based cultures. Methods We developed a 3D bioengineered model of iPSC-derived neural tissue that combines a porous scaffold composed of silk fibroin protein with an intercalated collagen hydrogel to support the growth of neurons and glial cells into complex and functional networks. This biomaterial scaffold, designed to match the mechanical properties of brain tissue, can support 3D neural cultures for an extended time without necrosis, a fundamental requisite for aging studies. We have optimized our protocol by seeding neural precursor cells (NPCs) into these scaffolds. Having NPCs stocks derived from multiple subjects allows synchronization of their differentiation and minimizes experimental variability. Cultures were generated from iPSC lines obtained from two subjects carrying the familial AD (FAD) APP London mutation, two well-studied control lines, and an isogenic control. Cultures were analyzed at 2 and 4.5 months. Results An elevated A{beta}42/40 ratio was detected in FAD cultures at both time points, as previously reported in 2D cultures derived from the same FAD lines. Extracellular A{beta}42 deposition and enhanced neuronal excitability were observed in FAD culture at 4.5 months. Notably, neuronal hyperexcitability has been described in AD patients early in the disease. Transcriptomic analysis revealed deregulation of multiple gene sets in FAD samples. Such alterations were similar to those observed in human AD brains in a large study that performed a co-expression meta-analysis of harmonized data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) across three independent cohorts. Conclusions Our 3D tissue model supports the differentiation of healthy iPSC-derived cultures in a porous silk-collagen composite sponge with an optically clear central region. This design facilitates nutrient delivery to meet the metabolic demand of long-term cultures. These data provide evidence that our bioengineered model from patient-derived FAD iPSCs develops AD-related phenotypes, including AD transcriptomic features. Thus, it can represent a valuable model for studying AD-related pathomechanisms.

                Correcting head motion artifacts in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) scans is particularly challenging due to the dramatic changes in image contrast at different gradient strengths and directions. Head motion correction is typically performed using a Gaussian Process model implemented in FSL's Eddy. Recently, the 3dSHORE-based SHORELine method was introduced to correct any dMRI sequence that has more than one shell. Here we perform a comprehensive evaluation of both methods on realistic simulations of a software fiber phantom that provides known ground-truth head motion. We demonstrate that both methods perform remarkably well, but that performance can be impacted by sampling scheme, the pervasiveness of head motion, and the denoising strategy applied before head motion correction. Our study also provides an open and fully-reproducible workflow that could be used to accelerate evaluation studies of other dMRI processing methods in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus duration encoding occurs early in the moth olfactory pathway</a></h4>

              
                Flying insects encounter turbulent environments, where chemotaxis along a concentration gradient makes little sense. Detection of the onset and offset of discrete odor pulses is then expected to become crucial for navigation, but it is not well understood how the olfactory system encodes the offset of the odor pulse. Previous works indicated that the duration of a male moth olfactory receptor neuron's (ORN) spike firing response to pheromone stimuli greatly exceeds the pulse duration. However, these works were based on imprecise odor delivery systems. We built an odor delivery system capable of delivering much sharper pheromone stimuli. The stimuli evoked ORN firing responses that faithfully tracked the stimulus duration, provided the stimulus lasted at least 200 ms. A transient inhibition marked the termination of such stimuli. Shorter stimuli produced a firing response exceeding the stimulus duration. The response shapes could be explained by adaptation of the ORN on only two time scales. With simulations, we showed that the observed limits in stimulus offset detection propagate to the antennal lobe and are likely to be behaviorally significant. Our results increase the understanding of the mechanisms necessary for male moths to navigate through pheromone plumes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical, muscular, and kinetic activity underpinning attentional focus strategies during visuomotor control</a></h4>

              
                Focusing internally on movement control or bodily sensations is frequently shown to disrupt the effectiveness and efficiency of motor control when compared to focusing externally on the outcome of movement. Whilst the behavioural consequences of these attentional strategies are well documented, it is unclear how they are explained at the corticomuscular level. The aim of the present study was to investigate how attentional focus strategies affect kinetic, cortical, muscular, and corticomuscular activity during an isometric force precision task. In a repeated measures design, we measured force, EEG and EMG activity from twenty-seven participants who performed 160 isometric contractions of the right hand whilst encouraged to adopt either an internal or external focus through a combination of instructions, secondary tasks, and self-report evaluations. Results indicated that focusing internally led to poorer force accuracy and steadiness compared to an external focus. An internal focus also increased muscle activity of the forearm flexor, increased EEG alpha activity across the parieto-occipital cortex, lowered frontal midline EEG theta activity, and lowered beta corticomuscular coherence between the forearm flexor and contralateral motor cortex. The results of this study provide a holistic understanding of how attentional focus strategies alter neuromuscular control during an isometric force precision task, paving the way for exploring how the behavioural consequences of attentional strategies can be explained at the corticomuscular levels across a wide range of motor tasks and contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fiber-Specific Structural Properties Relate to Reading Skills in Children</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that the cross-sectional relationship between reading skills and white matter microstructure, as indexed by fractional anisotropy, is not as robust as previously thought. Fixel-based analyses yield fiber-specific micro- and macrostructural measures, overcoming several shortcomings of traditional DTI approaches. We ran a whole-brain analysis investigating whether fixel-derived metrics related to single-word reading skills in a large, open, quality-controlled data set of 983 children and adolescents ages 6-18. We also compared fixel metrics between participants with (n = 102) and without (n = 570) reading disabilities. We found that the product of fiber density (FD) and cross-section (FC), or FDC, positively related to reading skills throughout the brain, especially in left temporoparietal and cerebellar white matter, but did not differ between groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that among metrics from other diffusion models - DTI, DKI, and NODDI - only orientation dispersion index (ODI) from NODDI was associated (inversely) with reading skills. Our findings further support the importance of left-hemisphere dorsal temporoparietal white matter tracts in reading. Additionally, our results suggest future DWI studies of reading should be designed to benefit from advanced diffusion models, include cerebellar coverage, and consider continuous analyses that account for individual differences in reading skill.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human Brain Development: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study integrating multiple neuromorphological features</a></h4>

              
                Brain maturation studies typically examine relationships linking a single morphometric feature with aspects of cognition, behavior, age, or other demographic characteristics. However, the coordinated spatiotemporal arrangement of morphological features across development and their associations with behavior are unclear. Here, we examine covariation across multiple cortical features (cortical thickness [CT], surface area [SA], local gyrification index [GI], and mean curvature [MC]) using magnetic resonance images from the long-running National Institute of Mental Health developmental cohort (ages 5-25). Neuroanatomical covariance was examined using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which decomposes covariance resulting in a parts-based representation. Cross-sectionally, we identified six components of covariation which demonstrate differential contributions of CT, GI, and SA in hetero- vs. unimodal areas. We sought to use this technique longitudinally to examine covariance in rates of change, which highlighted a preserved SA in unimodal areas and changes in CT and GI in heteromodal areas. Using behavioral partial least squares (PLS), we identified a single latent variable (LV; 96 % covariance explained) that recapitulated patterns of reduced CT, GI, and SA that are generally related to older age, with limited contributions of IQ and SES. Longitudinally, PLS revealed three LVs that demonstrated a nuanced developmental pattern that highlighted a higher rate of maturational change in SA and CT in higher IQ and SES females. This novel characterization of brain maturation provides an important understanding of the interdependencies between morphological measures, their coordinated development, and their relationship to biological sex, cognitive ability, and the resources of the local environment.

                Hearing and vision sensory systems are tuned to the natural statistics of acoustic and electromagnetic energy on earth, and are evolved to be sensitive in ethologically relevant ranges. But what are the natural statistics of odors, and how do olfactory systems exploit them? Dissecting an accurate machine learning model for human odor perception, we find a computable representation for odor at the molecular level that can predict the odor-evoked receptor, neural, and behavioral responses of nearly all terrestrial organisms studied in olfactory neuroscience. Using this olfactory representation (Primary Odor Map, POM), we find that odorous compounds with similar POM representations are more likely to co-occur within a substance and be metabolically closely related; metabolic reaction sequences also follow smooth paths in POM despite large jumps in molecular structure. Just as the brain's visual representations have evolved around the natural statistics of light and shapes, the natural statistics of metabolism appear to shape the brain's representation of the olfactory world.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive decision making depends on pupil-linked arousal in rats performing tactile discrimination tasks</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decision making is a dynamic cognitive process and is shaped by many factors, including behavioral state, reward contingency, and sensory environment. To understand the extent to which adaptive behavior in decision making is dependent upon pupil-linked arousal, we trained head-fixed rats to perform perceptual decision making tasks and systematically manipulated the probability of Go and No-go stimuli while simultaneously measuring their pupil size in the tasks. Our data demonstrated that the animals adaptively modified their behavior in response to the changes in the sensory environment. The response probability to both Go and No-go stimuli decreased as the probability of the Go stimulus being presented decreased. Analyses within the signal detection theory framework showed that while the perceptual sensitivity of the animals was invariant, their decision criterion increased as the probability of the Go stimulus decreased. Simulation results indicated that the adaptive increase in the decision criterion will increase possible water rewards during the task. Moreover, the adaptive decision making is dependent upon pupil-linked arousal as the increase in the decision criterion was the largest during low pupil-linked arousal periods. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the rats were able to adjust their decision making to maximize rewards in the tasks, and that adaptive behavior in perceptual decision making is dependent upon pupil-linked arousal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct mechanisms of CB1 and GABAB receptor presynaptic modulation of striatal indirect pathway projections to mouse Globus Pallidus</a></h4>

              
                Presynaptic modulation is a fundamental process regulating synaptic transmission. Striatal indirect pathway projections originate from A2A- expressing spiny projection neurons (iSPNs), targeting the globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and control the firing of the tonically active GPe neurons via GABA release. It is unclear if and how the presynaptic GPCRs, GABAB and CB1 receptors, modulate iSPN projections. Here we used an optogenetic platform to study presynaptic Ca2+ and GABAergic transmission at iSPN projections, using a genetic strategy to express the calcium sensor GCaMP6f or the excitatory channelrhodopsin (hChR2) on iSPNs. We found that P/Q-type calcium channels are the primary VGCC-subtype controlling presynaptic calcium and GABA release at iSPN-GPe projections. N-type and L-type VGCCs contribute to GABA release at iSPN-GPe projections. GABAB receptor activation resulted in a reversible inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ transients (PreCaTs) and an inhibition of GABAergic transmission at iSPN-GPe synapses. CB1 receptor activation did not inhibit PreCaTs while inhibiting GABAergic oIPSCs at iSPN-GPe synapses. CB1 effects on GABAergic transmission persisted in experiments where NaV and KV1 were blocked, indicating a VGCC- and KV1 independent presynaptic mechanism of action of CB1 receptors. Taken together, presynaptic modulation of iSPN-GPe projections by CB1 and GABAB receptors is mediated by distinct mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared and distinct neural activity during anticipation and outcome of win and loss: A meta-analysis of the monetary incentive delay task</a></h4>

              
                Reward and punishment motivate decision making and behavioral changes. Numerous studies have examined regional activities during anticipation and outcome of win and loss in the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT). However, the great majority of studies reported findings of anticipation or outcome and of win or loss alone. It remains unclear how the neural correlates share and differentiate amongst these processes. We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of 77 studies of the MIDT (5,779 subjects), including 24 published since the most recent meta-analysis, to identify and, with conjunction and subtraction, contrast regional responses to win anticipation, loss anticipation, win outcome, and loss outcome. Win and loss anticipation engaged a shared network of bilateral anterior insula (AI), striatum, thalamus, supplementary motor area (SMA), and precentral gyrus. Win and loss outcomes did not share regional activities. Win and loss outcome each engaged higher activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Bilateral striatum and right occipital cortex responded to both anticipation and outcome of win, and right AI to both phases of loss. Win anticipation vs. outcome engaged higher activity in bilateral AI, striatum, SMA and precentral gyrus and right thalamus, and lower activity in bilateral mOFC and posterior cingulate cortex as well as right inferior frontal and angular gyri. Loss anticipation relative to outcome involved higher activity in bilateral striatum and left AI. These findings collectively suggest shared and distinct regional responses during monetary wins and losses. Delineating the neural correlates of these component processes may facilitate empirical research of motivated behavior and dysfunctional approach and avoidance in psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring Stop Signal Reaction Time Over Two Sessions of the Anticipatory Response Inhibition Task</a></h4>

              
                Various behavioural tasks can measure the motor component of impulse control, response inhibition. Response inhibition encompasses the ability to cancel unwanted actions and is evaluated via stop signal reaction time (SSRT). The current study explored the effect of two sessions on SSRT within the anticipatory response inhibition task (ARIT) and how this compared to the stop signal task (SST). Forty-four participants completed two sessions of the ARIT and SST, 24 hours apart. SSRT and its constituent measures (Go trial reaction time, stop signal delay) were calculated. SSRT reflecting non-selective inhibition was consistent between sessions in both tasks (both p > .293). Reaction time and stop signal delay also remained stable across sessions in the ARIT (all p > .063), whereas in the SST, both reaction time (p = .013) and stop signal delay (p = .009) increased. Across the two sessions, SSRT reflecting partial inhibition improved (p < .001), which was underpinned by changes to reaction time (p < .001) and stop signal delay (p < .001). The maximal efficiency of non-selective inhibition remained stable across two sessions in the ARIT. Results of the SST confirmed that non-selective inhibition can however be affected by more than inhibitory network integrity when Go trial reaction times are not constrained in task design. Partial response inhibition measures changed across sessions, suggesting the sequential process captured by the SSRT occurred more quickly in session two. These findings highlight the absence/extent of inherent SSRT changes possible during multiple-session study designs e.g., pre/post, or active/sham comparisons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization and Preclinical Treatment of Rotational Force-Induced Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Millions of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur annually. TBIs commonly result from falls, traffic accidents, and sports-related injuries, all of which involve rotational acceleration/deceleration of the brain. During these injuries, the brain endures a multitude of primary insults including compression of brain tissue, damaged vasculature, and diffuse axonal injury. All of these deleterious effects can contribute to secondary brain ischemia, cellular death, and neuroinflammation that progress for weeks to months after injury and impede neurological recovery. While the linear effects of head trauma have been extensively modeled, less is known about how rotational injuries mediate neuronal damage following injury. Here, we developed a new model of rotational head trauma in rodents and extensively characterized the pathological, behavioral, and electrophysiological effects of rotational TBI (rTBI). We identify aberrant cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity as a principal mediator of rTBI and show pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 reduces the cognitive and pathological consequences of injury. Finally, we utilize Cdk5-enriched phosphoproteomics to uncover potential downstream mediators of rTBI. These studies contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the mechanisms of rTBI and how they may be effectively treated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal progression along discrete coding states during decision-making in the mouse gustatory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mouse gustatory cortex (GC) is involved in taste-guided decision-making in addition to sensory processing. Rodent GC exhibits metastable neural dynamics during ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity, but how these dynamics evolve in the context of a taste-based decision-making task remains unclear. Here we employ analytical and modeling approaches to i) extract metastable dynamics in ensemble spiking activity recorded from the GC of mice performing a perceptual decision-making task; ii) investigate the computational mechanisms underlying GC metastability in this task; and iii) establish a relationship between GC dynamics and behavioral performance. Our results show that activity in GC during perceptual decision-making is metastable and that this metastability may serve as a substrate for sequentially encoding sensory, abstract cue, and decision information over time. Perturbations of the model's metastable dynamics indicate that boosting inhibition in different coding epochs differentially impacts network performance, explaining a counterintuitive effect of GC optogenetic silencing on mouse behavior.

                Humans and animals alike form oppositely valenced memories for stimuli that predict the occurrence versus the termination of a reward: appetitive 'reward' memory for stimuli associated with the occurrence of a reward and aversive 'frustration' memory for stimuli that are associated with its termination. We characterize these memories in larval Drosophila using a combination of Pavlovian conditioning, optogenetic activation of the dopaminergic central-brain DAN-i1864 neuron, and high-resolution video-tracking. This reveals their dependency on the number of training trials and the duration of DAN-i1864 activation, their temporal stability, and the parameters of locomotion that are modulated during memory expression. Together with previous results on 'punishment' versus 'relief' learning by DAN-f1 neuron activation, this reveals a 2x2 matrix of timing-dependent memory valence for the occurrence/ termination of reward/ punishment. These findings should aid the understanding and modelling of how brains decipher the predictive, causal structure of events around a target reinforcing occurrence.

                Neural migration is a critical step during brain development that requires the interactions of cell-surface guidance receptors. Cancer cells often hijack these mechanisms to disseminate. Here we reveal crystal structures of Uncoordinated-5 receptor D (Unc5D) in complex with morphogen receptor glypican-3 (GPC3), forming an octameric glycoprotein complex. In the complex, four Unc5D molecules pack into an antiparallel bundle, flanked by four GPC3 molecules. Central glycan-glycan interactions are formed by N-linked glycans emanating from GPC3 (N241 in human) and C-mannosylated tryptophans of the Unc5D thrombospondin-like domains. MD simulations, mass-spectrometry and structure-based mutants validate the crystallographic data. Anti-GPC3 nanobodies enhance or weaken Unc5-GPC3 binding. Using these tools in vivo, we show that Unc5/GPC3 guide migrating pyramidal neurons in the mouse cortex, and cancer cells in an embryonic xenograft neuroblastoma model. The results demonstrate a conserved structural mechanism of cell-guidance, with the potential for wide- ranging biomedical implications in development and cancer biology.

                Women show an increased lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to men. Characteristic brain connectivity changes, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), have been associated with both symptomatic and preclinical AD, but the impact of sex on DMN function throughout aging is poorly understood. We investigated sex differences in DMN connectivity over the lifespan in 595 cognitively healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project - Aging cohort. We used the intrinsic connectivity distribution (a robust voxel-based metric of functional connectivity) and a seed connectivity approach to determine sex differences within the DMN and between the DMN and whole brain. Compared with men, women demonstrated increased connectivity with age in posterior DMN nodes and decreased connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Differences were most prominent in the decades surrounding menopause. Seed-based analysis revealed increased connectivity in women from the posterior cingulate to angular gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, which correlated with neuropsychological measures of declarative memory. Taken together, we show significant sex differences in DMN subnetworks over the lifespan, including patterns in aging women that resemble changes previously seen in preclinical AD. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex in neuroimaging studies of aging and neurodegeneration.

                The ventral pallidum (VP), a core structure of the reward circuit, is well-associated with appetitive behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that this basal forebrain nucleus may have an overarching role in affective processing, including behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. We investigated this possibility by utilizing selective immunotoxin lesions and a series of behavioral tests in adult male Wistar rats. We made bilateral GAT1-Saporin, 192-IgG-Saporin or PBS (vehicle) injections into the VP to respectively eliminate GABAergic and cholinergic neurons, and tested the animals in the forced swim test (FST), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM) and cued fear conditioning. Both GAT1-Saporin and 192-IgG-Saporin injections reduced behavioral despair without altering general locomotor activity. This antidepressant-like effect was accompanied by reduced freezing and increased darting in the acquisition phase of cued fear conditioning. In the test phase, cholinergic, but not GABAergic lesions, impaired context-dependent fear memory, while both groups showed diminished conditioned freezing in a novel context. In line with this, selective cholinergic lesions impaired spatial memory in the MWM as compared to GAT1-Saporin or vehicle-injected animals. No differential effect was observed in anxiety-like behavior assessed in the OFT or EPM. These findings show that both the GABAergic and cholinergic cell groups of the VP contribute to behavioral despair and acquired fear responses by suppressing active coping. In conditioned learning, cholinergic ventral pallidal neurons contribute to the fear response in a context-independent manner, while the GABAergic population is required when the context information is missing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative Census of Local Somatic Features in Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian neocortex contains a highly diverse set of cell types. These types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches. Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell type specialization. While many morphological surveys focus on branching patterns of individual cells, fewer have been devoted to sub-cellular structure of cells. Electron microscopy (EM) provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective into the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometer scale morphology. Here we present the first systematic survey of the somatic region of nearly 100,000 cortical cells, using quantitative features obtained from EM. This analysis demonstrates a surprising sufficiency of the perisomatic region to recapitulate many known aspects of cortical organization, while also revealing novel relationships. Parameters of cell size, nuclear infolding and somatic synaptic innervation co-vary with distinct patterns across depth and between types. Further, we describe how these subcellular features can be used to create highly accurate predictions of cell-types across large scale EM datasets. More generally, our results suggest that the shifts in cellular physiology and molecular programming seen across cell types accompany profound differences in the fine-scale structure of cells.

	<p>Recommended treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) includes stimulant medication. While these medicines are effective for most ADHD patients, benefits may wear off, suggesting tolerance. This paper reviews the published literature on tolerance to stimulant medication treatment for ADHD. As there are relatively few studies published, pivotal studies and ADHD treatment guidelines were also reviewed. Research demonstrates physiological changes related to continued stimulant usage in neurons and certain brain regions, suggesting a mechanism for tolerance development. One clinical study showed that 24.7% of patients developed tolerance to stimulants in the time of days to weeks; another showed 2.7% developed tolerance over 10 years. Long term follow-up studies demonstrate that medication response may lessen over longer durations of treatment in a high percentage of patients. Strategies to manage tolerance include switching stimulant medicines, drug holidays, or clinical reassessment. Three cases illustrate challenges with treating patients who develop tolerance to stimulant medication. The paucity of research and lack of guidance to clinicians may contribute to significant under recognition of tolerance to stimulant medication. Further research is required to define clinical tolerance for stimulants in ADHD and to provide guidance on identifying and managing tolerance in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Co-registration of stereotactic and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images can serve as an alternative for trajectory planning. However, the role of this strategy has not yet been proven by any control studies, and the trajectories of commonly used targets have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the trajectories for various targets, and to assess the role of trajectories realized on fused images in preventing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Data from 1019 patients who underwent electrode placement for deep brain stimulation were acquired. Electrode trajectories were not planned for 396 patients, whereas trajectories were planned for 623 patients. Preoperative various MRI sequences and frame-placed MRI images were fused for trajectory planning. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical characteristics, the stereotactic systems, intracranial hemorrhage cases, and trajectory angles were recorded and analyzed. No statistically significant differences in the proportions of male patients, patients receiving local anesthesia, and diseases or target distributions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05) were found between the trajectory planning group and the non-trajectory planning group, but statistically significant differences were observed in the numbers of both patients and leads associated with symptomatic ICH (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Regarding the ring and arc angle values, statistically significant differences were found among various target groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The anatomic structures through which leads passed were found to be diverse. Trajectory planning based on MRI fusion is a safe technique for lead placement. The electrode for each given target has its own relatively constant trajectory.</p>

	<p>Background and Purpose: Previous studies showed that acute reocclusion after endovascular therapy is related to residual stenosis. However, we observed that reperfusion status but not residual stenosis severity is related to acute reocclusion. This study aimed to assess which factor mention above is more likely to be associated with artery reocclusion after endovascular treatment. Methods: This study included 86 acute ischemic stroke patients who had middle cerebral artery (MCA) atherosclerotic occlusions and received endovascular treatment within 24 h of a stroke. The primary outcomes included intraprocedural reocclusion assessed during endovascular treatment and delayed reocclusion assessed through follow-up angiography. Results: Of the 86 patients, the intraprocedural reocclusion rate was 7.0% (6/86) and the delayed reocclusion rate was 2.3% (2/86). Regarding intraprocedural occlusion, for patients with severe residual stenosis, patients with successful thrombectomy reperfusion showed a significantly lower rate than unsuccessful thrombectomy reperfusion (0/30 vs. 6/31, p = 0.003); on the other hand, for patients with successful thrombectomy reperfusion, patients with severe residual stenosis showed no difference from those with mild to moderate residual stenosis in terms of intraprocedural occlusion (0/30 vs. 0/25, p = 1.00). In addition, after endovascular treatment, all patients achieved successful reperfusion. There was no significant difference in the delayed reocclusion rate between patients with severe residual stenosis and those with mild to moderate residual stenosis (2/25 vs. 0/61, p = 0.085). Conclusion: Reperfusion status rather than residual stenosis severity is associated with artery reocclusion after endovascular treatment. Once successful reperfusion was achieved, the reocclusion occurrence was fairly low in MCA atherosclerosis stroke patients, even with severe residual stenosis.</p>

	<p>Background: The role of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) has received increased focus in recent studies on the pathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The predictive value for pharmacological treatment and its link to other health or social limitations has been little-studied. This follow-up research on adult patients with ADHD aimed to explore whether the therapy response and health and social impairments depend on baseline individual NET availability. Methods: Data were collected from 10 patients on personal, family and professional situations, mental and physical health and treatments received after baseline via online and telephone surveys and were compared to baseline data to evaluate treatment-related changes. Results: The majority of our ADHD patients did not show therapy responses but showed improvements due to pharmacological treatment. There was no evidence of relationships between pre-treatment NET availability and therapy response or health/social limitations. Conclusions: Pharmacological monotherapy was insufficient to promote symptom remission, especially for participants with extreme insufficiency in NET availability, but improved outcomes in academic and social functioning. Psychotherapy should be considered as an add-on to the standard treatment approach due to its positive outcome in reducing social limitations. The prognostic value of individual NET availability in predicting the response to therapy needs further studies with large sample sizes.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to investigate the association between the functional connectivity (FC) of the olfactory cortex and olfactory performance in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Eighty-two early PD patients and twenty-one healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological assessments from the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progression Markers Initiative database. A whole brain voxel-wise regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the FC of the entorhinal cortex (EC-FC) and olfactory performance. Then, a one-way ANCOVA, based on the regions of interest, was performed with SPSS to investigate the group differences and correlation analysis that were used to analyze the relationships between the FC and neuropsychological assessments. In addition, regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors for the decreased olfactory function. A significantly negative correlation was observed between the olfactory performance and the left EC-FC in the right dorsal cingulate gyrus (dCC) in patients. The PD patients with anosmia exhibited significantly higher FC values than the PD patients with normal olfaction or the PD patients with mild to moderate microsomia. Except for the olfactory performance, no significant correlation was detected between the neuropsychological assessments and the FC values. A linear regression analysis revealed that the increased FC and Geriatric Depression Scale are independently associated with lower the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test scores. The current findings enhanced the understanding of olfactory dysfunction-related pathophysiological mechanisms in early PD and suggested that the left EC-FC in the right dCC may be a potential neuroimaging biomarker for olfactory performance.</p>

	<p>Dysfunctions in body processing have been documented in adults with brain damage, while limited information is available for children. This study aimed to investigate body processing in children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI) (N = 33), compared to peers with typical development. Two well-known computerized body-representation paradigms, namely Visual Body Recognition and Visuo-spatial Imagery, were administered. Through the first paradigm, the body inversion and composite illusion effects were tested with a matching to sample task as measures of configural and holistic processing of others&amp;amp;rsquo; bodies, respectively. The second paradigm investigated with a laterality judgement task the ability to perform first-person and object-based mental spatial transformations of own body and external objects, respectively. Body stimuli did not convey any emotional contents or symbolic meanings. Patients with TBI had difficulties with mental transformations of both body and object stimuli, displaying deficits in motor and visual imagery abilities, not limited to body processing. Therefore, cognitive rehabilitation of body processing in TBI might benefit from the inclusion of both general training on visuo-spatial abilities and specific exercises aimed at boosting visual body perception and motor imagery.</p>

	<p>Background: Inattention and impulsivity are common causes of accidents and injury. The aim of the current study was to examine the level of attention deficit (AD), hyperactivity, and impulsivity (HI) in individuals with and without self-reported impaired wound healing (IWH). Methods: A survey was conducted among N = 773 Dutch young adults, 18&amp;amp;ndash;30 years old. N = 198 were allocated to the IWH group and N = 575 to the control group. All participants completed the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale. Results: The analysis revealed that the IWH group has significantly higher scores on AD and HI, compared to the control group. Among the IWH group, 12.8% screened positive for AD (compared to 5.8% of the control group) and 14.0% screened positive for HI (compared to 7.4% of the control group). Conclusion: Clinically relevant increased inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity were observed among individuals with self-reported impaired wound healing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: posterior approach with sub-laminar wiring as management of comminuted fracture of the odontoid process of the axis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Odontoid fractures (OF) account for 5-18% and 10-19% of all injuries at C2 and in the cervical region, respectively. According to the Anderson and D'Alonzo classification, there are three main types of OF: Type I, II and III. Most cases involving OF of the axis by high impact trauma result in death. Case presentation: A 21-year-old male patient, with comminuted OF caused by a high impact traffic accident. On admission, the patient reported moderate to severe pain in the posterior craniocervical junction, with significant limitation to lateral rotation of the head and severe cervical muscle spasm. There was evidence of comminuted OF of C2 without apparent displacement in the cervical region. The patient underwent surgery via a posterior approach with double sub-laminar wiring between C1 and C2. The procedure was considered to be completely resolutive with no postoperative complications or sequelae, with total recovery of the patient's functionality. Discussion: The posterior approach is a viable option when the anterior approach is not possible due to the nature of the comminuted fracture and risks of complications, even when it involves a degree of compromise in the rotation of the C1-C2 joint. OF is a medical emergency, requiring individualized treatment tailored to the characteristics of the patient. There are currently no standardized treatment guidelines for OF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Haisu: Hierarchically supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Christopher VanHorn, Murat Can Çobanoğlu</p>

We propose a novel strategy for incorporating hierarchical supervised label information into nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Specifically, we extend t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE to include known or predicted class labels and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Our approach, “Haisu,” is applicable across domains and methods of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In general, the mathematical effect of Haisu can be summarized as a variable perturbation of the high dimensional space in which the original data is observed. We thereby preserve the core characteristics of the visualization method and only change the manifold to respect known or assumed class labels when provided. Our strategy is designed to aid in the discovery and understanding of underlying patterns in a dataset that is heavily influenced by parent-child relationships. We show that using our approach can also help in semi-supervised settings where labels are known for only some datapoints (for instance when only a fraction of the cells are labeled). In summary, Haisu extends existing popular visualization methods to enable a user to incorporate labels known <i>a priori</i> into a visualization, including their hierarchical relationships as defined by a user input graph.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetric and adaptive reward coding via normalized reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenway Louie</p>

Learning is widely modeled in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science by prediction error-guided reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. While standard RL assumes linear reward functions, reward-related neural activity is a saturating, nonlinear function of reward; however, the computational and behavioral implications of nonlinear RL are unknown. Here, we show that nonlinear RL incorporating the canonical divisive normalization computation introduces an intrinsic and tunable asymmetry in prediction error coding. At the behavioral level, this asymmetry explains empirical variability in risk preferences typically attributed to asymmetric learning rates. At the neural level, diversity in asymmetries provides a computational mechanism for recently proposed theories of distributional RL, allowing the brain to learn the full probability distribution of future rewards. This behavioral and computational flexibility argues for an incorporation of biologically valid value functions in computational models of learning and decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The spectrum of covariance matrices of randomly connected recurrent neuronal networks with linear dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Hu, Haim Sompolinsky</p>

A key question in theoretical neuroscience is the relation between the connectivity structure and the collective dynamics of a network of neurons. Here we study the connectivity-dynamics relation as reflected in the distribution of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the dynamic fluctuations of the neuronal activities, which is closely related to the network dynamics’ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the associated effective dimensionality. We consider the spontaneous fluctuations around a steady state in a randomly connected recurrent network of stochastic neurons. An exact analytical expression for the covariance eigenvalue distribution in the large-network limit can be obtained using results from random matrices. The distribution has a finitely supported smooth bulk spectrum and exhibits an approximate power-law tail for coupling matrices near the critical edge. We generalize the results to include second-order connectivity motifs and discuss extensions to excitatory-inhibitory networks. The theoretical results are compared with those from finite-size networks and the effects of temporal and spatial sampling are studied. Preliminary application to whole-brain imaging data is presented. Using simple connectivity models, our work provides theoretical predictions for the covariance spectrum, a fundamental property of recurrent neuronal dynamics, that can be compared with experimental data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic fluctuations promote ordered pattern formation of cells in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Madeline Galbraith, Federico Bocci, José N. Onuchic</p>

The Notch-Delta signaling pathway mediates cell differentiation implicated in many regulatory processes including spatiotemporal patterning in tissues by promoting alternate cell fates between neighboring cells. At the multicellular level, this "lateral inhibition” principle leads to checkerboard patterns with alternation of Sender and Receiver cells. While it is well known that stochasticity modulates cell fate specification, little is known about how stochastic fluctuations at the cellular level propagate during multicell pattern formation. Here, we model stochastic fluctuations in the Notch-Delta pathway in the presence of two different noise types–shot and white–for a multicell system. Our results show that intermediate fluctuations reduce disorder and guide the multicell lattice toward checkerboard-like patterns. By further analyzing cell fate transition events, we demonstrate that intermediate noise amplitudes provide enough perturbation to facilitate “proofreading” of disordered patterns and cause cells to switch to the correct ordered state (Sender surrounded by Receivers, and vice versa). Conversely, high noise can override environmental signals coming from neighboring cells and lead to switching between ordered and disordered patterns. Therefore, in analogy with spin glass systems, intermediate noise levels allow the multicell Notch system to escape frustrated patterns and relax towards the lower energy checkerboard pattern while at large noise levels the system is unable to find this ordered base of attraction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the modulation of cortical Up-Down state switching by astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lisa Blum Moyse, Hugues Berry</p>

Up-Down synchronization in neuronal networks refers to spontaneous switches between periods of high collective firing activity (Up state) and periods of silence (Down state). Recent experimental reports have shown that astrocytes can control the emergence of such Up-Down regimes in neural networks, although the molecular or cellular mechanisms that are involved are still uncertain. Here we propose neural network models made of three populations of cells: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes, interconnected by synaptic and gliotransmission events, to explore how astrocytes can control this phenomenon. The presence of astrocytes in the models is indeed observed to promote the emergence of Up-Down regimes with realistic characteristics. Our models show that the difference of signalling timescales between astrocytes and neurons (seconds versus milliseconds) can induce a regime where the frequency of gliotransmission events released by the astrocytes does not synchronize with the Up and Down phases of the neurons, but remains essentially stable. However, these gliotransmission events are found to change the localization of the bifurcations in the parameter space so that with the addition of astrocytes, the network enters a bistability region of the dynamics that corresponds to Up-Down synchronization. Taken together, our work provides a theoretical framework to test scenarios and hypotheses on the modulation of Up-Down dynamics by gliotransmission from astrocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pooling strategies in V1 can account for the functional and structural diversity across species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Victor Boutin, Angelo Franciosini, Frédéric Chavane, Laurent U. Perrinet</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective to orientation with various degrees of selectivity to the spatial phase, from high selectivity in simple cells to low selectivity in complex cells. Various computational models have suggested a possible link between the presence of phase invariant cells and the existence of orientation maps in higher mammals’ V1. These models, however, do not explain the emergence of complex cells in animals that do not show orientation maps. In this study, we build a theoretical model based on a convolutional network called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) and show that a single computational mechanism, pooling, allows the SDPC model to account for the emergence in V1 of complex cells with or without that of orientation maps, as observed in distinct species of mammals. In particular, we observed that pooling in the feature space is directly related to the orientation map formation while pooling in the retinotopic space is responsible for the emergence of a complex cells population. Introducing different forms of pooling in a predictive model of early visual processing as implemented in SDPC can therefore be viewed as a theoretical framework that explains the diversity of structural and functional phenomena observed in V1.

Conferences are spaces to meet and network within and across academic and technical fields, learn about new advances, and share our work. They can help define career paths and create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities. However, these opportunities are not equal for all. This article introduces 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference based on the authors’ recent experience organizing the 2021 edition of the useR! statistical computing conference, which attracted a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector. Coming from different backgrounds, career stages, and even continents, we embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and making it a kind, inclusive, and accessible experience for as many people as possible. The rules result from our lessons learned before, during, and after the organization of the conference. They have been written mainly for potential organizers and selection committees of conferences and contain multiple practical tips to help a variety of events become more accessible and inclusive. We see this as a starting point for conversations and efforts towards building more inclusive conferences across the world. * Translated versions of the English abstract and the list of rules are available in 10 languages in S1 Text: Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Thai.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Helix 8 in chemotactic receptors of the complement system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Szymon Wisniewski, Paulina Dragan, Anna Makal, Dorota Latek</p>

Host response to infection involves the activation of the complement system leading to the production of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Complement factor C5a exerts its effect through the activation of C5aR1, chemotactic receptor 1, and triggers the G protein-coupled signaling cascade. Orthosteric and allosteric antagonists of C5aR1 are a novel strategy for anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we discuss recent crystal structures of inactive C5aR1 in terms of an inverted orientation of helix H8, unobserved in other GPCR structures. An analysis of mutual interactions of subunits in the C5aR1—G protein complex has provided new insights into the activation mechanism of this distinct receptor. By comparing two C5aR receptors C5aR1 and C5aR2 we explained differences between their signaling pathways on the molecular level. By means of molecular dynamics we explained why C5aR2 cannot transduce signal through the G protein pathway but instead recruits beta-arrestin. A comparison of microsecond MD trajectories started from active and inactive C5aR1 receptor conformations has provided insights into details of local and global changes in the transmembrane domain induced by interactions with the Gα subunit and explained the impact of inverted H8 on the C5aR1 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Gr64 cluster of gustatory receptors promotes survival and proteostasis of epithelial cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael E. Baumgartner, Alex Mastrogiannopoulos, Iwo Kucinski, Paul F. Langton, Eugenia Piddini</p>

Gustatory Receptor 64 (Gr64) genes are a cluster of 6 neuronally expressed receptors involved in sweet taste sensation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Gr64s modulate calcium signalling and excitatory responses to several different sugars. Here, we discover an unexpected nonneuronal function of Gr64 receptors and show that they promote proteostasis in epithelial cells affected by proteotoxic stress. Using heterozygous mutations in ribosome proteins (<i>Rp</i>), which have recently been shown to induce proteotoxic stress and protein aggregates in cells, we show that <i>Rp/+</i> cells in <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs up-regulate expression of the entire Gr64 cluster and depend on these receptors for survival. We further show that loss of Gr64 in <i>Rp/+</i> cells exacerbates stress pathway activation and proteotoxic stress by negatively affecting autophagy and proteasome function. This work identifies a noncanonical role in proteostasis maintenance for a family of gustatory receptors known for their function in neuronal sensation.

Strong genetic evidence supports an imbalance between production and clearance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia that are potentially involved in alternative mechanisms are actually integral to the amyloid cascade. Fluid biomarkers and brain imaging place accumulation of Aβ at the beginning of molecular and clinical changes in the disease. So why have clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies not provided clear-cut benefits to patients with AD? Can anti-amyloid therapies robustly decrease Aβ in the human brain, and if so, could this lowering be too little, too late? These central questions in research on AD are being urgently addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Likely community transmission of COVID-19 infections between neighboring, persistent hotspots in Ontario, Canada [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to support decision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis, space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positive individuals. Methods: COVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) in municipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran’s I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries. The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-available software, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital maps for public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contact tracing and distribution of other resources.  Results: This study provided indicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission through innovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging. Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, and presence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions: Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.

                Historically, oral sex is part of human sexual behaviour even though some consider it taboo, and its expression is deemed inappropriate. Human rights also stand out as technology becomes more sophisticated, leading to its practice disclosure in the 21st century. The large-scale oral sex discussion in media encourages people to express it, and there is feedback on whether it is right or not. It all depends on each person’s values. We found this sexual behaviour occurs everywhere regardless of religion, culture and race. Pop culture influences this behaviour considerably. It can be seen in music, movies and television programmes that allude to oral sex. Numerous motivations underlying this behaviour include sexual pleasure for the sake of psychological well-being. It is undeniable that this behaviour is still controversial. There is a risk of it causing disease, but it reportedly provides many benefits. Oral sex is not a new behaviour crossing boundaries, according to our theory. It is an old behaviour that has been highlighted because of the factors that support it. This behaviour, still considered taboo, has its disadvantages, such as sexually transmitted disease and oral cancer, but also has benefits, such as preventing preeclampsia.

                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells use T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complexes, and CD4, to respond to peptide antigens within MHCII molecules (pMHCII). We report here that, through ~435 million years of evolution in jawed vertebrates, purifying selection has shaped motifs in the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains of eutherian CD4 that enhance pMHCII responses, and covary with residues in an intracellular motif that inhibits responses. Importantly, while CD4 interactions with the Src kinase, Lck, are viewed as key to pMHCII responses, our data indicate that CD4-Lck interactions derive their importance from the counterbalancing activity of the inhibitory motif, as well as motifs that direct CD4-Lck pairs to specific membrane compartments. These results have implications for the evolution and function of complex transmembrane receptors and for biomimetic engineering.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping odorant sensitivities reveals a sparse but structured representation of olfactory chemical space by sensory input to the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                In olfactory systems, convergence of sensory neurons onto glomeruli generates a map of odorant receptor identity. How glomerular maps relate to sensory space remains unclear. We sought to better characterize this relationship in the mouse olfactory system by defining glomeruli in terms of the odorants to which they are most sensitive. Using high-throughput odorant delivery and ultrasensitive imaging of sensory inputs, we imaged responses to 185 odorants presented at concentrations determined to activate only one or a few glomeruli across the dorsal olfactory bulb. The resulting datasets defined the tuning properties of glomeruli - and, by inference, their cognate odorant receptors - in a low-concentration regime, and yielded consensus maps of glomerular sensitivity across a wide range of chemical space. Glomeruli were extremely narrowly tuned, with ~25% responding to only one odorant, and extremely sensitive, responding to their effective odorants at sub-picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Such narrow tuning in this concentration regime allowed for reliable functional identification of many glomeruli based on a single diagnostic odorant. At the same time, the response spectra of glomeruli responding to multiple odorants was best predicted by straightforward odorant structural features, and glomeruli sensitive to distinct odorants with common structural features were spatially clustered. These results define an underlying structure to the primary representation of sensory space by the mouse olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Claudin5 protects the peripheral endothelial barrier in an organ and vessel type-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunctional and leaky blood vessels resulting from disruption of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier accompanies numerous diseases. The EC barrier is established through endothelial cell tight and adherens junctions. However, the expression patterning and precise contribution of different junctional proteins to the EC barrier is poorly understood. Here, we focus on organs with continuous endothelium to identify structural and functional <i>in vivo</i> characteristics of the EC barrier. Assembly of multiple single-cell RNAseq datasets into a single integrated database revealed the variability and commonalities of EC barrier patterning. Across tissues, Claudin5 exhibited diminishing expression along the arteriovenous axis, correlating with EC barrier integrity. Functional analysis identified tissue-specific differences in leakage patterning and response to the leakage agonist histamine. Loss of Claudin5 enhanced histamine-induced leakage in an organotypic and vessel type-specific manner in an inducible, EC-specific, knock-out mouse. Mechanistically, Claudin5 loss left junction ultrastructure unaffected but altered its composition, with concomitant loss of zonula occludens-1 and upregulation of VE-Cadherin expression. These findings uncover the organ-specific organisation of the EC barrier and distinct importance of Claudin5 in different vascular beds, providing insights to modify EC barrier stability in a targeted, organ-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeted depletion of uterine glandular Foxa2 induces embryonic diapause in mice</a></h4>

              
                Embryonic diapause is a reproductive strategy in which embryo development and growth is temporarily arrested within the uterus to ensure the survival of neonates and mothers during unfavorable conditions. Pregnancy is reinitiated when conditions become favorable for neonatal survival. The mechanism of how the uterus enters diapause in various species remains unclear. Mice with uterine depletion of <i>Foxa2</i>, a transcription factor, are infertile. In this study, we show that dormant blastocysts are recovered from these mice on day 8 of pregnancy with persistent expression of uterine <i>Msx1</i>, a gene critical to maintaining the uterine quiescent state, suggesting that these mice enter embryonic diapause. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can resume implantation in these mice. Although estrogen is critical for implantation in progesterone-primed uterus, our current model reveals that FOXA2-independent estrogenic effects are detrimental to sustaining uterine quiescence. Interestingly, P<sub>4</sub> and anti-estrogen can prolong uterine quiescence in the absence of FOXA2. Although we find that <i>Msx1</i> expression persists in the uterus deficient in <i>Foxa2</i>, the complex relationship of FOXA2 with <i>Msx</i> genes and estrogen receptors remains to be explored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single nuclei analyses reveal transcriptional profiles and marker genes for diverse supraspinal populations</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain contains numerous neurons distributed across forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain that project axons to the lower spinal cord and work in concert to control movement and achieve homeostasis. Extensive work has mapped the anatomical location of supraspinal cell types and continues to establish specific physiological functions. The patterns of gene expression that typify and distinguish these disparate populations, however, are mostly unknown. Here we combined retrograde labeling of supraspinal cell nuclei with fluorescence activated nuclei sorting and single nuclei RNA sequencing analyses to transcriptionally profile neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to lumbar spinal cord. We identified fourteen transcriptionally distinct cell types and used a combination of established and newly identified marker genes to assign an anatomical location to each. To validate the putative marker genes, we visualized selected transcripts and confirmed selective expression within lumbar-projecting neurons in discrete supraspinal regions. Finally, we illustrate the potential utility of these data by examining the expression of transcription factors that distinguish different supraspinal cell types and by surveying the expression of receptors for growth and guidance cues that may be present in the spinal cord. Collectively these data establish transcriptional differences between anatomically defined supraspinal populations, identify a new set of marker genes of use in future experiments, and provide insight into potential differences in cellular and physiological activity across the supraspinal connectome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coupling of oxytocin and cholecystokinin pathways in the hypothalamus is required for gut-to-brain homeostatic feeding control</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin-expressing paraventricular hypothalamic neurons (PVN-OT neurons) integrate afferent signals from the gut including cholecystokinin (CCK) to adjust whole-body energy homeostasis. However, the molecular underpinnings by which PVN-OT neurons orchestrate gut-to-brain feeding control remain unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing selective ablation of PVN-OT neurons fail to reduce food intake in response to CCK and develop hyperphagic obesity on chow diet. Notably, exposing wildtype mice to a high-fat/high-sugar (HFHS) diet recapitulates this insensitivity towards CCK, which is linked to diet-induced transcriptional and electrophysiological aberrations specifically in PVN-OT neurons. Restoring OT pathways in DIO mice via chemogenetics or polypharmacology sufficiently re-establishes CCKs anorexigenic effects. Lastly, by single-cell profiling, we identify a specialized PVN-OT neuronal subpopulation with increased {kappa}-opioid signaling under HFHS diet, which restrains their CCK-evoked activation. In sum, we here document a novel (patho)mechanism by which PVN-OT signaling uncouples a gut-brain satiation pathway under obesogenic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction error neurons in mouse cortex are molecularly targetable cell types</a></h4>

              
                Predictive processing postulates the existence of prediction error neurons in cortex. Functionally, both negative and positive prediction error neurons have been identified in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, but whether they correspond to transcriptionally defined subpopulations is unclear. Here we used the activity-dependent, photoconvertible marker CaMPARI2 to tag neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex during stimuli and behaviors designed to trigger prediction errors. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on these populations and found that previously annotated Adamts2 and Rrad layer 2/3 cell types were enriched when photolabeling for negative or positive prediction error responses respectively. Finally, we validated these results functionally by designing artificial promoters for use in AAV vectors to express genetically encoded calcium indicators. Thus, positive and negative prediction error responses mapped onto transcriptionally distinct cell types in layer 2/3 that can be targeted using AAV vectors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-implanted conductors amplify radiofrequency fields in rodents: advantages and risks</a></h4>

              
                Over the past few decades, daily exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields has been increasing due to the rapid development of wireless and medical imaging technologies. Under extreme circumstances, exposure to very strong RF energy can lead to heating of body tissue, even resulting in tissue injury. The presence of implanted devices, moreover, can amplify RF effects on surrounding tissue. Therefore, it is important to understand the interactions of RF fields with tissue in the presence of implants, in order to establish appropriate wireless safety protocols, and also to extend the benefits of medical imaging to increasing numbers of people with implanted medical devices. This study explored the neurological effects of RF exposure in rodents implanted with neuronal recording electrodes. We exposed freely moving and anesthetized rats and mice to 950 MHz RF energy while monitoring their brain activity, temperature, and behavior. We found that RF exposure could induce fast onset firing of single neurons without heat injury. In addition, brain implants enhanced the effect of RF stimulation resulting in reversible behavioral changes. Using an optical temperature measurement system, we found greater than tenfold increase in brain temperature in the vicinity of the implant. On the one hand, our results underline the importance of careful safety assessment for brain implanted devices, but on the other hand, we also show that metal implants may be used for neurostimulation if brain temperature can be kept within safe limits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Superficial white matter across the lifespan: volume, thickness, change, and relationship with cortical features</a></h4>

              
                Superficial white matter (SWM) represents a significantly understudied part of the human brain, despite comprising a large portion of brain volume and making up a majority of cortical structural connections. Using multiple, high-quality, datasets with large sample sizes (N=2421, age range 5-100) in combination with methodological advances in tractography, we quantified features of SWM volume and thickness across the brain and across the lifespan. We address four questions: (1) How does U-fiber volume change with age? (2) What does U-fiber thickness look like across the brain? (3) How does SWM thickness change with age? (4) Are there relationships between SWM thickness and cortical features? Our main findings are that (1) SWM volume shows unique volumetric trajectories with age that are distinct from gray matter and other white matter trajectories; (2) SWM thickness varies across the brain, with patterns robust across individuals and across the population at the region-level and vertex-level; (3) SWM shows nonlinear changes across the lifespan that vary across regions; and (4) SWM thickness is associated with cortical thickness and curvature. For the first time, we show that SWM volume follows a similar trend as overall white matter volume, peaking at a similar time in adolescence, leveling off throughout adulthood, and decreasing with age thereafter. Notably, the relative fraction of total brain volume of SWM continuously increases with age, and consequently takes up a larger proportion of total white matter volume, unlike the other tissue types that decrease with respect to total brain volume. This study represents the first characterization of SWM features across the lifespan and provides the background for characterizing normal aging and insight into the mechanisms associated with SWM development and decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endogenous Retroviruses and TDP-43 Proteinopathy Form a Sustaining Feedback to Drive the Intercellular Spread of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders are thought to initiate focally and then spread over time through neural circuits. A mechanism that has been proposed to explain this is the inter-cellular movement of misfolded prion-like proteins that then recruit normally folded proteins in recipient cells to also adopt pathological conformations. Such a mechanism has been proposed, for example, to explain the propagation of abnormally phosphorylated cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR-DNA-Binding protein (TDP-43) during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). But unlike transmissible prion diseases such as mad cow disease, which can be caused by ingestion or by injection into animal brains of misfolded PrP, ALS and FTD are not infectious and the injection of phosphorylated and aggregated TDP-43 protein into rodent brains is not sufficient to cause disease phenotypes unless those animals also express high levels of transgenic TDP-43 protein. This suggests a missing component of a positive feedback that is necessary to sustain disease progression. We provide evidence that endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are that missing component. We demonstrate that ERV expression and TDP-43 proteinopathy are mutually reinforcing. Expression of either the Drosophila ERV, gypsy (mdg4) or the human ERV, HERV-K (HML-2) are each sufficient to stimulate cytoplasmic aggregation of human TDP-43. Importantly. We also demonstrate that viral ERV transmission causes propagation of such TDP-43 pathology to cells that express physiological levels of TDP-43, whether they are in contact or at a distance. This mechanism underlies the toxicity of glial cells to neurons and other glia in a Drosophila in vivo model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic age acceleration is associated with oligodendrocyte proportions in MSA and control brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Epigenetic clocks are widely applied as surrogates for biological age in different tissues and/or diseases, including several neurodegenerative diseases. Despite white matter (WM) changes often being observed in neurodegenerative diseases, no study has investigated epigenetic ageing in white matter. Methods: We analysed the performances of two DNA methylation-based clocks, DNAmClockMulti and DNAmClockCortical, in post-mortem WM tissue from multiple subcortical regions and the cerebellum, and in oligodendrocyte-enriched nuclei. We also examined epigenetic ageing in control and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (WM and mixed WM and grey matter), as MSA is a neurodegenerative disease comprising pronounced WM changes and alpha-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes. Results: Estimated DNA methylation (DNAm) ages showed strong correlations with chronological ages, even in WM (e.g., DNAmClockCortical, r = [0.80-0.97], p<0.05). However, performances and DNAm age estimates differed between clocks and brain regions. DNAmClockMulti significantly underestimated ages in all cohorts except in the MSA prefrontal cortex mixed tissue, whereas DNAmClockCortical tended towards age overestimations. Pronounced age overestimations in the oligodendrocyte-enriched cohorts (e.g., oligodendrocyte-enriched nuclei, p=6.1x10-5) suggested that this cell-type ages faster. Indeed, significant positive correlations were observed between estimated oligodendrocyte proportions and DNAm age acceleration estimated by DNAmClockCortical (r>0.31, p<0.05), and similar trends with DNAmClockMulti. Although increased age acceleration was observed in MSA compared to controls, no significant differences were observed upon adjustment for possible confounders (e.g., cell-type proportions). Conclusions: Our findings show that oligodendrocyte proportions positively influence epigenetic age acceleration across brain regions and highlight the need to further investigate this in ageing and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artifacts can be deceiving: The actual location of deep brain stimulation electrodes differs from the artifact seen on magnetic resonance images</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a common treatment for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the role of neuroimaging in localizing the position of electrode contacts relative to target brain areas in order to optimize DBS programming. Among different imaging methods, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for DBS electrode localization; however, the geometrical distortion induced by the lead limits its accuracy. In this work, we investigated to what degree the difference between the actual location of the lead's tip and the location of the tip estimated from the MRI artifact varies depending on the MRI sequence parameters such as acquisition plane and phase encoding direction, as well as the lead's extracranial configuration. Accordingly, an imaging technique to increase the accuracy of lead localization was devised and discussed. Methods: We designed and constructed an anthropomorphic phantom with an implanted DBS system following 18 clinically relevant configurations. The phantom was scanned at a Siemens 1.5 Tesla Aera scanner using a T1MPRAGE sequence optimized for clinical use and a T1TSE sequence optimized for research purposes. We varied slice acquisition plane and phase encoding direction and calculated the distance between the caudal tip of the DBS lead MRI artifact and the actual tip of the lead, as estimated from MRI reference markers. Results: Imaging parameters and lead configuration substantially altered the difference in the depth of the lead within its MRI artifact on the scale of several millimeters - with a difference as large as 4.99 millimeters. The actual tip of the DBS lead was found to be consistently more rostral than the tip estimated from the MR image artifact. The smallest difference between the tip of the DBS lead and the tip of the MRI artifact using the clinically relevant sequence (i.e., T1MPRAGE) was found with the sagittal acquisition plane and anterior-posterior phase encoding direction. Discussion/Conclusion: The actual tip of an implanted DBS lead is located up to several millimeters rostral to the tip of the lead's artifact on postoperative MR images. This distance depends on the MRI sequence parameters and the DBS system's extracranial trajectory. MRI parameters may be altered to improve this localization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NeuronBridge: an intuitive web application for neuronal morphology search across large data sets</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience research in Drosophila is benefiting from large-scale connectomics efforts using electron microscopy (EM) to reveal all the neurons in a brain and their connections. In order to exploit this knowledge base, researchers target individual neurons and study their function. Therefore, vast libraries of fly driver lines expressing fluorescent reporter genes in sets of neurons have been created and imaged using confocal light microscopy (LM). However, creating a fly line for driving gene expression within a single neuron found in the EM connectome remains a challenge, as it typically requires identifying a pair of fly lines where only the neuron of interest is expressed in both. This task and other emerging scientific workflows require finding similar neurons across large data sets imaged using different modalities. Here, we present NeuronBridge, a web application for easily and rapidly finding putative morphological matches between large datasets of neurons imaged using different modalities. We describe the functionality and construction of the NeuronBridge service, including its user-friendly GUI, data model, serverless cloud architecture, and massively parallel image search engine. NeuronBridge is openly accessible at http://neuronbridge.janelia.org/.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimating functional EEG sources using topographical templates</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common and inexpensive method to record neural activity in humans. However, it lacks spatial resolution making it difficult to determine which areas of the brain are responsible for the observed EEG response. Here we present a new easy-to-use method that relies on EEG topographical templates. Using MRI and fMRI scans of 50 participants, we simulated how the activity in each visual area appears on the scalp and averaged this signal to produce functionally defined EEG templates. Once created, these templates can be used to estimate how much each visual area contributes to the observed EEG activity. We tested this method on extensive simulations and on real data. The proposed procedure is as good as bespoke individual source localization methods and has several strengths. First, because it does not rely on individual brain scans, it is inexpensive and can be used on any EEG dataset, past or present. Second, the results are readily interpretable in terms of functional brain regions and can be compared across neuroimaging techniques. Finally, this method is easy to understand, simple to use, and expandable to other brain sources. We thus expect it to be of wide interest to EEG users.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Establishment of Transgenic Fluorescent Mice for Screening Synaptogenic Adhesion Molecules</a></h4>

              
                Synapse is the fundamental structure for neurons to transmit information between cells. The proper synapse formation is crucial for developing neural circuits and cognitive functions of the brain. The aberrant synapse formation has been proved to cause many neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are thought to play a major role in achieving mechanistic cell-cell recognition and initiating synapse formation via trans-synaptic interactions. Although several synaptic CAMs, such as neurexins, neuroligins, SynCAMs, and LRRTMs, have been identified as synaptogenic molecules, these molecules so far as we know cannot fully explain the mechanism of synapse formation. There should be other synaptogenic adhesion molecules that remain undiscovered. Artificial synapse formation (ASF) assays, the commonly used method for screening synaptogenesis molecules, is time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the long-lasting immunostaining step. To skip this step, we generated synaptotagmin 1-tdTomato (Syt1-TDT) transgenic mice by inserting the tdTomato-fused synaptotagmin 1 coding sequence into the genome of C57BL/6J mice. In the brain of Syt1-TDT transgenic mice, the Syt1-TDT signals were widely observed in different areas. In the cultured hippocampal neurons, the Syt1-TDT signals merged with several synaptic markers, suggesting the well synaptic localization of Syt1-TDT. Compared to the wild-type (WT) mouse neurons, cultured hippocampal neurons from Syt1-TDT transgenic mice presented normal synaptic neurotransmission. In ASF assays, neurons from Syt1-TDT transgenic mice could form synaptic connections with HEK293T cells expressing neuroligin2, LRRTM2, and Slitrk2 without immunostaining. Therefore, our work suggested that the Syt1-TDT transgenic mice with the ability to label synapses by tdTomato will be a convenient tool for screening synaptogenic molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Apicosome: newly identified cell-type-specific organelle in mouse cochlear and vestibular hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear are highly specialized sensory receptors for sound waves and acceleration of body movements; these cells can perform their specialized functions because of their distinctive morphology and some unique organelles that they harbor. Here, we report a serendipitous identification in the mouse of a hair-cell-specific organelle, which we name "apicosome." The apicosome was recognized by anti-FLRT1 antibodies but contains no FLRT1, and the organelle presents several distinctive characteristics: (1) the apicosome typically appears as a single entity (~500 nm in diameter), but occasionally as two entities, in hair cells; (2) it first appears in the subapical region at the neural side at embryonic day (E) 17-18 in cochlear hair cells, subsequently descends to the perinuclear region during the first postnatal week, and completely disappears around postnatal day (P) 10; (3) in vestibular hair cells, it can be detected in the subapical region of neonatal (P3) cells and persists in adult hair cells although it becomes smaller and more distant from the subapical region; (4) the timing of apicosome translocation and disappearance during development is correlated in kinocilium maintenance; (5) the organelle is potentially associated with microtubules; and (6) the appearance of the apicosome is irregular in supernumerary hair cells and this is likely linked to anomalous lateral inhibition. Thus, our study identifies a previously undescribed organelle in sensory hair cells and lays the foundation for further characterization of this specialized structure potentially linked to hair-cell development and morphogenesis

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent NMDA receptor function is regulated by the Amyloid Precursor Protein</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critical for the maturation and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. In the hippocampus, NMDARs mainly contain GluN2A and/or GluN2B regulatory subunits. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has emerged as a putative regulator of NMDARs, but the impact of this interaction to their function is largely unknown. By combining patch-clamp electrophysiology and molecular approaches, we unravel a dual mechanism by which APP controls GluN2B-NMDARs, depending on the life stage. We show that APP is highly abundant specifically at the postnatal postsynapse. It interacts with GluN2B-NMDARs, controlling its synaptic content and mediated currents, both in infant mice and primary neuronal cultures. Upon aging, the APP amyloidogenic derived C-terminal fragments, rather than APP full length, contribute to aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR currents. Accordingly, we found that the APP processing is increased upon aging, both in mice and human brain, and interfering with this mechanism normalized the aberrant currents. While the first mechanism might be essential for synaptic maturation during development, the latter could contribute to age-related synaptic impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Agency and Expectations in Pain Treatment: An Investigation of the Active Inference Model</a></h4>

              
                The fact that we cannot tickle ourselves is traditionally explained by the attenuation of somatosensation by predictions from a forward model of self-generated movements. Alternatively, it has been suggested within the framework of active inference that Bayes-optimal reduction of sensory precision can explain this phenomenon. Combining a pain paradigm with stimulus-related expectations allows to compare both models through predictions from the Bayesian account of expectation-based hypoalgesia, where pain is influenced by the precisions of somatosensation and expectation. In two experiments, heat pain was sham-treated either externally or by the subject, while a cue created higher or lower treatment expectations. Both experiments revealed greater pain relief under self-treatment and high treatment expectations. Electroencephalography revealed a modulation of theta-to-beta frequencies linked to agency and top-down modulations of pain perception. Computational modeling showed that this is better explained by an attenuation of somatosensation than a downregulation of somatosensation precision, favoring the forward model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">mTORC1 hyperactivation causes sensory integration deficits due to habenula impairment</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an integration hub for extracellular and intracellular signals necessary for proper brain development. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 is found in many developmental diseases, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Atypical reactivity to sensory stimuli is often found in patients with ASD. The most frequent hereditary cause of ASD is Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), in which inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes result in hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway. We have discovered that the zebrafish model of TSC, tsc2vu242/vu242 mutants lack light preference, a behavior requiring integration of multiple sensory inputs. Here, we show that the lack of light preference in tsc2vu242/vu242 zebrafish is caused by aberrant sensory integration of light stimuli in the left dorsal habenula. Single-cell calcium imaging analysis revealed that tsc2vu242/vu242 fish showed impaired function of the left dorsal habenula, in which neurons exhibited higher activity and lacked habituation to the light stimuli resulting in atypical response to light. Lack of light-preference behavior and abnormal neuronal activity in the left dorsal habenula were rescued by rapamycin, indicating that hyperactive mTorC1 causes aberrant habenula function and impaired sensory integration resulting in a lack of light preference. Our results link sensory integration deficits seen in TSC patients suffering from ASD with hyperactive mTORC1 and suggest that mTORC1 hyperactivity contributes to atypical reactivity to sensory stimuli in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuomotor phase-locked loop reproduces elliptic hand trajectories across different rhythms</a></h4>

              
                A well-known phenomenon in human hand movement is the correlation between speed and curvature, also known as the speed-curvature power law (V{approx}kC{beta}). In drawing elliptic shapes, the exponent is often found to be {beta} {approx} -1/3, however it is not clear why the power law appears and why the exponent is near -1/3. More fundamentally, it is not clear how do people track elliptic targets. In answering these questions, I've analyzed trajectories of participants' cursors while they tracked visual targets moving along elliptical paths, across different target speed profiles and cycle frequencies. The speed-curvature power law emerged when drawing ellipses at about 1 Hz or faster, regardless of the target speed profile, and it did not emerge for lower frequency movements. Analysis of the position frequency spectrum shows that the target-cursor trajectory transformation may be seen as a low-pass filter. Comparison of different hypothetical salient features of the visual field shows that phase difference (angular difference between the cursor and the target) and size difference (difference in the sizes of the elliptic paths) are the features most likely used in the task. The next experiment confirmed that phase and size difference could be controlled variables because participants kept them stable even under direct pseudorandom disturbances. A numerical model simulating the sensorimotor processes of the participant, similar to a phase-locked loop, using the visual features of phase and size difference as controlled variables, performed the same target tracking tasks as the participants. When fitted, the model closely replicated position and speed profiles of the participants across all trials, as well as the emergence of the power law at high frequencies. The model also reproduced the trajectories of participants in the experiment with direct pseudorandom disturbances. In conclusion (1) the speed-curvature power law emerges as a side effect of movement system properties, namely low-pass filtering in the sensorimotor loop; (2) people could be tracking elliptical targets by varying the frequency and amplitude of an internal pattern generator until the produced phase and shape size match the target's phase and shape size. The model generates new hypotheses about the neural mechanisms of rhythmic movement control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoids Activate the Insulin Pathway to Modulate Mobilization of Cholesterol in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans requires exogenous cholesterol to survive and its depletion leads to early development arrest. Thus, tight regulation of cholesterol storage and distribution within the organism is critical. Previously, we demonstrated that the endocannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) plays a key role in C. elegans modulating sterol mobilization, but the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that mutations in the ocr-2 and osm-9 genes coding for transient receptors potential V (TRPV) ion channels, dramatically reduces the effect of 2-AG in cholesterol mobilization. Through genetic analysis combined with the rescuing of larval arrest induced by sterol starvation we found that the insulin/IGF-1signaling (IIS) pathway and UNC-31/CAPS, a calcium-activated regulator of neural dense-core vesicles release, are essential for 2-AG-mediated stimulation of cholesterol mobilization. These findings indicate that 2-AG-dependent cholesterol trafficking requires the release of insulin peptides and signaling through the DAF-2 insulin receptor. These results suggest that 2-AG acts as an endogenous modulator of TRPV signal transduction to control intracellular sterol traffic through modulation of the IGF-1 signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When mechanical engineering inspired from physiology improves postural-related somatosensory processes</a></h4>

              
                Being the first stimulated by the relative movement of foot skin and the underneath moving support surface, the plantar tactile receptors (i.e., mechanoreceptors) play an important role in the sensorimotor transformation giving rise to a postural reaction. In this light, a surface (i.e., biomimetic) complying with the characteristics of the mechanoreceptors and the skin dermatoglyphs (i.e., pattern of the ridges) should facilitate the cortical processes in response to the somatosensory stimulation involved in the balance recovery motor control. Healthy young adults (n = 21) were standing still either on a biomimetic surface or on two control surfaces (i.e., grooved or smooth), when a sudden but low acceleration of the supporting surface along the lateral direction was triggered. A shorter and greater robust evoked somatosensory response (i.e., SEP) was observed when participants were standing on the biomimetic surface. As well, a lower oscillatory response in the time-frequency domain, including a theta response (5-7 Hz) in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), was recorded with the biomimetic surface. The observed higher shear forces induced by the interaction between the feet and the biomimetic surface, during the displacement, was likely at the origin of the increased SEP. Besides, the decrease of theta power suggests that the balance task became less challenging. This interpretation was tested in a second experiment by adding a cognitive task, which should be less detrimental for the postural reaction in participants standing on a biomimetic surface. According to that hypothesis, an efficient postural reaction (i.e., shorter latency and greater amplitude) was observed for the biomimetic surface.

	<p>(1) Background: The brainstem plays an essential role in the early stage of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but it is not widely tested in clinical examinations of PD. Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) are recognized as fundamental tools in the assessment of brainstem function. The aim of our meta-analysis was to assess the abnormal findings of VEMPs in patients with PD. (2) Methods: Up to 14 February 2022, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to evaluate VEMPs in patients with PD in comparison with respective controls. The study protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022311103). (3) Results: A total of 15 studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The absence rates of VEMPs in patients with PD were significantly higher than those of control groups (cVEMP: OR = 6.77; oVEMP: OR = 13.9; mVEMP: OR = 7.52). A delayed P13 latency, a decreased peak-to-peak amplitude, and an increased AAR of cVEMP, and a delayed oVEMP P15 latency were also found in patients with PD. (4) Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicates abnormal VEMP findings in patients with PD, revealing the dysfunction of the brainstem in PD. VEMP tests, especially cVEMP tests, could be a helpful method for the early detection of PD.</p>

	<p>Background: Obesity is a condition that affects humans both physically and mentally. Moreover, many psychopathological conditions can be observed in obese patients that may threaten the positive outcomes of bariatric surgery. Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the main psychopathological correlates of obese candidates for bariatric surgery, with particular attention on the relationship between psychopathology and gender. Methods: In total, 273 candidates for bariatric surgery for obesity underwent a psychiatric evaluation using a compilation of psychometric scales: the Revised Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), the Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) and the Obesity-Related Well-Being (ORWELL 97). The sample was divided on the basis of gender and binge eating disorder (BED) severity. Comparisons between the groups were performed using an analysis of variance model (ANOVA) or a Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s chi-squared test. Further, we also divided our sample into a severe binge eating group (score &amp;amp;gt; 27), a mild to moderate group (18 &amp;amp;lt; score &amp;amp;lt; 26) and a low/no symptoms group (score &amp;amp;lt; 17). Results: Male and female subjects showed different results for the BES, with higher scores reported among women (17.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.59) compared to men (14.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.64). Women also showed higher scores across most of the SCL-90-R domains and worse outcomes in terms of quality of life. Both women and men in the severe binge eating group reported higher scores for the SCL-90-R. Conclusion: The symptoms of BED, along with body image dissatisfaction (BID), are among the most important to investigate for candidates for bariatric surgery in order to improve the surgery outcomes. Level of evidence: Level III as the evidence came from a cohort analytic study.</p>

	<p>Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare neoplasm composed of cells with immunohistochemical characteristics of mature histiocytes. It can be disseminated or localized and usually involves the skin, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. Primary involvement of the vertebral column is extremely rare. We report a 29-year-old female who presented with neck pain and had a destructive 35*43*48 mm lesion in C2 with a paravertebral extension. The initial biopsy did not lead to the correct diagnosis. She later developed dysphagia, and the anterior approach was used for tumor decompression. The diagnosis of cervical histiocytic sarcoma was made, and she underwent radiotherapy. The follow-up MRI showed a marked response to radiotherapy. Here, we report the first case of cervical HS, review all cases of vertebral HS, compare patients&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics and clinical courses, and discuss diagnostic nuances and treatment options.</p>

	<p>Patients with severe substance use disorders are often characterized by neurocognitive impairments and elevated mental health symptom load, typically associated with craving intensity and substance use relapse. There is a need to improve the predictive capabilities of when relapse occurs in order to improve substance use treatment. The current paper contains data from 19 patients (seven females) in a long-term inpatient substance use treatment setting over the course of several weeks, with up to three weekly data collections. We collected data from 252 sessions, ranging from 1 to 24 sessions per subject. The subjects reported craving, self-control, and mental health on each occasion. Before starting the repeated data collection, a baseline neuropsychological screening was performed. In this repeated-measures prospective study, the mixed-effects models with time-lagged predictors support a model of substance use craving and relapse being predicted by the baseline reaction time as well as the temporal changes and variability in mental health symptom load, self-control, and craving intensity with moderate to high effect sizes. This knowledge may contribute to more personalized risk assessments and treatments for this group of patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Definition of ‘close contacts’ in leprosy studies: protocol for a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite difficulties to document transmission pathways (assumed to be airborne), increased risk of leprosy infection has been shown for individuals living in close contact with patients. However, variations in the concept of ‘close contacts’ are used in different settings and studies. We conduct this review to identify criteria of space (location, geographical variables, distance, indoor vs outdoor), time (including frequency and duration), physical exposure (skin to skin, sexual), and relationship (familial, occupational, social) involved in the definition of ‘close contacts’ in leprosy studies. We expect this review to provide an overview of the (lack of) conceptualization of this term and its variations across settings. Primary studies and reviews are eligible for inclusion in this review. The main source of records will be the PubMed interface. Secondary searches will be conducted in Google Scholar, as well as through the reference lists of selected publications. The search strategy is based on the combination of the condition of interest (leprosy) and the concept under study (‘contact’). The findings of this review will be presented using thematic narrative synthesis, tables, and figures. The protocol is written in line with the Prisma Extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">In Vivo Optogenetics Reveals Control of Cochlear Electromechanical Responses by Supporting Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cochlear sensitivity, essential for communication and exploiting the acoustic environment, results from sensory-motor outer hair cells (OHCs) operating in a structural scaffold of supporting cells and extracellular cortilymph within the organ of Corti (OoC). Cochlear sensitivity control is hypothesized to involve interaction between the OHCs and OoC supporting cells (e.g., Deiters' cells [DCs] and outer pillar cells [OPCs]), but this has never been established <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we conditionally expressed channelrhodopsins (ChR2) specifically in male and female mouse DCs and OPCs. Illumination of the OoC activated the nonselective ChR2 cation conductance and depolarized DCs when measured <I>in vivo</I> and in isolated OoC. Measurements of sound-induced cochlear mechanical and electrical responses revealed that OoC illumination suppressed the normal functions of OoC supporting cells transiently and reversibly. OoC illumination blocked normally occurring continuous minor adjustments of tone-evoked basilar membrane displacements over their entire dynamic range and OHC voltage responses to tones at levels and frequencies subject to cochlear amplification. OoC illumination altered the OHC mechanoelectrical transduction conductance operating point, which reversed the asymmetry of OHC voltage responses to high level tones. OoC illumination accelerated recovery from temporary loud sound-induced acoustic desensitization. We concluded that DCs and OPCs are involved in both the control of cochlear responses (which are essential for normal hearing) and the recovery from temporary acoustic desensitization. This is the first direct <I>in vivo</I> evidence for the interdependency of the structural, mechanical, and electrochemical arrangements of OHCs and OoC supporting cells that together provide fine control of cochlear responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A striking feature of the mammalian cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, is the cellular architecture and supporting cell arrangement that provides a structural scaffold for the sensory-motor outer hair cells. The role of the supporting cell scaffold, however, has never been elucidated <I>in vivo</I>, although <I>in vitro</I> and modeling studies indicate the scaffold is involved in exchange of forces between the outer hair cells and the organ of Corti. We used <I>in vivo</I> techniques, including optogenetics, that do not disrupt arrangements between the outer hair cells and supporting cells, but selectively, transiently, and reversibly interfere with supporting cell normal function. We revealed the supporting cells provide continuous adjustment of cochlear sensitivity, which is instrumental in normal hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Membrane Stretch Gates NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>NMDARs are ionotropic glutamate receptors widely expressed in the CNS, where they mediate phenomena as diverse as neurotransmission, information processing, synaptogenesis, and cellular toxicity. They function as glutamate-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels, which require glycine as coagonist, and can be modulated by many diffusible ligands and cellular cues, including mechanical stimuli. Previously, we found that, in cultured astrocytes, shear stress initiates NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the absence of added agonists, suggesting that more than being mechanosensitive, NMDARs may be mechanically activated. Here, we used controlled expression of rat recombinant receptors and noninvasive on-cell single-channel current recordings to show that mild membrane stretch can substitute for the neurotransmitter glutamate in gating NMDAR currents. Notably, stretch-activated currents maintained the hallmark features of the glutamate-gated currents, including glycine-requirement, large unitary conductance, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> blockade. Further, we found that the stretch-gated current required the receptor's intracellular domain. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical forces can gate endogenous NMDAR currents even in the absence of synaptic glutamate release, which has important implications for understanding mechanotransduction and the physiological and pathologic effects of mechanical forces on cells of the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that, in addition to enhancing currents elicited with low agonist concentrations, membrane stretch can gate NMDARs in the absence of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Stretch-gated currents have the principal hallmarks of the glutamate-gated currents, including requirement for glycine, large Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block. Therefore, results suggest that mechanical forces can initiate cellular processes presently attributed to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as synaptic plasticity and cytotoxicity. Given the ubiquitous presence of mechanical forces in the CNS, this discovery identifies NMDARs as possibly important mechanotransducers during development and across the lifespan, and during pathologic processes, such as those associated with traumatic brain injuries, shaken infant syndrome, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Graded Variation in T1w/T2w Ratio during Adolescence: Measurement, Caveats, and Implications for Development of Cortical Myelin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adolescence is characterized by the maturation of cortical microstructure and connectivity supporting complex cognition and behavior. Axonal myelination influences brain connectivity during development by enhancing neural signaling speed and inhibiting plasticity. However, the maturational timing of cortical myelination during human adolescence remains poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in high-resolution cortical T1w/T2w mapping methods, including principled correction of B1+ transmit field effects, using data from the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D; <I>N</I> = 628, ages 8&ndash;21). We characterize microstructural changes relevant to myelination by estimating age-related differences in T1w/T2w throughout the cerebral neocortex from childhood to early adulthood. We apply Bayesian spline models and clustering analysis to demonstrate graded variation in age-dependent cortical T1w/T2w differences that are correlated with the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis of cortical organization reported by others. In sensorimotor areas, T1w/T2w ratio measures start at high levels at early ages, increase at a fast pace, and decelerate at later ages (18&ndash;21). In intermediate multimodal areas along the S-A axis, T1w/T2w starts at intermediate levels and increases linearly at an intermediate pace. In transmodal/paralimbic association areas, T1w/T2w starts at low levels and increases linearly at the slowest pace. These data provide evidence for graded variation of the T1w/T2w ratio along the S-A axis that may reflect cortical myelination changes during adolescence underlying the development of complex information processing and psychological functioning. We discuss the implications of these results as well as caveats in interpreting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based estimates of myelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin is a lipid membrane that is essential to healthy brain function. Myelin wraps axons to increase neural signaling speed, enabling complex neuronal functioning underlying learning and cognition. Here, we characterize the developmental timing of myelination across the cerebral cortex during adolescence using a noninvasive proxy measure, T1w/T2w mapping. Our results provide new evidence demonstrating graded variation across the cortex in the timing of T1w/T2w changes during adolescence, with rapid T1w/T2w increases in lower-order sensory areas and gradual T1w/T2w increases in higher-order association areas. This spatial pattern of microstructural brain development closely parallels the sensorimotor-to-association axis of cortical organization and plasticity during ontogeny.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inputs to the Sleep Homeostat Originate Outside the Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The need to sleep is sensed and discharged in a poorly understood process that is homeostatically controlled over time. In flies, different contributions to this process have been attributed to peripheral ppk and central brain neurons, with the former serving as hypothetical inputs to the sleep homeostat and the latter reportedly serving as the homeostat itself. Here we re-evaluate these distinctions in light of new findings using female flies. First, activating neurons targeted by published ppk and brain drivers elicits similar phenotypes, namely, sleep deprivation followed by rebound sleep. Second, inhibiting activity or synaptic output with one type of driver suppresses sleep homeostasis induced using the other type of driver. Third, drivers previously used to implicate central neurons in sleep homeostasis unexpectedly also label ppk neurons. Fourth, activating only this subset of colabeled neurons is sufficient to elicit sleep homeostasis. Thus, many published contributions of central neurons to sleep homeostasis can be explained by previously unrecognized expression of brain drivers in peripheral ppk neurons, most likely those in the legs, which promote walking. Last, we show that activation of certain non-ppk neurons can also induce sleep homeostasis. Notably, axons of these as well as ppk neurons terminate in the same ventral brain region, suggesting that a previously undefined neural circuit element of a sleep homeostat may lie nearby.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The biological needs that sleep fulfills are unknown, but they are reflected by the ability of an animal to compensate for prior sleep loss in a process called sleep homeostasis. Researchers have searched for the neural circuitry that comprises the sleep homeostat so that the information it conveys can shed light on the nature of sleep need. Here we demonstrate that neurons originating outside of the brain are responsible for phenotypes previously attributed to the proposed central brain sleep homeostat in flies. Our results support a revised neural circuit model for sensing and discharging sleep need in which peripheral inputs connect to a sleep homeostat through previously unrecognized neural circuit elements in the ventral brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Resting-State fMRI-Based Screening of Deschloroclozapine in Rhesus Macaques Predicts Dosage-Dependent Behavioral Effects</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemogenetic techniques, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), enable transient, reversible, and minimally invasive manipulation of neural activity <I>in vivo</I>. Their development in nonhuman primates is essential for uncovering neural circuits contributing to cognitive functions and their translation to humans. One key issue that has delayed the development of chemogenetic techniques in primates is the lack of an accessible drug-screening method. Here, we use resting-state fMRI, a noninvasive neuroimaging tool, to assess the impact of deschloroclozapine (DCZ) on brainwide resting-state functional connectivity in 7 rhesus macaques (6 males and 1 female) without DREADDs. We found that systemic administration of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ did not alter the resting-state functional connectivity. Conversely, 0.3 mg/kg of DCZ was associated with a prominent increase in functional connectivity that was mainly confined to the connections of frontal regions. Additional behavioral tests confirmed a negligible impact of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ on socio-emotional behaviors as well as on reaction time in a probabilistic learning task; 0.3 mg/kg DCZ did, however, slow responses in the probabilistic learning task, suggesting attentional or motivational deficits associated with hyperconnectivity in fronto-temporo-parietal networks. Our study highlights both the excellent selectivity of DCZ as a DREADD actuator, and the side effects of its excess dosage. The results demonstrate the translational value of resting-state fMRI as a drug-screening tool to accelerate the development of chemogenetics in primates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemogenetics, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), can afford control over neural activity with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Accelerating the translation of chemogenetic neuromodulation from rodents to primates requires an approach to screen novel DREADD actuators <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we assessed brainwide activity in response to a DREADD actuator deschloroclozapine (DCZ) using resting-state fMRI in macaque monkeys. We demonstrated that low-dose DCZ (0.1 mg/kg) did not change whole-brain functional connectivity or affective behaviors, while a higher dose (0.3 mg/kg) altered frontal functional connectivity and slowed response in a learning task. Our study highlights the excellent selectivity of DCZ at proper dosing, and demonstrates the utility of resting-state fMRI to screen novel chemogenetic actuators in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rewarded Extinction Increases Amygdalar Connectivity and Stabilizes Long-Term Memory Traces in the vmPFC</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurobiological evidence in rodents indicates that threat extinction incorporates reward neurocircuitry. Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study with both female and male participants, we compared counterconditioning (CC; a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction at recent (24 h) and remote (approximately one month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, rewarded extinction diminished 24-h relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One month later, the retrieval of both standard-extinction and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-h and one-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prevalent treatments for pathologic fear and anxiety are based on the principles of Pavlovian extinction. Unfortunately, extinction forms weak memories that only temporarily inhibit the retrieval of threat associations. Thus, to increase the translational relevance of extinction research, it is critical to investigate whether extinction can be augmented to form a more enduring memory, especially after long intervals. Here, we used a multiday fMRI paradigm in humans to compare the short-term and long-term neurobehavioral effects of aversive-to-appetitive counterconditioning (CC), a form of augmented extinction. Our results provide novel evidence that including an appetitive stimulus during extinction can reduce short-term threat relapse and stabilize the memory trace of extinction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), for at least one month after learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rat Anterior Cingulate Cortex Continuously Signals Decision Variables in a Patch Foraging Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>In patch foraging tasks, animals must decide whether to remain with a depleting resource or to leave it in search of a potentially better source of reward. In such tasks, animals consistently follow the general predictions of optimal foraging theory (the marginal value theorem; MVT): to leave a patch when the reward rate in the current patch depletes to the average reward rate across patches. Prior studies implicate an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in foraging decisions based on MVT: within single trials, ACC activity increases immediately preceding foraging decisions, and across trials, these dynamics are modulated as the value of staying in the patch depletes to the average reward rate. Here, we test whether these activity patterns reflect dynamic encoding of decision-variables and whether these signals are directly involved in decision-making. We developed a leaky accumulator model based on the MVT that generates estimates of decision variables within and across trials, and tested model predictions against ACC activity recorded from male rats performing a patch foraging task. Model predicted changes in MVT decision variables closely matched rat ACC activity. Next, we pharmacologically inactivated ACC in male rats to test the contribution of these signals to decision-making. ACC inactivation had a profound effect on rats' foraging decisions and response times (RTs) yet rats still followed the MVT decision rule. These findings indicate that the ACC encodes foraging-related variables for reasons unrelated to patch-leaving decisions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to make adaptive patch-foraging decisions, to remain with a depleting resource or search for better alternatives, is critical to animal well-being. Previous studies have found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is modulated at different points in the foraging decision process, raising questions about whether the ACC guides ongoing decisions or serves a more general purpose of regulating cognitive control. To investigate the function of the ACC in foraging, the present study developed a dynamic model of behavior and neural activity, and tested model predictions using recordings and inactivation of ACC. Findings revealed that ACC continuously signals decision variables but that these signals are more likely used to monitor and regulate ongoing processes than to guide foraging decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Time Course of Language Production as Revealed by Pattern Classification of MEG Sensor Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Language production involves a complex set of computations, from conceptualization to articulation, which are thought to engage cascading neural events in the language network. However, recent neuromagnetic evidence suggests simultaneous meaning-to-speech mapping in picture naming tasks, as indexed by early parallel activation of frontotemporal regions to lexical semantic, phonological, and articulatory information. Here we investigate the time course of word production, asking to what extent such "earliness" is a distinctive property of the associated spatiotemporal dynamics. Using MEG, we recorded the neural signals of 34 human subjects (26 males) overtly naming 134 images from four semantic object categories (animals, foods, tools, clothes). Within each category, we covaried word length, as quantified by the number of syllables contained in a word, and phonological neighborhood density to target lexical and post-lexical phonological/phonetic processes. Multivariate pattern analyses searchlights in sensor space distinguished the stimulus-locked spatiotemporal responses to object categories early on, from 150 to 250 ms after picture onset, whereas word length was decoded in left frontotemporal sensors at 250-350 ms, followed by the latency of phonological neighborhood density (350-450 ms). Our results suggest a progression of neural activity from posterior to anterior language regions for the semantic and phonological/phonetic computations preparing overt speech, thus supporting serial cascading models of word production.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Current psycholinguistic models make divergent predictions on how a preverbal message is mapped onto articulatory output during the language planning. Serial models predict a cascading sequence of hierarchically organized neural computations from conceptualization to articulation. In contrast, parallel models posit early simultaneous activation of multiple conceptual, phonological, and articulatory information in the language system. Here we asked whether such earliness is a distinctive property of the neural dynamics of word production. The combination of the millisecond precision of MEG with multivariate pattern analyses revealed subsequent onset times for the neural events supporting semantic and phonological/phonetic operations, progressing from posterior occipitotemporal to frontal sensor areas. The findings bring new insights for refining current theories of language production.</p>
