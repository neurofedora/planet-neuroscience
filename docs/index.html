              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">“Exclusivity” and quantifier float in bakari [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents a descriptive study that analyzes the semantic meaning of Toritate focus particle bakari. Previous studies reported that, although bakari expresses exclusivity, it is characterized by the fact that it permits non-applicable cases, thereby drawing the conclusion that the meaning of bakari is not exclusivity. This paper argues that bakari does indeed denote “exclusivity” as bakari is supported by the phenomenon that non-applicable cases are unacceptable when bakari co-occurs with floating quantifiers. Considering existing research on this subject, the following was observed. Even though the subjective set, as established by the speaker’s past experiences to interpret the meaning of bakari, may not be consistent with the real world, the number of events that form the said set match the number of real-world events when bakari co-occurs with floating quantifiers due to the characteristics of floating quantifiers. In such cases, bakari does not permit non-applicable cases. The interpretation that permits non-applicable cases applies to situations where the set established by the speaker is fixed at a narrower range than the real world, and the non-applicable cases exist outside the set. We thus conclude that bakari denotes “exclusivity” that does not permit non-applicable cases.

	<p>Image segmentation still represents an active area of research since no universal solution can be identified. Traditional image segmentation algorithms are problem-specific and limited in scope. On the other hand, machine learning offers an alternative paradigm where predefined features are combined into different classifiers, providing pixel-level classification and segmentation. However, machine learning only can not address the question as to which features are appropriate for a certain classification problem. The article presents an automated image segmentation and classification platform, called Active Segmentation, which is based on ImageJ. The platform integrates expert domain knowledge, providing partial ground truth, with geometrical feature extraction based on multi-scale signal processing combined with machine learning. The approach in image segmentation is exemplified on the ISBI 2012 image segmentation challenge data set. As a second application we demonstrate whole image classification functionality based on the same principles. The approach is exemplified using the HeLa and HEp-2 data sets. Obtained results indicate that feature space enrichment properly balanced with feature selection functionality can achieve performance comparable to deep learning approaches. In summary, differential geometry can substantially improve the outcome of machine learning since it can enrich the underlying feature space with new geometrical invariant objects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reframing organizations in the digital age: A qualitative study exploring institutional social media adoption involving emergency physicians and other researchers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social media is changing the modern academic landscape; this study sought to explore how organizational structures support or inhibit the harnessing of social media use in academic contexts and knowledge translation. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using framework analysis based on the Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model—structural, human resources, political and symbolic. The research team used the snowball sampling technique to recruit participants following the completion of each participant’s semi-structured interview. A member check was completed to ensure rigour. Results: 16 social media educators and experts from several countries participated in the study. Study findings showed that within the Structural Frame, participants’ organizations were reported to have with diverse hierarchical structures, ranging hospital-based (strict), education institutional-based and online only groups (malleable). The Human Resources Frame revealed that most participants’ social media organizations operated on unpaid volunteer staff. The training of these staff was primarily via role-modeling and mentorship. Regarding the Political Frame, social media helped participants accumulate scholarly currency and influence within their field of practice. The Symbolic Frame showed a wide range of traditional to non-traditional organizational supports, which interacted with both intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. Conclusions: Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model framework may serve as an effective guideline for academic leaders who wish to strategically implement or enhance social media use into their organizations. The key insights that we have gained from our participants are how new emerging forms of scholarly pursuits can be more effectively enabled or hindered by the attributes of the organization within which these are occurring.

                Background: The biomaterials engineering goal is to manufacture a biocompatible scaffold that adequately supports or improves tissue regeneration after implantation of the biomaterial in the injured area. Many requirements are demanded for a biomaterial, such as biocompatibility, elasticity, degradation time, and a very important factor is its cost of importation or synthesis, making its application inaccessible to some countries. Studies about biomaterials market show that Polylactic acid (PLLA) is one of the most used polymers, but expensive to produce. It becomes important to prove the biocompatibility of the new PLLA and to find strategies to produce biocompatible biopolymers at an acceptable production cost. Methods: In this work, the polylactic acid biomaterial was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization. The polymer was submitted to initial in vivo biocompatibility studies in 12 New Zealand female rabbits, assigned to two groups: (1) Lesion and PLLA group (n = 6), (2) Lesion No PLLA group (n = 6). Each group was divided into two subgroups at six and nine months post-surgical time. Before euthanasia clinical and biochemical studies were performed and after that tomographic (CT), histological (Hematoxylin and Eosin and Masson's trichrome) and histomorphometric analyses were performed to evaluate the injury site and prove biocompatibility. The final cost of this polymer was analyzed. Results: The statistical studies of hemogram and hepatocyte enzymes, showed that there were no significant differences between the groups for any of the times studied, in any of the variables considered and the results of CT and histology showed that there was an important process of neoregeneration. The cost analysis showed the biopolymer synthesis is between R$3,06 - R$5,49 cheaper than the import cost. Conclusions: It was possible to synthesize the PLLA biopolymer by cyclic ring opening, which proved to be biocompatible, potential osteoregenerative and cheaper than other imported biopolymers.

                Background: Customer churn is a term that refers to the rate at which customers leave the business. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor, cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service, or discontinuing all contact with a brand due to insufficient touchpoints. Long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. A rise of 5% in customer satisfaction is followed by a 95% increase in sales. By analysing past behaviour, companies can anticipate future revenue. This article will look at which variables in the Net Promoter Score (NPS) dataset influence customer churn in Malaysia's telecommunications industry.  The aim of This study was to identify the factors behind customer churn and propose a churn prediction framework currently lacking in the telecommunications industry.   Methods: This study applied data mining techniques to the NPS dataset from a Malaysian telecommunications company in September 2019 and September 2020, analysing 7776 records with 30 fields to determine which variables were significant for the churn prediction model. We developed a propensity for customer churn using the Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine using 33 variables.   Results: Customer churn is elevated for customers with a low NPS. However, an immediate helpdesk can act as a neutral party to ensure that the customer needs are met and to determine an employee's ability to obtain customer satisfaction.   Conclusions: It can be concluded that CART has the most accurate churn prediction (98%). However, the research is prohibited from accessing personal customer information under Malaysia's data protection policy. Results are expected for other businesses to measure potential customer churn using NPS scores to gather customer feedback.

                Background: Eating habits are formed from childhood and develop into adulthood. Unhealthy eating habits will persist into adulthood and can lead  to various diseases. Healthy eating and behaviour should be taught using  engaging tools. The study aims to pilot nutrition education using the game-based learning approach, implementing a specially designed learning board game entitled "Gastronot". Methods: A mixed-method study was used in two stages. The first stage was an FGD with 14 informants and in-depth interviews with six informants to develop the game. The second stage was the game's development, and a pre and post-test were conducted on 88 children to evaluate the game—the study was conducted from August 2019 to July 2020. Results: Results showed almost half the children (49%) never heard about Balanced Nutrition Diet Pyramid. There was a significant difference between respondents' knowledge before and after playing the game with a p-value of 0.021. The game was able to engage participants in the active learning process. Conclusions: We concluded that the game-based learning utilizing the Gastronot board game demonstrated good results as a method for teaching primary school students about food and healthy eating habits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fuminari Miura, Ka Yin Leung, Don Klinkenberg, Kylie E. C. Ainslie, Jacco Wallinga</p>

For the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest. We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity (the next generation matrix), and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Roles of mTOR in thoracic aortopathy understood by complex intracellular signaling interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana C. Estrada, Linda Irons, Bruno V. Rego, Guangxin Li, George Tellides, Jay D. Humphrey</p>

Thoracic aortopathy–aneurysm, dissection, and rupture–is increasingly responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Advances in medical genetics and imaging have improved diagnosis and thus enabled earlier prophylactic surgical intervention in many cases. There remains a pressing need, however, to understand better the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms with the hope of finding robust pharmacotherapies. Diverse studies in patients and mouse models of aortopathy have revealed critical changes in multiple smooth muscle cell signaling pathways that associate with disease, yet integrating information across studies and models has remained challenging. We present a new quantitative network model that includes many of the key smooth muscle cell signaling pathways and validate the model using a detailed data set that focuses on hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and its inhibition using rapamycin. We show that the model can be parameterized to capture the primary experimental findings both qualitatively and quantitatively. We further show that simulating a population of cells by varying receptor reaction weights leads to distinct proteomic clusters within the population, and that these clusters emerge due to a bistable switch driven by positive feedback in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Identifying the epitope of an antibody is a key step in understanding its function and its potential as a therapeutic. Sequence-based clonal clustering can identify antibodies with similar epitope complementarity, however, antibodies from markedly different lineages but with similar structures can engage the same epitope. We describe a novel computational method for epitope profiling based on structural modelling and clustering. Using the method, we demonstrate that sequence dissimilar but functionally similar antibodies can be found across the Coronavirus Antibody Database, with high accuracy (92% of antibodies in multiple-occupancy structural clusters bind to consistent domains). Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than is suggested by sequence-based approaches. Our results show that applying structural analytics to large class-specific antibody databases will enable high confidence structure-function relationships to be drawn, yielding new opportunities to identify functional convergence hitherto missed by sequence-only analysis.

<i>Cis</i>-Regulatory elements (<i>cis</i>-REs) include promoters, enhancers, and insulators that regulate gene expression programs <i>via</i> binding of transcription factors. ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active <i>cis</i>-REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of <i>cis</i>-REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known <i>cis</i>-RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred <i>cis</i>-RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study <i>cis</i>-RE functions of rare cellswithout the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in <i>cis</i>-RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Viral surface geometry shapes influenza and coronavirus spike evolution through antibody pressure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Assaf Amitai</p>

The evolution of circulating viruses is shaped by their need to evade antibody response, which mainly targets the viral spike. Because of the high density of spikes on the viral surface, not all antigenic sites are targeted equally by antibodies. We offer here a geometry-based approach to predict and rank the probability of surface residues of SARS spike (S protein) and influenza H1N1 spike (hemagglutinin) to acquire antibody-escaping mutations utilizing in-silico models of viral structure. We used coarse-grained MD simulations to estimate the on-rate (targeting) of an antibody model to surface residues of the spike protein. Analyzing publicly available sequences, we found that spike surface sequence diversity of the pre-pandemic seasonal influenza H1N1 and the sarbecovirus subgenus highly correlates with our model prediction of antibody targeting. In particular, we identified an antibody-targeting gradient, which matches a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike. This identifies the role of viral surface geometry in shaping the evolution of circulating viruses. For the 2009 H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike was not observed. Our model further allowed us to identify key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike at which antibody escape mutations have now occurred. Therefore, it can inform of the likely functional role of observed mutations and predict at which residues antibody-escaping mutation might arise.

How does the brain process sensory stimuli, and decide whether to initiate locomotor behaviour? To investigate this question we develop two whole body computer models of a tadpole. The “<i>Central Nervous System</i>” (<i>CNS</i>) model uses evidence from whole-cell recording to define 2000 neurons in 12 classes to study how sensory signals from the skin initiate and stop swimming. In response to skin stimulation, it generates realistic sensory pathway spiking and shows how hindbrain sensory memory populations on each side can compete to initiate reticulospinal neuron firing and start swimming. The 3-D “<i>Virtual Tadpo</i>le” (<i>VT</i>) biomechanical model with realistic muscle innervation, body flexion, body-water interaction, and movement is then used to evaluate if motor nerve outputs from the <i>CNS model</i> can produce swimming-like movements in a volume of “water”. We find that the whole tadpole <i>VT model</i> generates reliable and realistic swimming. Combining these two models opens new perspectives for experiments.

                <p>by Han Zhuang, Tzu-Yang Huang, Daniel E. Acuna</p>

Academic graphs are essential for communicating complex scientific ideas and results. To ensure that these graphs truthfully reflect underlying data and relationships, visualization researchers have proposed several principles to guide the graph creation process. However, the extent of violations of these principles in academic publications is unknown. In this work, we develop a deep learning-based method to accurately measure violations of the proportional ink principle (AUC = 0.917), which states that the size of shaded areas in graphs should be consistent with their corresponding quantities. We apply our method to analyze a large sample of bar charts contained in 300K figures from open access publications. Our results estimate that 5% of bar charts contain proportional ink violations. Further analysis reveals that these graphical integrity issues are significantly more prevalent in some research fields, such as psychology and computer science, and some regions of the globe. Additionally, we find no temporal and seniority trends in violations. Finally, apart from openly releasing our large annotated dataset and method, we discuss how computational research integrity could be part of peer-review and the publication processes.

                <p>by Jan Ewald, Flora Rivieccio, Lukáš Radosa, Stefan Schuster, Axel A. Brakhage, Christoph Kaleta</p>

<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is an important human fungal pathogen and its conidia are constantly inhaled by humans. In immunocompromised individuals, conidia can grow out as hyphae that damage lung epithelium. The resulting invasive aspergillosis is associated with devastating mortality rates. Since infection is a race between the innate immune system and the outgrowth of <i>A. fumigatus</i> conidia, we use dynamic optimization to obtain insight into the recruitment and depletion of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Using this model, we obtain key insights into major determinants of infection outcome on host and pathogen side. On the pathogen side, we predict <i>in silico</i> and confirm <i>in vitro</i> that germination speed is an important virulence trait of fungal pathogens due to the vulnerability of conidia against host defense. On the host side, we found that epithelial cells, which have been underappreciated, play a role in fungal clearance and are potent mediators of cytokine release. Both predictions were confirmed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments on established cell lines as well as primary lung cells. Further, our model affirms the importance of neutrophils in invasive aspergillosis and underlines that the role of macrophages remains elusive. We expect that our model will contribute to improvement of treatment protocols by focusing on the critical components of immune response to fungi but also fungal virulence traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-synaptic interactions between olfactory receptor neurons, a possible key feature of odor processing in flies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mario Pannunzi, Thomas Nowotny</p>

When flies explore their environment, they encounter odors in complex, highly intermittent plumes. To navigate a plume and, for example, find food, they must solve several challenges, including reliably identifying mixtures of odorants and their intensities, and discriminating odorant mixtures emanating from a single source from odorants emitted from separate sources and just mixing in the air. Lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe is commonly understood to help solving these challenges. With a computational model of the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system, we analyze the utility of an alternative mechanism for solving them: Non-synaptic (“ephaptic”) interactions (NSIs) between olfactory receptor neurons that are stereotypically co-housed in the same sensilla.
We find that NSIs improve mixture ratio detection and plume structure sensing and do so more efficiently than the traditionally considered mechanism of lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe. The best performance is achieved when both mechanisms work in synergy. However, we also found that NSIs <i>decrease</i> the dynamic range of co-housed ORNs, especially when they have similar sensitivity to an odorant. These results shed light, from a functional perspective, on the role of NSIs, which are normally avoided between neurons, for instance by myelination.

Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability. We demonstrate that middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice leads to a strong decline in dendritic arborization of penumbral neurons. These defects were subsequently repaired by an ipsilateral recovery process requiring the actin nucleator Cobl. Ischemic stroke and excitotoxicity, caused by calpain-mediated proteolysis, significantly reduced Cobl levels. In an apparently unique manner among excitotoxicity-affected proteins, this Cobl decline was rapidly restored by increased mRNA expression and Cobl then played a pivotal role in poststroke dendritic arbor repair in peri-infarct areas. In <i>Cobl</i> knockout (KO) mice, the dendritic repair window determined to span day 2 to 4 poststroke in wild type (WT) strikingly passed without any dendritic regrowth. Instead, Cobl KO penumbral neurons of the primary motor cortex continued to show the dendritic impairments caused by stroke. Our results thereby highlight a powerful poststroke recovery process and identified causal molecular mechanisms critical during poststroke repair.

                Background: Millennials are exposed to many investment opportunities, and they have shown their interest in gaining more income via investments. One popular investment avenue is unit trusts. However, analysing unit trusts’ financial data and gaining valuable insights may not be as simple because not everyone has the required financial knowledge and adequate time to perform in-depth analytics on the numerous financial data. Furthermore, it is not easy to compile the performance of each unit trust available in Malaysia. The primary objective of this research is to identify unit trust funds that provide higher returns than their average peers via performance profiling.  Methods: This research proposed a performance profiling on Malaysia unit trust funds using the two data mining techniques, i.e., Expectation Maximisation (EM) and Apriori, to assist amateur retail investors to choose the right unit trust based on their risk tolerance. EM clustered the unit trust funds in Malaysia into several groups based on their annual financial performances. This was then followed by finding the rules associated with each cluster by applying Apriori. The resulted rules shall serve the purpose of profiling the clustered unit trust funds. Retail investors can then select their preferred unit trust funds based on the performance profile of the clusters.  Results: The yearly average total return of the financial year 2018 and 2019 was used to evaluate unit trust funds’ performance in the clusters. The evaluation results indicated that the profiling could provide valuable and insightful information to retail investors with varying risk appetites.   Conclusions: This research has demonstrated that the financial performance profiling of unit trust funds could be acquired via data mining approaches. This valuable information is crucial to unit trust investors for selecting suitable funds in investment.

                Cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus uses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) to coordinate neuronal circuit activity while simultaneously influencing the function of non-neuronal cell types. The α7 nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) subtype is highly expressed throughout the hippocampus, has the highest calcium permeability compared with other subtypes of nAChRs, and is of high therapeutic interest due to its association with a variety of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The impact of stress on the hippocampal spatial code</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal function is severely compromised by prolonged, uncontrollable stress. However, how stress alters neural representations of our surroundings and events that occur within them remains less clear. We review hippocampal place cell studies that examine how spatial coding is affected by acute and chronic stress, as well as by stress accompanying fear conditioning. Emerging data suggest that chronic stress disrupts the acuity and specificity of CA1 spatial coding, both in familiar and novel contexts, and alters hippocampal oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Learning and attention increase visual response selectivity through distinct mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Learning and attention can enhance sensory processing in cortical circuits at longer and shorter timescales. By tracking the same excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex across learning and during attention switching, Poort et al. demonstrate that distinct mechanisms underlie the enhancement of sensory processing due to learning and attention.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 13 December 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00950-1">doi:10.1038/s41593-021-00950-1</a></p>Primates seek opportunities to view novel objects even when these objects have no extrinsic reward value. Ogasawara et al. show that this novelty seeking is regulated by a temporal cortex→zona incerta pathway, rather than by dopamine neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nonlinear transient amplification in recurrent neural networks with short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                To rapidly process information, neural circuits have to amplify specific activity patterns transiently. How the brain performs this nonlinear operation remains elusive. Hebbian assemblies are one possibility whereby strong recurrent excitatory connections boost neuronal activity. However, such Hebbian amplification is often associated with dynamical slowing of network dynamics, non-transient attractor states, and pathological run-away activity. Feedback inhibition can alleviate these effects but typically linearizes responses and reduces amplification gain. Here we study nonlinear transient amplification (NTA), a plausible alternative mechanism that reconciles strong recurrent excitation with rapid amplification while avoiding the above issues. NTA has two distinct temporal phases. Initially, positive feedback excitation selectively amplifies inputs that exceed a critical threshold. Subsequently, short-term plasticity quenches the run-away dynamics into an inhibition-stabilized network state. By characterizing NTA in supralinear network models, we establish that the resulting onset transients are stimulus selective and well-suited for speedy information processing. Further, we find that excitatory-inhibitory co-tuning widens the parameter regime in which NTA is possible in the absence of persistent activity. In summary, NTA provides a parsimonious explanation for how excitatory-inhibitory co-tuning and short-term plasticity collaborate in recurrent networks to achieve transient amplification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rpl24Bst mutation suppresses colorectal cancer by promoting eEF2 phosphorylation via eEF2K</a></h4>

              
                Increased protein synthesis supports the rapid cell proliferation associated with cancer. The <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutant mouse reduces the expression of the ribosomal protein RPL24 and has been used to suppress translation and limit tumorigenesis in multiple mouse models of cancer. Here, we show that <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> also suppresses tumorigenesis and proliferation in a model of colorectal cancer (CRC) with two common patient mutations, <i>Apc</i> and <i>Kras</i>. In contrast to previous reports, <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutation has no effect on ribosomal subunit abundance but suppresses translation elongation through phosphorylation of eEF2, reducing protein synthesis by 40% in tumour cells. Ablating eEF2 phosphorylation in <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutant mice by inactivating its kinase, eEF2K, completely restores the rates of elongation and protein synthesis. Furthermore, eEF2K activity is required for the <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutant to suppress tumorigenesis. This work demonstrates that elevation of eEF2 phosphorylation is an effective means to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis with two driver mutations. This positions translation elongation as a therapeutic target in CRC, as well as in other cancers where the <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutation has a tumour suppressive effect in mouse models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse mating phenotypes impact the spread of wtf meiotic drivers in Schizosaccharomyces pombe</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic drivers are genetic elements that break Mendel's law of segregation to be transmitted into more than half of the offspring produced by a heterozygote. The success of a driver relies on outcrossing (mating between individuals from distinct lineages) because drivers gain their advantage in heterozygotes. It is, therefore, curious that <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, a species reported to rarely outcross, harbors many meiotic drivers. To address this paradox, we measured mating phenotypes in <i>S. pombe</i> natural isolates. We found that the propensity for cells from distinct clonal lineages to mate varies between natural isolates and can be affected both by cell density and by the available sexual partners. Additionally, we found that the observed levels of preferential mating between cells from the same clonal lineage can slow, but not prevent, the spread of a <i>wtf</i> meiotic driver in the absence of additional fitness costs linked to the driver. These analyses reveal parameters critical to understanding the evolution of <i>S. pombe</i> and help explain the success of meiotic drivers in this species.

                Multidimensional landscapes of regulatory genes in neuronal phenotypes at whole-brain levels in the vertebrate remain elusive. We generated single-cell transcriptomes of ~67,000 region- and glutamatergic/neuromodulator-identifiable cells from larval zebrafish brains. Hierarchical clustering based on effector gene profiles ('terminal features') distinguished major brain cell types. Sister clusters at hierarchical termini displayed similar terminal features. It was further verified by a population-level statistical method. Intriguingly, glutamatergic/GABAergic sister clusters mostly expressed distinct transcriptional factor (TF) profiles ('convergent pattern'), whereas neuromodulator-type sister clusters predominantly expressed the same TF profiles ('matched pattern'). Interestingly, glutamatergic/GABAergic clusters with similar TF profiles could also display different terminal features ('divergent pattern'). It led us to identify a library of RNA-binding proteins that differentially marked divergent pair clusters, suggesting the post-transcriptional regulation of neuron diversification. Thus, our findings reveal multidimensional landscapes of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators in whole-brain neuronal phenotypes in the zebrafish brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assembly status transition offers an avenue for activity modulation of a supramolecular enzyme</a></h4>

              
                Nature has evolved many supramolecular proteins assembled in certain, sometimes even seemingly oversophisticated, morphological manners. The rationale behind such evolutionary efforts is often poorly understood. Here, we provide atomic-resolution insights into how the dynamic building of a structurally complex enzyme with higher order symmetry offers amenability to intricate regulation. We have established the functional coupling between enzymatic activity and protein morphological states of glutamine synthetase (GS), an old multi-subunit enzyme essential for cellular nitrogen metabolism. Cryo-EM structure determination of GS in both the catalytically active and inactive assembly states allows us to reveal an unanticipated self-assembly-induced disorder-order transition paradigm, in which the remote interactions between two subcomplex entities significantly rigidify the otherwise structurally fluctuating active sites, thereby regulating activity. We further show in vivo evidences that how the enzyme morphology transitions could be modulated by cellular factors on demand. Collectively, our data present an example of how assembly status transition offers an avenue for activity modulation, and sharpens our mechanistic understanding of the complex functional and regulatory properties of supramolecular enzymes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2</a></h4>

              
                In the mouse, <i>Period-2</i> (<i>Per2</i>) expression in tissues peripheral to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) increases during sleep deprivation and at times of the day when animals are predominantly awake spontaneously, suggesting that the circadian sleep-wake distribution directly contributes to the daily rhythms in <i>Per2</i>. We found support for this hypothesis by recording sleep-wake state alongside PER2 bioluminescence in freely behaving mice, demonstrating that PER2 bioluminescence increases during spontaneous waking and decreases during sleep. The temporary reinstatement of PER2-bioluminescence rhythmicity in behaviorally arrhythmic SCN-lesioned mice submitted to daily recurring sleep deprivations substantiates our hypothesis. Mathematical modelling revealed that PER2 dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator driven by two forces: a sleep-wake-dependent force and a SCN-independent circadian force. Our work underscores the notion that in peripheral tissues the clock gene circuitry integrates sleep-wake information and could thereby contribute to behavioral adaptability to respond to homeostatic requirements.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of positive and negative selection and TCR signaling during thymic T cell development by capicua</a></h4>

              
                Central tolerance is achieved through positive and negative selection of thymocytes mediated by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling strength. Thus, dysregulation of the thymic selection process often leads to autoimmunity. Here, we show that Capicua (CIC), a transcriptional repressor that suppresses autoimmunity, controls the thymic selection process. Loss of CIC prior to T-cell lineage commitment impairs both positive and negative selection of thymocytes. CIC deficiency attenuated TCR signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) cells, as evidenced by a decrease in CD5 and phospho-ERK levels and calcium flux. We identified <i>Spry4</i>, <i>Dusp4</i>, <i>Dusp6,</i> and <i>Spred1</i> as CIC target genes that could inhibit TCR signaling in DP cells. Furthermore, impaired positive selection and TCR signaling were partially rescued in <i>Cic</i> and <i>Spry4</i> double mutant mice. Our findings indicate that CIC is a transcription factor required for thymic T cell development and suggests that CIC acts at multiple stages of T cell development and differentiation to prevent autoimmunity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9-POLD3 fusion</a></h4>

              
                Precision CRISPR gene editing relies on the cellular homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) to introduce custom DNA sequences to target sites. The HDR editing efficiency varies between cell types and genomic sites, and the sources of this variation are incompletely understood. Here, we have studied the effect of 450 DNA repair protein - Cas9 fusions on CRISPR genome editing outcomes. We find the majority of fusions to improve precision genome editing only modestly in a locus- and cell-type specific manner. We identify Cas9-POLD3 fusion that enhances editing by speeding up the initiation of DNA repair. We conclude that while DNA repair protein fusions to Cas9 can improve HDR CRISPR editing, most need to be optimized to the cell type and genomic site, highlighting the diversity of factors contributing to locus-specific genome editing outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Progressive alterations of striatal polysomal architecture in a mouse model of Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on a precise spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis due to their highly polarized morphology and their functional singularities. Consequently, alterations in protein translation have been widely related to the development and progression of various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. Here we explored the architecture of polysomes in their native brain context by performing 3D electron tomography of striatal tissue derived from a knock-in mouse model of the disease. Results showed a progressive remodelling towards a polysomal compacted architecture that parallels in time the emergence and progression of symptoms in the mouse model. The aberrant architecture is compatible with ribosome stalling phenomena and, in fact, we detected an increase in the expression of the stalling release factor eIF5A2. Polysomal sedimentation gradients showed significant excess in the accumulation of free 40S ribosomal subunits in heterozygous striatal samples. Overall the results indicate that changes in the architecture of the protein synthesis machinery might be at the basis of translational alterations associated to Huntington's disease and open new avenues for understanding disease progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid generation of ventral spinal cord-like astrocytes from human iPSCs for modeling non-cell autonomous mechanisms of lower motor neuron disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Astrocytes play important roles in the function and survival of neuronal cells. Dysfunctions of astrocytes are associated with numerous disorders and diseases of the nervous system, including motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based approaches are becoming increasingly important for the study of the mechanisms underlying the involvement of astrocytes in non-cell autonomous processes of motor neuron degeneration in ALS. These studies must account for the molecular and functional diversity among astrocytes in different regions of the brain and spinal cord. It is essential that the most pathologically-relevant astrocyte preparations are used when investigating non-cell autonomous mechanisms of either upper or lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. In this context, the main aim of this study was to establish conditions enabling rapid and robust generation of physiologically-relevant ventral spinal cord-like astrocytes that would provide an enhanced experimental model for the study of lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Methods: Neural progenitor cells with validated caudal and ventral features were derived from human iPSCs and differentiated into astrocytes, which were then characterized by examining morphology, markers of ventral spinal cord astrocytes, spontaneous and induced calcium transients, and astrogliosis markers. Results: Efficient and streamlined generation of human iPSC-derived astrocytes with molecular and biological properties similar to physiological astrocytes in the ventral spinal cord was achieved. These induced astrocytes express markers of mature ventral spinal cord astrocytes, exhibit spontaneous and ATP-induced calcium transients, and lack signs of overt activation. Conclusions: Human iPSC-derived astrocytes with ventral spinal features offer advantages over more generic astrocyte preparations for the study of both ventral spinal cord astrocyte biology and the involvement of astrocytes in mechanisms of lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

                Probing the external world is essential for eukaryotes to distinguish beneficial from pathogenic microorganisms. If it is clear that this task falls to the immune cells, recent work shows that neurons can also detect microbes, although the molecules and mechanisms involved are less characterized. In Drosophila, detection of bacteria-derived peptidoglycan by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) of the PGRP family expressed in immune cells, triggers NF-kB/IMD dependent signaling. We show here that one PGRP protein, called PGRP-LB, is expressed in some proboscis's bitter taste neurons. In vivo calcium imaging reveals that the PGRP/IMD pathway is cell-autonomously required in these neurons to transduce the PGN signal. We finally show that NF-kB/IMD pathway activation in bitter neurons influences fly behavior. This demonstrates that flies use the same bacterial elicitor and signaling module to sense bacterial presence via the peripheral nervous system and trigger an anti-bacterial response in immune-competent cells.

                While it is well-established that bone responds dynamically to mechanical loading, the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) on cranial bone composition are unclear. We hypothesized that repeated mTBI (rmTBI) would change the microstructure of cranial bones, without gross skull fractures. To address this, young adult female Piebald Viral Glaxo rats received sham, 1x, 2x or 3x closed-head mTBIs delivered at 24h intervals, using a weight drop device custom built for reproducible impact. Skull bones were collected at 2 or 10 weeks after the final injury/sham procedure, imaged by micro computed tomography and analyzed at predetermined regions of interest. In the interparietal bone, proximal to the injury site, modest increases in bone thickness was observed at 2 weeks, particularly following 3x mTBI. By 10 weeks, 2x mTBI induced a robust increase in the volume and thickness of the interparietal bone, alongside a corresponding decrease in the volume of marrow cavities in the diploe region. In contrast, neither parietal nor frontal skull samples were affected by rmTBI. Our findings demonstrate time- and location-dependent effects of rmTBI on cranial bone structure, highlighting a need to consider microstructural alterations to cranial bone when assessing the consequences of rmTBI.

                Ultrasonic vocalizations in mice have recently been widely investigated as social behavior; however, using existing sound localization systems in home cages, which allow observations of more undisturbed behavior expressions, is challenging. We introduce a novel system, named USVCAM, that uses a phased microphone array and demonstrate novel vocal interactions under a resident-intruder paradigm. The extended applicability and usability of USVCAM may facilitate investigations of social behaviors and underlying physiological mechanisms.

                During development reelin sets the pace of neocortical neurogenesis enabling in turn newborn neurons to migrate, but whether and, if so, how reelin signaling affects the adult neurogenic niches remains uncertain. We show that reelin signaling, resulting in Dab1 phosphorylation, occurs in the ependymal-subependymal zone (EZ/SEZ) of the lateral ventricles where, along with its associated rostral migratory stream (RMS), the highest density of functional ApoER2 accumulates. Mice deficient for reelin, ApoER2 or Dab1 exhibit enlarged ventricles and dysplastic RMS. Moreover, while the conditional ablation of Dab1 in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) enlarges the ventricles and impairs neuroblasts clearance from the SEZ, the transgenic misexpression of reelin in NPCs of reelin-deficient mice normalizes the ventricular lumen and the density of ependymal cilia, ameliorating in turn neuroblasts migration; consistently, intraventricular infusion of reelin reroutes neuroblasts. These results demonstrate that reelin signaling persists sustaining the germinal niche of the lateral ventricles and influencing neuroblasts migration in the adult brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two Stages of Speech Envelope Tracking in Human Auditory Cortex Modulated by Speech Intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                The envelope is essential for speech perception. Recent studies have shown that cortical activity can track the acoustic envelope. However, whether the tracking strength reflects the extent of speech intelligibility processing remains controversial. Here, using stereo-electroencephalogram (sEEG) technology, we directly recorded the activity in human auditory cortex while subjects listened to either natural or noise-vocoded speech. These two stimuli have approximately identical envelopes, but the noise-vocoded speech does not have speech intelligibility. We found two stages of envelope tracking in auditory cortex: an early high-{gamma} (60-140 Hz) power stage (delay {approx} 49 ms) that preferred the noise-vocoded speech, and a late {theta} (4-8 Hz) phase stage (delay {approx} 178 ms) that preferred the natural speech. Furthermore, the decoding performance of high-{gamma} power was better in primary auditory cortex than in non-primary auditory cortex, consistent with its short tracking delay. We also found distinct lateralization effects: high-{gamma} power envelope tracking dominated left auditory cortex, while {theta} phase showed better decoding performance in right auditory cortex. In sum, we suggested a functional dissociation between high-{gamma} power and {theta} phase: the former reflects fast and automatic processing of brief acoustic features, while the latter correlates to slow build-up processing facilitated by speech intelligibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Buffering of transcription rate by mRNA half-life is a conserved feature of Rett syndrome models</a></h4>

              
                Models of MECP2 dysfunction in Rett syndrome (RTT) assume that transcription rate changes directly correlate with altered steady-state mRNA levels. However, limited evidence suggests that transcription rate changes are buffered by poorly understood compensatory post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here we measure transcription rate and mRNA half-life changes in RTT patient neurons using RATE-seq, and reinterpret nuclear and whole-cell RNAseq from Mecp2 mice. Genes are dysregulated by changing transcription rate only or half-life only and are buffered when both are changed. We utilized classifier models to understand the direction of transcription rate changes based on gene-body DNA sequence, and combined frequencies of three dinucleotides were better predictors than contributions by CA and CG. MicroRNA and RNA-Binding Protein (RBP) motifs were enriched in 3'UTRs of genes with half-life changes. Motifs for nuclear localized RBPs were enriched on buffered genes with increased transcription rate. Our findings identify post-transcriptional mechanisms in humans and mice that alter half-life only or buffer transcription rate changes when a transcriptional modulator gene is mutated in a neurodevelopmental disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A somatosensory computation that unifies bodies and tools</a></h4>

              
                It is often claimed that tools are embodied by the user, but whether the brain actually repurposes its body-based computations to perform similar tasks with tools is not known. A fundamental body-based computation used by the somatosensory system is trilateration. Here, the location of touch on a limb is computed by integrating estimates of the distance between sensory input and its boundaries (e.g., elbow and wrist of the forearm). As evidence of this computational mechanism, tactile localization on a limb is most precise near its boundaries and lowest in the middle. If the brain repurposes trilateration to localize touch on a tool, we should observe this computational signature in behavior. In a large sample of participants, we indeed found that localizing touch on a tool produced the signature of trilateration, with highest precision close to the base and tip of the tool. A computational model of trilateration provided a good fit to the observed localization behavior. Importantly, model selection demonstrated that trilateration better explained each participant's behavior than an alternative model of localization. These results have important implications for how trilateration may be implemented by somatosensory neural populations. In sum, the present study suggests that tools are indeed embodied at a computational level, repurposing a fundamental spatial computation.

                Visual motion provides rich geometrical cues about the three-dimensional configuration the world. However, how brains decode the spatial information carried by motion signals remains poorly understood. Here, we study a collision avoidance behavior in Drosophila as a simple model of motion-based spatial vision. With simulations and psychophysics, we demonstrate that walking Drosophila exhibit a pattern of slowing to avoid collisions by exploiting the geometry of positional changes of objects on near-collision courses. This behavior requires the visual neuron LPLC1, whose tuning mirrors the behavior and whose activity drives slowing. LPLC1 pools inputs from object- and motion-detectors, and spatially biased inhibition tunes it to the geometry of collisions. Connectomic analyses identified circuitry downstream of LPLC1 that faithfully inherits its response properties. Overall, our results reveal how a small neural circuit solves a specific spatial vision task by combining distinct visual features to exploit universal geometrical constraints of the visual world.

                Gaze stabilization reflexes reduce motion blur and simplify the processing of visual information by keeping the eyes level. These reflexes typically depend on estimates of the rotational motion of the body, head, and eyes, acquired by visual or mechanosensory systems. During rapid movements, there can be insufficient time for sensory feedback systems to estimate rotational motion, and additional mechanisms are required. The solutions to this common problem likely reflect an animal's behavioral repertoire. Here, we examine gaze stabilization in three families of dipteran flies, each with distinctly different flight behaviors. Through frequency response analysis based on tethered-flight experiments, we demonstrate that fast roll oscillations of the body lead to a stable gaze in hoverflies, whereas the reflex breaks down at the same speeds in blowflies and horseflies. Surprisingly, the high-speed gaze stabilization of hoverflies does not require sensory input from the halteres, their low-latency balance organs. Instead, we show how the behavior is explained by a hybrid control system that combines a sensory-driven, active stabilization component mediated by neck muscles, and a passive component which exploits physical properties of the animal's anatomy---the mass and inertia of the head. This solution requires hoverflies to have specializations of the head-neck joint that can be employed during flight. Our comparative study highlights how species-specific control strategies have evolved to support different visually-guided flight behaviors.

                Cortical oscillations in different frequency bands have been shown to be intimately involved in exploration of environment and cognition. Here, the local field potentials in the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) were recorded simultaneously in rats during the execution of the episodic-like memory task. The power of hippocampal theta (~4-10 Hz), slow gamma (~25-50 Hz), and fast gamma oscillations (~55-100 Hz) was analyzed in all structures examined. Particular attention was paid to the theta coherence between three mentioned structures. The modulation of the power of gamma rhythms by the phase of theta cycle during the execution of the episodic-like memory test by rats was also closely studied. Healthy rats and rats one month after kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE) were examined. Paroxysmal activity in the hippocampus (high amplitude interictal spikes), excessive excitability of animals, and the death of hippocampal and dentate granular cells in rats with kainate-evoked SE were observed, which indicated the development of seizure focus in the hippocampus (epileptogenesis). One month after SE, the rats exhibited a specific impairment of episodic memory for the what-where-when triad: unlike healthy rats, epileptogenic SE animals did not identify the objects during the test. This impairment was associated with the changes in the characteristics of theta and gamma rhythms and specific violation of theta coherence and theta/gamma coupling in these structures in comparison with the healthy animals. We believe that these disturbances in the cortical areas play a role in episodic memory dysfunction in kainate-treated animals. These findings can shed light on the mechanisms of cognitive deficit during epileptogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating denoising strategies in resting-state fMRI in traumatic brain injury (EpiBioS4Rx)</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Resting-state functional MRI is increasingly used in the clinical setting and is now included in some diagnostic guidelines for severe brain injury patients. However, to ensure high-quality data, one should mitigate fMRI-related noise typical of this population. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the ability of different preprocessing strategies to mitigate noise-related signal (i.e., in-scanner movement and physiological noise) in functional connectivity of traumatic brain injury patients. Methods: We applied nine commonly used denoising strategies, combined into 17 pipelines, to 88 traumatic brain injury patients from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Anti-epileptogenic Therapy clinical trial (EpiBioS4Rx). Pipelines were evaluated by three quality control metrics across three exclusion regimes based on the participant's head movement profile. Results: While no pipeline eliminated noise effects on functional connectivity, some pipelines exhibited relatively high effectiveness depending on the exclusion regime. Once high-motion participants were excluded, the choice of denoising pipeline becomes secondary - although this strategy leads to substantial data loss. Pipelines combining spike regression with physiological regressors were the best performers, whereas pipelines that used automated data driven methods performed comparatively worse. Conclusion: In this study, we report the first large-scale evaluation of denoising pipelines aimed at reducing noise-related functional connectivity in a clinical population known to be highly susceptible to in-scanner motion and significant anatomical abnormalities. If resting-state functional magnetic resonance is to be a successful clinical technique, it is crucial that procedures mitigating the effect of noise be systematically evaluated in the most challenging populations, such as traumatic brain injury datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-speed, multi-Z confocal microscopy for voltage imaging in densely labeled neuronal populations</a></h4>

              
                Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) hold great promise for monitoring neuronal population activity, but GEVI imaging in dense neuronal populations remains difficult due to a lack of contrast and/or speed. To address this challenge, we developed a novel confocal microscope that allows simultaneous multiplane imaging with high-contrast at near-kHz rates. This approach enables high signal-to-noise ratio voltage imaging in densely labeled populations and minimizes optical crosstalk during concurrent optogenetic photostimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting proprioceptive cortical anatomy and neural coding with topographic autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                Proprioception is one of the least understood senses yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a variational autoencoder with topographic lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Topo-VAE provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with application the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Test-retest reproducibility of in vivo magnetization transfer ratio and saturation index in mice at 9.4 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat) imaging was developed to reduce T1 dependence and improve specificity to myelin compared to the widely used MT ratio (MTR), while maintaining a feasible scan time. Knowledge of MTsat reproducibility is necessary to apply MTsat in preclinical neuroimaging. Purpose: To assess the test-retest reproducibility of MTR and MTsat in the mouse brain at 9.4 T and calculate sample sizes required to detect various effect sizes. Study Type: Prospective. Animal Model: C57Bl/6 Mouse Model (6 females and 6 males, aged 12 to 14 weeks). Field Strength/Sequence: Magnetization Transfer Imaging at 9.4 T. Assessment: All mice were scanned at two timepoints (5 days apart). MTR and MTsat maps were analyzed using mean region of interest (ROI), and whole brain voxel-wise analysis. Statistical Tests: Bland Altman plots assessed biases between test and retest measurements. Test retest reproducibility was evaluated via between and within-subject coefficients of variation (CV). Sample sizes required were calculated (at a 95 % significance level and power of 80 %), given various minimum detectable effect sizes, using both between and within-subject approaches. Results: Bland Altman plots showed negligible biases between test and retest sessions. ROI based and voxel-wise CVs revealed high reproducibility for both MTR (ROI: CVs < 8 %) and MTsat (ROI: CVs < 10 %). With a sample size of 6, changes on the order of 15% can be detected in MTR and MTsat, both between and within subjects, while smaller changes (6 to 8 %) require sample sizes of 10 to 15 for MTR, and 15 to 20 for MTsat. Data Conclusion: MTsat exhibits comparable reproducibility to MTR, while providing sensitivity to myelin with less T1 dependence than MTR. Our findings suggest both MTR and MTsat can detect moderate changes, common in pathologies, with feasible preclinical sample sizes. Keywords: magnetization transfer ratio, magnetization transfer saturation, reproducibility, preclinical rodent imaging

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability of transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials to detect the effects of theta-burst stimulation of the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) is a novel method for assessing cortical properties outside the motor region. Theta burst stimulation (TBS), a form of repetitive TMS, can non-invasively modulate cortical excitability and has been increasingly used to treat psychiatric disorders by targetting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) analysis has been used to evaluate cortical excitability changes after TBS. However, it remains unclear whether TEPs can detect the neuromodulatory effects of TBS. Objectives: To confirm the reliability of TEP components within and between sessions and to measure changes in neural excitability induced by intermittent (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) applied to the left DLPFC. Methods: Test-retest reliability of TEPs and TBS-induced changes in cortical excitability were assessed in twenty-four healthy participants by stimulating the DLPFC in five separate sessions, once with sham and twice with iTBS and cTBS. EEG responses were recorded of 100 single TMS pulses before and after TBS, and the reproducibility measures were quantified with the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Results: The N100 and P200 components presented substantial reliability within the baseline block (CCCs>0.8) and moderate concordance between sessions (CCCmax{approx}0.7). Both N40 and P60 TEP amplitudes showed little concordance between sessions. Changes in TEP amplitudes after iTBS were marginally reliable for N100 (CCCmax=0.52), P200 (CCCmax=0.47) and P60 (CCCmax=0.40), presenting only fair levels of concordance at specific time points. Conclusions: The present findings show that only the N100 and P200 components had good concordance between sessions. The reliability of earlier components may have been affected by TMS-evoked artefacts. The poor reliability to detect changes in neural excitability induced by TBS indicates that TEPs do not provide a precise estimate of the changes in excitability in the DLPFC or, alternatively, that TBS did not induce consistent changes in neural excitability.

	<p>This review evaluated if the hypothesis of a causal link between the left lateralization of language and other brain asymmetries could be supported by a careful review of data gathered in patients with unilateral brain lesions. In a short introduction a distinction was made between brain activities that could: (a) benefit from the shaping influences of language (such as the capacity to solve non-verbal cognitive tasks and the increased levels of consciousness and of intentionality); (b) be incompatible with the properties and the shaping activities of language (e.g., the relations between language and the automatic orienting of visual-spatial attention or between cognition and emotion) and (c) be more represented on the right hemisphere due to competition for cortical space. The correspondence between predictions based on the theoretical impact of language on other brain functions and data obtained in patients with lesions of the right and left hemisphere was then assessed. The reviewed data suggest that different kinds of hemispheric asymmetries observed in patients with unilateral brain lesions could be subsumed by common mechanisms, more or less directly linked to the left lateralization of language.</p>

	<p>Microglia are major players in scar formation after an injury to the spinal cord. Microglia proliferation, differentiation, and survival are regulated by the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Complete microglia elimination using CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors worsens motor function recovery after spinal injury (SCI). Conversely, a 1-week oral treatment with GW2580, a CSF1R inhibitor that only inhibits microglia proliferation, promotes motor recovery. Here, we investigate whether prolonged GW2580 treatment further increases beneficial effects on locomotion after SCI. We thus assessed the effect of a 6-week GW2580 oral treatment after lateral hemisection of the spinal cord on functional recovery and its outcome on tissue and cellular responses in adult mice. Long-term depletion of microglia proliferation after SCI failed to improve motor recovery and had no effect on tissue reorganization, as revealed by ex vivo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Six weeks after SCI, GW2580 treatment decreased microglial reactivity and increased astrocytic reactivity. We thus demonstrate that increasing the duration of GW2580 treatment is not beneficial for motor recovery after SCI.</p>

	<p>Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is among the most common stroke sequelae and affects rehabilitation, resulting in poor recovery. A main influencing factor may be depression, which has been investigated with fatigue in several clinical trials. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of fatigue in post-stroke patients without depression through a retrospective chart review. The medical records of stroke patients hospitalized in the Stroke and Brain Disease Center, Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital were reviewed. Stroke patients without depression were divided into a PSF group and control group (without fatigue). The demographic characteristics, type of stroke, medical history, laboratory examinations, clinical features, and pattern identification of each patient were recorded and compared between the study groups. The medical records of 216 patients were reviewed; 85 and 131 patients were assigned to the PSF and control group, respectively. Apolipoprotein A1 levels were significantly lower in the PSF than in the control group (105.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.5 vs. 116.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 21.8). We found a significantly higher occurrence of reversal cold of the extremities and a lower probability of fire-heat pattern in the PSF group than in the control group. This study suggests that apolipoprotein A1 levels are lower and cold manifestations are more common in PSF patients without depression than in those without fatigue.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by arterial and/or venous thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity and raised titers of antiphospholipid antibodies. Cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) is a rare form of cerebrovascular accident and an uncommon APS manifestation; the information in the literature about this feature consists of case reports and small case series. Our purpose is to describe the particular characteristics of CVT when occurs as part of the APS and compare our series with the patients published in the literature. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study collecting data from medical records in three referral centers for APS and CVT, and a systematic review of the literature for CVT cases in APS patients. (3) Results: Twenty-seven APS patients with CVT were identified in our medical records, the majority of them diagnosed as primary APS and with the CVT being the first manifestation of the disease; additional risk factors for thrombosis were identified. The review of the literature yielded 86 cases, with similar characteristics as those of our retrospective series. (4) Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study is the largest CVT series in APS patients published to date, providing a unique point of view in this rare thrombotic manifestation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">IGF1 Receptor Regulates Upward Firing Rate Homeostasis via the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of firing rate homeostasis constitutes a fundamental property of central neural circuits. While intracellular Ca2+ has long been hypothesized to be a feedback control signal, the molecular machinery enabling network-wide homeostatic response remains largely unknown. Here we show that deletion of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), a well-known regulator of neurodevelopment and ageing, limits firing rate homeostasis in response to inactivity, without altering the baseline firing rate distribution. Disruption of both synaptic and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity contributed to deficient firing rate homeostatic response. At the cellular level, a fraction of IGF1Rs was localized in mitochondria with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUc). IGF1R deletion suppressed mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) evoked by spike bursts by weakening mitochondria-to-cytosol Ca2+ coupling. This coupling was homeostatically maintained following inactivity in control, but upregulated in IGF1R-deficient neurons. MCUc overexpression in IGF1R-deficient neurons rescued the deficits in spike-to-mitoCa2+ coupling and firing rate homeostasis. Our findings highlight IGF1R as a key regulator of the integrated homeostatic response by tuning mitochondrial temporal filtering. Decline in mitochondrial reliability for burst transfer may drive dysregulation of firing rate homeostasis in brain disorders associated with abnormal IGF1R / MCUc signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The human thalamus orchestrates neocortical oscillations during NREM sleep.</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the coordinated interplay of slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. Traditionally, a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop is suggested to coordinate these rhythms: neocortically-generated SOs trigger spindles in the thalamus that are projected back to neocortex. Here, we used direct intrathalamic recordings from human epilepsy patients to test this canonical interplay. We show that SOs in the anterior thalamus precede neocortical SOs, whereas concurrently-recorded SOs in the mediodorsal thalamus are led by neocortical SOs. Furthermore, sleep spindles, detected in both thalamic nuclei, preceded their neocortical counterparts and were initiated during early phases of thalamic SOs. Our findings indicate an active role of the anterior thalamus in organizing the cardinal sleep rhythms in the neocortex and highlight the functional diversity of specific thalamic nuclei in humans. The concurrent coordination of sleep oscillations by the thalamus could have broad implications for the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption in structural-functional network repertoire and time resolved subcortical-frontoparietal connectivity in disorders of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Understanding recovery of consciousness and elucidating its underlying mechanism is believed to be crucial in the field of basic neuroscience and medicine. Ideas such as the global neuronal workspace and the mesocircuit theory hypothesize that failure of recovery in conscious states coincide with loss of connectivity between subcortical and frontoparietal areas, a loss of the repertoire of functional networks states and metastable brain activation. We adopted a time-resolved functional connectivity framework to explore these ideas and assessed the repertoire of functional network states as a potential marker of consciousness and its potential ability to tell apart patients in the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). In addition, prediction of these functional network states by underlying hidden spatial patterns in the anatomical network, i.e. so-called eigenmodes, were supplemented as potential markers. By analysing time-resolved functional connectivity from fMRI data, we demonstrated a reduction of metastability and functional network repertoire in UWS compared to MCS patients. This was expressed in terms of diminished dwell times and loss of nonstationarity in the default mode network and fronto-parietal subcortical network in UWS compared to MCS patients. We further demonstrated that these findings co-occurred with a loss of dynamic interplay between structural eigenmodes and emerging time-resolved functional connectivity in UWS. These results are, amongst others, in support of the global neuronal workspace theory and the mesocircuit hypothesis, underpinning the role of time-resolved thalamo-cortical connections and metastability in the recovery of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ion channel distributions in cortical neurons are optimized for energy-efficient active dendritic computations</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain uses more than 20% of the energy consumed by the entire body. This enormous demand for energy is thought to impose strong selective pressure by which neurons evolve in ways that ensure robust function at minimal energy cost. Here we demonstrate that the ion channel expression patterns by which pyramidal tract neurons - the major output cell type of the cerebral cortex - could implement their complex intrinsic physiology is extremely widespread. Surprisingly, this wide spectrum does not reflect morphological variability, but the energy costs for generating dendritic calcium action potentials. We found that energy-efficient calcium action potentials require a low expression of slow inactivating potassium channels in the distal dendrites, an empirical observation whose significance remained unclear for more than a decade. Thus, cortical neurons do not utilize all theoretically possible ways to implement their functions, but instead appear to select those optimized for energy-efficient active dendritic computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal cortex directs learning-related changes in CA1 representations</a></h4>

              
                Learning-related changes in brain activity are thought to underlie adaptive behaviors. For instance, the learning of a reward site by rodents requires the development of an over-representation of that location in the hippocampus. However, how this learning-related change occurs remains unknown. Here we recorded hippocampal CA1 population activity as mice learned a reward location on a linear treadmill. Physiological and pharmacological evidence suggests that the adaptive over-representation required behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). BTSP is known to be driven by dendritic voltage signals that we hypothesized were initiated by input from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3). Accordingly, the CA1 over-representation was largely removed by optogenetic inhibition of EC3 activity. Recordings from EC3 neurons revealed an activity pattern that could provide an instructive signal directing BTSP to generate the over-representation. Consistent with this function, exposure to a second environment possessing a prominent reward-predictive cue resulted in both EC3 activity and CA1 place field density that were more elevated at the cue than the reward. These data indicate that learning-related changes in the hippocampus are produced by synaptic plasticity directed by an instructive signal from the EC3 that appears to be specifically adapted to the behaviorally relevant features of the environment.

	<p>Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) developed to induce neuroplasticity. TBS usually consists of 50 Hz bursts at 5 Hz intervals. It can facilitate motor evoked potentials (MEPs) when applied intermittently, although this effect can vary between individuals. Here, we sought to determine whether a modified version of intermittent TBS (iTBS) consisting of 30 Hz bursts repeated at 6 Hz intervals would lead to lasting MEP facilitation. We also investigated whether recruitment of early and late indirect waves (I-waves) would predict individual responses to 30 Hz iTBS. Participants (n = 19) underwent single-pulse TMS to assess MEP amplitude at baseline and variations in MEP latency in response to anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior, and latero-medial stimulation. Then, 30 Hz iTBS was administered, and MEP amplitude was reassessed at 5-, 20- and 45-min. Post iTBS, most participants (13/19) exhibited MEP facilitation, with significant effects detected at 20- and 45-min. Contrary to previous evidence, recruitment of early I-waves predicted facilitation to 30 Hz iTBS. These observations suggest that 30 Hz/6 Hz iTBS is effective in inducing lasting facilitation in corticospinal excitability and may offer an alternative to the standard 50 Hz/5 Hz protocol.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With the advent of real-time MRI, the motion and passage of cerebrospinal fluid can be visualized without gating and exclusion of low-frequency waves. This imaging modality gives insights into low-volume, rapidly oscillating cardiac-driven movement as well as sustained, high-volume, slowly oscillating inspiration-driven movement. Inspiration means a spontaneous or artificial increase in the intrathoracic dimensions independent of body position. Alterations in thoracic diameter enable the thoracic and spinal epidural venous compartments to be emptied and filled, producing an upward surge of cerebrospinal fluid inside the spine during inspiration; this surge counterbalances the downward pooling of venous blood toward the heart. Real-time MRI, as a macroscale in vivo observation method, could expand our knowledge of neurofluid dynamics, including how astrocytic fluid preloading is adjusted and how brain buoyancy and turgor are maintained in different postures and zero gravity. Along with these macroscale findings, new microscale insights into aquaporin-mediated fluid transfer, its sensing by cilia, and its tuning by nitric oxide will be reviewed. By incorporating clinical knowledge spanning several disciplines, certain disorders—congenital hydrocephalus with Chiari malformation, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and adult idiopathic hydrocephalus—are interpreted and reviewed according to current concepts, from the basics of the interrelated systems to their pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Is cyclooxygenase‐1 involved in neuroinflammation?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Purpose:</i> Reactive microglia are an important hallmark of neuroinflammation. Reactive microglia release various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins, which are produced by enzymes like cyclooxygenases (COX). The inducible COX-2 subtype has been associated with inflammation, whereas the constitutively expressed COX-1 subtype is generally considered as a housekeeping enzyme. However, recent evidence suggests that COX-1 can also be upregulated and may play a prominent role in the brain during neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports this involvement of COX-1. <i>Methods</i>: Five databases were used to retrieve relevant studies that addressed COX-1 in the context of neuroinflammation. The search resulted in 32 articles, describing <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, post mortem, and <i>in vivo</i> imaging studies that specifically investigated the COX-1 isoform under such conditions. <i>Results</i>: Reviewed literature generally indicated that the overexpression of COX-1 was induced by an inflammatory stimulus, which resulted in an increased production of prostaglandin E2. The pharmacological inhibition of COX-1 was shown to suppress the induction of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin E2. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in animal models confirmed the overexpression of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The same imaging method, however, could not detect any upregulation of COX-1 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. <i>Conclusion</i>: Taken together, studies in cultured cells and living rodents suggest that COX-1 is involved in neuroinflammation. Most postmortem studies on human brains indicate that the concentration of COX-1-expressing microglial cells is increased near sites of inflammation. However, evidence for the involvement of COX-1 in neuroinflammation in the living human brain is still largely lacking.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is driven by a vicious cycle of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, breaking this vicious cycle by suppressing neuronal hyperactivity may represent a logical approach to stopping AD progression. In support of this, we have recently shown that genetically and pharmacologically limiting ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) open time prevented neuronal hyperactivity, memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in a rapid, early onset AD mouse model (5xFAD). Here, we assessed the impact of limiting RyR2 open time on AD-related deficits in a relatively late occurring, slow developing AD mouse model (3xTG-AD) that bears more resemblance (compared to 5xFAD) to that of human AD. Using behavioral tests, long-term potentiation recordings, and Golgi and Nissl staining, we found that the RyR2-E4872Q mutation, which markedly shortens the open duration of the RyR2 channel, prevented learning and memory impairment, defective long-term potentiation, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mice. Furthermore, pharmacologically shortening the RyR2 open time with R-carvedilol rescued these AD-related deficits in 3xTG mice. Therefore, limiting RyR2 open time may offer a promising, neuronal hyperactivity-targeted anti-AD strategy.</p>

<p>LDT–VTA inputs optogenetic manipulation changes motivational drive and modifies preference.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brainstem nucleus classically involved in REM sleep and attention, and that has recently been associated with reward-related behaviors, as it controls the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, modulating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. To further understand the role of LDT–VTA inputs in reinforcement, we optogenetically manipulated these inputs during different behavioral paradigms in male rats. We found that in a two-choice instrumental task, optical activation of LDT–VTA projections shifts and amplifies preference to the laser-paired reward in comparison to an otherwise equal reward; the opposite was observed with inhibition experiments. In a progressive ratio task, LDT–VTA activation boosts motivation, that is, enhances the willingness to work to get the reward associated with LDT–VTA stimulation; and the reverse occurs when inhibiting these inputs. Animals abolished preference if the reward was omitted, suggesting that LDT–VTA stimulation adds/decreases value to the stimulation-paired reward. In addition, we show that LDT–VTA optical activation induces robust preference in the conditioned and real-time place preference tests, while optical inhibition induces aversion. The behavioral findings are supported by electrophysiological recordings and c-fos immunofluorescence correlates in downstream target regions. In LDT–VTA ChR2 animals, we observed an increase in the recruitment of lateral VTA dopamine neurons and D1 neurons from nucleus accumbens core and shell; whereas in LDT–VTA NpHR animals, D2 neurons appear to be preferentially recruited. Collectively, these data show that the LDT–VTA inputs encode positive reinforcement signals and are important for different dimensions of reward-related behaviors.</p>

<p>This study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in incarcerated violent offenders with psychopathic traits as compared to controls. Findings reveal no abnormal early responses in offenders but suggest specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antisocial and psychopathic individuals are characterized by a reduced responsivity to affective information. Yet, the role of attentional processes as possible modulator of these deficits is poorly understood. The current study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in a sample of incarcerated offenders while manipulating the attentional focus. Twenty-seven male violent offenders with psychopathic traits and 27 healthy controls completed two experimental tasks while electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected. Task 1 assessed indirect processing of emotional or neutral distractors during a perceptual judgment task, while Task 2 measured direct processing of the emotional or neutral stimuli and required participants to rate the stimuli regarding valence and arousal. EEG data indicated no differences in early stage processing (early posterior negativity) between the experimental groups. However, we found significant group differences with regard to the late processing stage (late positive potential, LPP). Controls showed increased LPP amplitudes in Task 2 as compared to Task 1, indicating that task demands (i.e., attentional focus) had an effect on the processing of the emotional stimuli. In contrast, LPP amplitudes in the violent offender group were largely unaffected by task demands, suggesting specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli. In sum, this study provides new evidence for a modulatory impact of attention on affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits.</p>

     alt="Neuronal deficiency of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α increases hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal mice"/>
<p>Using CaMKIIαCre and floxed-HIF-2α mice, we generated mice with specific deletion of HIF-2α gene in the forebrain neurons. We showed that neuronal deficiency of HIF-2α increased cell death and brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia suggesting its involvement in neuroprotection.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cellular responses to hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are governed largely by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors. Our previous studies show that HIF-1α induction is an important factor that mediates protective effects in the brain after neonatal HI. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of another closely related HIF α isoform, HIF-2α, specifically the neuronal HIF-2α, to brain HI injury. Homozygous transgenic mice with a floxed exon 2 of HIF-2α were bred with CaMKIIα-Cre mice to generate a mouse line with selective deletion of HIF-2α in forebrain neurons. These mice, along with their wildtype littermates, were subjected to HI at postnatal day 9. Brain injury at different ages was evaluated by the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and spectrin breakdown products at 24 hr; and histologically at 6 days or 3 months after HI. Multiple behavioral tests were performed at 3 months, prior to sacrifice. Loss of neuronal HIF-2α exacerbated brain injury during the acute (24 hr) and subacute phases (6 days), with a trend toward more severe volume loss in the adult brain. The long-term brain function for coordinated movement and recognition memory, however, were not impacted in the neuronal HIF-2α deficient mice. Our data suggest that, similar to HIF-1α, neuronal HIF-2α promotes cell survival in the immature mouse brain. The two HIF alpha isoforms may act through partially overlapping or distinct transcriptional targets to mediate their intrinsic protective responses against neonatal HI brain injury.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endocannabinoid system has been extensively studied in recent decades, particularly the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, due to their important role in neuroinflammation. Among these, CB2 has gained prominence due to its selective overexpression in glial cells during neuroinflammation. In contrast to CB1 agonists, CB2 agonists have no side effects such as ataxia, hypothermia, euphoria, psychological, or addiction liabilities. CB2 and its selective agonists' above-mentioned unique properties have become a research focus in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The review discusses the neuroprotective role of CB receptors, particularly CB2, in AD, as well as the significance and limitations of this research.</p>

     alt="Isoxazole-9 reduces enhanced fear responses and retrieval in ethanol-dependent male rats"/>
<p>This study used an established animal model of ethanol dependence and found that abstinence from ethanol experience alters fear memory consolidation and plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with small molecule isoxazole-9 prevented the altered fear responses during abstinence and normalized cellular and plasticity changes in the ventral dentate gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) is strongly influenced by ethanol, and ethanol experience alters long-term memory consolidation dependent on the DG. However, it is unclear if DG plasticity plays a role in dysregulation of long-term memory consolidation during abstinence from chronic ethanol experience. Outbred male Wistar rats experienced 7 weeks of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE). Seventy-two hours after CIE cessation, CIE and age-matched ethanol-naïve Air controls experienced auditory trace fear conditioning (TFC). Rats were tested for cue-mediated retrieval in the fear context either twenty-four hours (24 hr), ten days (10 days), or twenty-one days (21 days) later. CIE rats showed enhanced freezing behavior during TFC acquisition compared to Air rats. Air rats showed significant fear retrieval, and this behavior did not differ at the three time points. In CIE rats, fear retrieval increased over time during abstinence, indicating an incubation in fear responses. Enhanced retrieval at 21 days was associated with reduced structural and functional plasticity of ventral granule cell neurons (GCNs) and reduced expression of synaptic proteins important for neuronal plasticity. Systemic treatment with the drug Isoxazole-9 (Isx-9; small molecule that stimulates DG plasticity) during the last week and a half of CIE blocked altered acquisition and retrieval of fear memories in CIE rats during abstinence. Concurrently, Isx-9 modulated the structural and functional plasticity of ventral GCNs and the expression of synaptic proteins in the ventral DG. These findings identify that abstinence-induced disruption of fear memory consolidation occurs via altered plasticity within the ventral DG, and that Isx-9 prevented these effects.</p>

<p>MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to model schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotypes. Here we compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish behavioral assays. We found that MK-801 disrupted social interaction and altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. Exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain. This corroborates previous studies and reinforces the use of zebrafish to study schizophrenia-related endophenotypes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia pathophysiology has been associated with dopaminergic hyperactivity, NMDA receptor hypofunction, and redox dysregulation. Most behavioral assays and animal models to study this condition were developed in rodents, leaving room for species-specific biases that could be avoided by cross-species approaches. As MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to mimic schizophrenia features, this study aimed to compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) behavioral assays. Male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to MK-801 (1, 5, and 10 μM) or amphetamine (0.625, 2.5, and 10 mg/L) and observed in paradigms of locomotor activity and social behavior. Oxidative parameters were quantified in brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that MK-801 disrupted social interaction, an effect that resembles the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It also altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. On the other hand, exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain. Key outcomes induced by MK-801 in rodents, such as social interaction deficit and locomotor alterations, were replicated in zebrafish, corroborating previous studies and reinforcing the use of zebrafish to study schizophrenia-related endophenotypes. More studies are necessary to assess the predictive validity of preclinical paradigms with this species and ultimately optimize the screening of potential novel treatments.</p>

     alt="Characterizing the hyper- and hypometabolism in temporal lobe epilepsy using multivariate machine learning"/>
<p>We applied multivariate linear support vector classification on voxel-wise glucose uptake measured through PET imaging, and effectively classified mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients from healthy controls (cross-validated accuracy &gt;95%). Both ipsilateral hypometabolism and contralateral hypermetabolism significantly contributed to the model, confirming the added values of metabolic abnormalities in assisting MTLE diagnosis through quantitative approaches.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy, presenting both structural and metabolic abnormalities in the ipsilateral mesial temporal lobe. While it has been demonstrated that the metabolic abnormalities in MTLE actually extend beyond the epileptogenic zone, how such multidimensional information is associated with the diagnosis of MTLE remains to be tested. Here, we explore the whole-brain metabolic patterns in 23 patients with MTLE and 24 healthy controls using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. Based on a multivariate machine learning approach, we demonstrate that the brain metabolic patterns can discriminate patients with MTLE from controls with a superior accuracy (&gt;95%). Importantly, voxels showing the most extreme contributing weights to the classification (i.e., the most important regional predictors) distribute across both hemispheres, involving both ipsilateral negative weights over the anterior part of lateral and medial temporal lobe, posterior insula, and lateral orbital frontal gyrus, and contralateral positive weights over the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and lingual gyrus. Through region-of-interest analyses, we verify that in patients with MTLE, the negatively weighted regions are hypometabolic, and the positively weighted regions are hypermetabolic, compared to controls. Interestingly, despite that both hypo- and hypermetabolism have mutually contributed to our model, they may reflect different pathological and/or compensative responses. For instance, patients with earlier age at epilepsy onset present greater hypometabolism in the ipsilateral inferior temporal gyrus, while we find no evidence of such association with hypermetabolism. In summary, quantitative models utilizing multidimensional brain metabolic information may provide additional assistance to presurgical workups in TLE.</p>

     alt="Comparing axon regeneration in male and female mice after peripheral nerve injury"/>
<p>In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, axon regeneration occurs spontaneously after injury. This study examined if axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury was sex dependent and found that the extent of axon regeneration was indistinguishable in male and female mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes associated with neurite outgrowth were commonly induced in the two sexes, despite that a majority of genes were sex-dependently induced by injury. Therefore, although male and female mice exhibit similar axon regeneration, the mechanisms involved might not be identical.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate after injury. By contrast, spontaneous axon regeneration occurs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) due to a supportive PNS environment and an increase in the intrinsic growth potential induced by injury via cooperative activation of multifaceted biological pathways. This study compared axon regeneration and injury responses in C57BL/6 male and female mice after sciatic nerve crush (SNC) injury. The extent of axon regeneration <i>in vivo</i> was indistinguishable in male and female mice when observed at 3 days after SNC injury, and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from injured, male and female mice extended axons to a similar length. Moreover, the induction of selected regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), such as <i>Atf3</i>, <i>Sprr1a</i>, <i>Gap43</i>, <i>Sox11</i>, <i>Jun</i>, <i>Gadd45a</i>, and <i>Smad1</i> were comparable in male and female DRGs when assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis of male and female DRGs revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SNC groups compared to sham-operated groups included many common genes associated with neurite outgrowth. However, we also found that a large number of genes in the DEGs were sex dependent, implicating the involvement of distinct gene regulatory network in the two sexes following peripheral nerve injury. In conclusion, we found that male and female mice mounted a comparable axon regeneration response and many RAGs were commonly induced in response to SNC. However, given that many DEGs were sex-dependently expressed, future studies are needed to investigate whether they contribute to peripheral axon regeneration, and if so, to what extent.</p>

<p>Mice were subjected to the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, and fecal samples were collected at each phase. The V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were detected, and the composition, network structures, and gene functions of the gut microbiota were compared between groups or phases.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The gut–brain axis provides a pathway for the interaction between gut microbiota and methamphetamine (METH) addiction. However, the gut microbial signatures during different phases of METH use remain unclear. In the present study, we established models of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice and detected the gut microbiome profiles of the fecal samples at the three phases by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that the richness of the gut microbiome increased following repeated METH administration, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The microbial richness remained at a low level after one METH challenge at the reinstatement phase. The abundance of several genera including <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> differentially altered among phases of METH-induced CPP. The co-occurrence networks of the gut microbiome became weaker and more unstable during the development of METH-induced CPP at the extinction and reinstatement phases.

<p>The differential effects of osteopontin on major functions of primary resting and activated astrocytes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glycoprotein osteopontin is highly upregulated in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as ischemic stroke. Osteopontin regulates cell growth, cell adhesion, homeostasis, migration, and survival of various cell types. Accordingly, osteopontin is considered an essential regulator of regeneration and repair in the ischemic milieu. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and play significant roles in health and disease. Astrocytes are involved in homeostasis, promote neuroprotection, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Upon activation, astrocytes may adopt different phenotypes, termed A1 and A2. The direct effects of osteopontin on astrocytes, especially in distinct activation states, are yet unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate the impact of osteopontin on resting and active astrocytes. We established an inflammatory <i>in vitro</i> model of activated (A1) primary astrocytes derived from neonatal wistar rats by exposure to a distinct combination of proinflammatory cytokines. To model ischemic stroke <i>in vitro</i>, astrocytes were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence or absence of osteopontin. Osteopontin modulated the activation phenotype by attenuating A1- and restoring A2-marker expression without compromising the active astrocytes’ immunocompetence. Osteopontin promoted the proliferation of active and the migration of resting astrocytes. Following transient OGD, osteopontin mitigated the delayed ongoing death of primary astrocytes, promoting their survival. Data suggest that osteopontin differentially regulates essential functions of resting and active astrocytes and confirm a significant regulatory role of osteopontin in an <i>in vitro</i> ischemia model. Furthermore, the data suggest that osteopontin constitutes a promising target for experimental therapies modulating neuroregeneration and repair.</p>

<p>Stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli shown to increase neuronal discharge irregularity and gain in Type A and B medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons. Potentially via antagonism of voltage-sensitive channels expressed on MVN neuronal membranes such as the large conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels (<i>black</i>) and associated N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels associated with slow conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels (<i>gray</i>).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) has been shown to improve vestibular function potentially via stochastic resonance, however, it remains unknown how central vestibular nuclei process these signals. <i>In vivo</i> work applying electrical stimuli to the vestibular apparatus of animals has shown changes in neuronal discharge at the level of the primary vestibular afferents and hair cells. This study aimed to determine the cellular impacts of stochastic, sinusoidal, and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli on individual medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons of male and female C57BL/6 mice. All stimuli increased the irregularity of MVN neuronal discharge, while differentially affecting neuronal gain. This suggests that the heterogeneous MVN neuronal population (marked by differential expression of ion channels), may influence the impact of electrical stimuli on neuronal discharge. Neuronal subtypes showed increased variability of neuronal firing, where Type A and B neurons experienced the largest gain changes in response to stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli. Type C neurons were the least affected regarding neuronal firing variability and gain changes. The membrane potential (MP) of neurons was altered by sinusoidal and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli, with Type B and C neuronal MP significantly affected. These results indicate that GVS-like electrical stimuli impact MVN neuronal discharge differentially, likely as a result of heterogeneous ion channel expression.</p>

<p>Overexpression of WT α-syn and the mutant α-syn A30P promotes the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in mitochondria and the reduction in contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, disrupting the IP3R-GRP75 interaction. Disruption of mitochondria-associated ER membranes causes a reduction in calcium transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are formed by close and specific components in the contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which participate in several cell functions, including lipid metabolism, autophagy, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Particularly, the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn) in MAMs was previously demonstrated, indicating a physical interaction among some proteins in this region and a potential involvement in cell dysfunctions. MAMs alterations are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to the pathogenesis features. Here, we investigated the effects of α-syn on MAMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to mitochondria in WT- and A30P α-syn-overexpressing SH-SY5Y or HEK293 cells. We observed that α-syn potentiates the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) loss induced by rotenone, increases mitophagy and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. Additionally, in α-syn-overexpressing cells, we found a reduction in ER–mitochondria contact sites through the impairment of the GRP75–IP3R interaction, however, with no alteration in VDAC1–GRP75 interaction. Consequently, after Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, α-syn-overexpressing cells demonstrated a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering by mitochondria, suggesting a deregulation in MAM activity. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of the α-syn/MAMs/Ca<sup>2+</sup> axis that potentially affects cell functions in PD.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairments are characteristics of patients with white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and hypoperfusion is currently a relatively recognized mechanism of WMHs. Brain activity is closely coupled to the regulation of local blood flow. This study aimed to investigate the abnormal local brain activity of patients with WMHs from the viewpoint of the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (sALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF). Seventy-four patients with WMHs and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Based on the Fazekas scale, patients with WMHs were further divided into a mild WMH group (<i>n</i> = 33, Fazekas score 1–2) and moderate-severe WMH group (<i>n</i> = 41, Fazekas score 3–6). The sALFF and dALFF values were calculated separately and neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Boston Naming Test (BNT) were completed by all participants. Patients with WMHs showed increased sALFF and dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus and decreased performance in the MoCA test, AVLT-immediate, AVLT-delay, AVLT-recognition, TMT-A, and BNT. The dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus was correlated with the MoCA in HCs. The sALFF values in the bilateral thalamus correlated with TMT-B in patients with WMHs. Patients with WMHs showed abnormal brain activity and decreased functional stability of the bilateral thalamus, which may be a potential mechanism of decreased executive function.</p>

<p>Spatial memory impairments in people with Huntington's disease (HD) were related to volumes of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampus. We suggest that spatial memory impairments should be included in the cognitive phenotype of HD.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial memory impairments are observed in people with Huntington's disease (HD), however, the domain of spatial memory has received little focus when characterizing the cognitive phenotype of HD. Spatial memory is traditionally thought to be a hippocampal-dependent function, while the neuropathology of HD centers on the striatum. Alongside spatial memory deficits in HD, recent neurocognitive theories suggest that a larger brain network is involved, including the striatum. We examined the relationship between hippocampal and striatal volumes and spatial memory in 36 HD gene expansion carriers, including premanifest (<i>n</i> = 24) and early manifest HD (<i>n</i> = 12), and 32 matched healthy controls. We assessed spatial memory with Paired Associates Learning, Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Virtual House task, which assesses three components of spatial memory: navigation, object location, and plan drawing. Caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampal volumes were manually segmented on T1-weighted MR images. As expected, caudate nucleus and putamen volumes were significantly smaller in the HD group compared to controls, with manifest HD having more severe atrophy than the premanifest HD group. Hippocampal volumes did not differ significantly between HD and control groups. Nonetheless, on average, the HD group performed significantly worse than controls across all spatial memory tasks. The spatial memory components of object location and recall of figural and topographical drawings were associated with striatal and hippocampal volumes in the HD cohort. We provide a case to include spatial memory impairments in the cognitive phenotype of HD, and extend the neurocognitive picture of HD beyond its primary pathology within the striatum.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination is crucial for the development and maintenance of axonal integrity, especially fast axonal action potential conduction. There is increasing evidence that glutamate signaling and release through neuronal activity modulates the myelination process. In this study, we examine the effect of manipulating glutamate signaling on myelination of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells and their development in zebrafish (zf). We use the “intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter” (iGluSnFR) in the zf model (both sexes) to address the hypothesis that glutamate is implicated in regulation of myelinating OLs. Our results show that glial iGluSnFR expression significantly reduces OL lineage cell number and the expression of myelin markers in larvae (zfl) and adult brains. The specific glutamate receptor agonist, L-AP4, rescues this iGluSnFR effect by significantly increasing the expression of the myelin-related genes, <i>plp1b</i> and <i>mbpa</i>, and enhances myelination in L-AP4-injected zfl compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that degrading glutamate using Glutamat-Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) or the blockade of glutamate reuptake by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) significantly decreases myelin-related genes and drastically declines myelination in brain ventricle-injected zfl. Moreover, we found that myelin-specific ClaudinK (CldnK) and 36K protein expression is significantly decreased in iGluSnFR-expressing zfl and adult brains compared to controls. Taken together, this study confirms that glutamate signaling is directly required for the preservation of myelinating OLs and for the myelination process itself. These findings further suggest that glutamate signaling may provide novel targets to therapeutically boost remyelination in several demyelinating diseases of the CNS.</p>

<p>Brain stem is one of the earliest affected regions in synucleinopathies. The present study demonstrated that pontine mean diffusivity values would be a useful neurodegeneration marker in synucleinopathies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pons is one of the earliest affected regions in patients with synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of measuring pontine damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in these patients. We enrolled 49 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 16 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 23 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 39 healthy controls in this study. All the participants underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fraction anisotropy (FA) values in the pons were calculated to characterize structural damage. The discriminatory power of pontine MD and FA values to differentiate patients with synucleinopathies from healthy controls was examined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses. Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD, iRBD, and MSA had increased MD values and decreased FA values in the pons, although no correlation was observed between these DTI measures and disease severity. The ROC analyses showed that MD values in the pons had a fair discriminatory power to differentiate healthy controls from patients with PD (area under the curve [AUC], 0.813), iRBD (AUC, 0.779), and MSA (AUC, 0.951). The AUC for pontine FA values was smaller than that for pontine MD values when differentiating healthy controls from patients with PD (AUC, 0.713; <i>p</i> = 0.054) and iRBD (AUC, 0.686; <i>p</i> = 0.045). Our results suggest that MD values in the pons may be a useful marker of brain stem neurodegeneration in patients with synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Loss of <i>Cx3cr1</i> function compromises cochlear defense mechanisms against noise-induced neutrophil infiltration and potentiates functional loss of the cochlea. This study provides new insights into the molecular control of cochlear neutrophil activities after noise damage.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cochlea, the sensory organ for hearing, has a protected immune environment, segregated from the systemic immune system by the blood-labyrinth barrier. Previous studies have revealed that acute acoustic injury causes the infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the cochlea. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling immune cell trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we report the role of CX3CR1 in regulating the entry of neutrophils into the cochlea after acoustic trauma. We employed B6.129P-<i>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup>
</i>/J mice, a transgenic strain that lacks the gene, <i>Cx3cr1</i>, for coding the fractalkine receptor. Our results demonstrate that lack of <i>Cx3cr1</i> results in the augmentation of neutrophil infiltration into cochlear tissues after exposure to an intense noise of 120 dB SPL for 1 hr. Neutrophil distribution in the cochlea is site specific, and the infiltration level is positively associated with noise intensity. Moreover, neutrophils are short lived and macrophage phagocytosis plays a role in neutrophil clearance, consistent with typical neutrophil dynamics in inflamed non-cochlear tissues. Importantly, our study reveals the potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss and sensory cell loss in <i>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice. In wild-type control mice (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) exposed to the same noise, we also found neutrophils. However, neutrophils were present primarily inside the microvessels of the cochlea, with only a few in the cochlear tissues. Collectively, our data implicate CX3CR1-mediated signaling in controlling neutrophil migration from the circulation into cochlear tissues and provide a better understanding of the impacts of neutrophils on cochlear responses to acoustic injury.</p>

<p>Based on sleep functional connectivity (FC) analysis, the higher inter-hemispheric FC and lower intra-hemispherical FC were found in patients with depression, and cross-within variation was constructed to characterize the unbalanced functional network, the potential of which as a biomarker was further verified. Additionally, the inter-hemispheric temporal lobe connections in theta band also displayed high discriminative power.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a common mental illness and a large number of researchers have been still devoted to exploring effective biomarkers for the identification of depression. Few researches have been conducted on functional connectivity (FC) during sleep in depression. In this paper, a novel depression characterization is proposed using specific spatial FC features of sleep electroencephalography (EEG). Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 26 healthy individuals and 25 patients with depression. The weighted phase lag indexes (WPLIs) of four frequency bands and five sleep periods were obtained from 16 EEG channels. The high discriminative connections extracted via feature evaluation and the cross-within variation (CW)—the spatial feature constructed to characterize the different performances in inter- and intra-hemispheric FC based on WPLIs, were utilized to classify patients and normal controls. The results showed that enhanced average FC and spatial differences, higher inter-hemispheric FC and lower intra-hemispheric FC, were found in patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in the inter-hemispheric connections of the temporal lobe in the theta band should be important indicators of depression. Finally, both CW and high discriminative WPLI features performed well in depression screening and CW was more specific for characterizing abnormal cortical EEG performance of depression. Our work investigated and characterized the abnormalities in sleep cortical activity in patients with depression, and may provide potential biomarkers for assisting with depression identification and new insights into the understanding of pathological mechanisms in depression.</p>

                Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) with multiple functions in health and disease. Their response during encephalitis depends on whether inflammation is triggered in a sterile or infectious manner, and in the latter case on the type of the infecting pathogen. Even though recent technological innovations advanced the understanding of the broad spectrum of microglia responses during viral encephalitis (VE), it is not entirely clear which microglia gene expression profiles are associated with antiviral and detrimental activities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chloride-dependent mechanisms of multimodal sensory discrimination and neuropathic sensitization in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Individual sensory neurons can be tuned to many stimuli, each driving unique, stimulus-relevant behaviors, and the ability of multimodal nociceptor neurons to discriminate between potentially harmful and innocuous stimuli is broadly important for organismal survival. Moreover, disruptions in the capacity to differentiate between noxious and innocuous stimuli can result in neuropathic pain. Drosophila larval Class III (CIII) neurons are peripheral noxious cold nociceptors and gentle touch mechanosensors; high levels of activation drive cold-evoked contraction (CT) behavior, while low levels of activation result in a suite of touch-associated behaviors. However, it is unknown what molecular factors underlie CIII multimodality. Here, we show that the TMEM16/anoctamins subdued and white walker (wwk; CG15270) are required for cold-evoked CT, but not for touch-associated behavior, indicating a conserved role for anoctamins in nociception. We also evidence that CIII neurons make use of atypical depolarizing chloride currents to encode cold, and that overexpression of ncc69 - a fly homologue of NKCC1 - results in phenotypes consistent with neuropathic sensitization, including behavioral hypersensitization and spontaneous nociceptor activity, making Drosophila CIII neurons a candidate system for future studies of the basic mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leptin-mediated suppression of food intake by conserved Glp1r-expressing neurons prevents obesity</a></h4>

              
                The adipose-derived hormone leptin acts via its receptor (LepRb) in the brain to control energy balance. A previously unidentified population of GABAergic hypothalamic LepRb neurons plays key roles in the restraint of food intake and body weight by leptin. To identify markers for candidate populations of LepRb neurons in an unbiased manner, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of enriched mouse hypothalamic LepRb cells, as well as with total hypothalamic cells from multiple mammalian species. In addition to identifying known LepRb neuron types, this analysis identified several previously unrecognized populations of hypothalamic LepRb neurons. Many of these populations display strong conservation across species, including GABAergic Glp1r-expressing LepRb (LepRbGlp1r) neurons that express more Lepr and respond more robustly to exogenous leptin than other LepRb populations. Ablating LepRb from these cells provoked hyperphagic obesity without impairing energy expenditure. Conversely, reactivating LepRb in Glp1r-expressing cells decreased food intake and body weight in otherwise LepRb-null mice. Furthermore, LepRb reactivation in GABA neurons improved energy balance in LepRb-null mice, and this effect required the expression of LepRb in GABAergic Glp1r-expressing neurons. Thus, the conserved GABAergic LepRbGlp1r neuron population plays crucial roles in the control of food intake and body weight by leptin.

                Disturbances in the brain fluid balance can lead to life-threatening elevation in the intracranial pressure (ICP), which represents a vast clinical challenge. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion are largely unresolved, thus preventing targeted and efficient pharmaceutical therapy of cerebral pathologies involving elevated ICP. Here, we employed experimental rats to demonstrate low osmotic water permeability of the choroid plexus, lack of an osmotic gradient across this tissue, and robust CSF secretion against osmotic gradients. Together, these results illustrate that CSF secretion occurs independently of conventional osmosis, which challenges the existing assumption that CSF production is driven entirely by bulk osmotic forces across the CSF-secreting choroid plexus. Instead, we reveal that the choroidal Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter NKCC1, Na+/HCO3- cotransporter NBCe2, and Na+/K+-ATPase are actively involved in CSF production and propose a molecular mode of water transport supporting CSF production in this secretory tissue. Further, we demonstrate that inhibition of NKCC1 directly reduces the ICP, illustrating that altered CSF secretion may be employed as a strategy to modulate ICP. These insights identify new promising therapeutic targets against brain pathologies associated with elevated ICP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic heterogeneity of Sox2-expressing pituitary cells</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian pituitary gland is a complex organ consisting of hormone-producing cells (HPC), nonhormonal folliculostellate cells (FSC) and pituicytes, vascular pericytes and endothelial cells, and putative Sox2-expressing stem cells. Here, we used scRNAseq analysis of adult female rat pituitary cells to study the heterogeneity of pituitary cells with a focus on evaluating the transcriptomic profile of the Sox2-expressing population. Samples containing whole pituitary and separated anterior and posterior lobe cells allowed the identification of all expected pituitary resident cell types and lobe-specific subpopulations of vascular cells. Sox2 was expressed uniformly in all FSC, pituicytes, and a fraction of HPC. FSC comprised two subclusters; FSC1 contained more cells but expressed less genetic diversity compared to FSC2. The latter contained proliferative cells, expressed genes consistent with stem cell niche formation, including tight junctions, and shared genes with HPC. The FSC2 transcriptome profile was also consistent with the activity of pathways regulating cell proliferation and stem cell pluripotency, including the Hippo and Wnt pathways. The expression of other stem cell marker genes was common for FSC and pituicytes (Sox9, Cd9, Hes1, Vim, S100b) or cell type-specific (FSC: Prop1, Prrx1, Pitx1, Pitx2, Lhx3; pituicytes: Fgf10, Tbx3, Lhx2, Nkx2-1, Rax). FSC and pituicytes also expressed other astroglial marker genes, some common and other distinct, consistent with their identities as astroglial cells of the pituitary. These data suggest functional heterogeneity of FSC, with a larger fraction representing classical FSC, and a smaller fraction containing active stem-like cells and HPC-committed progenitors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Develop an efficient and specific AAV-based labeling system for Muller glia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cell degeneration in the retina leads to several ocular diseases and vision loss. Considerable research efforts focus on reprogramming Muller glia (MG) into functional cells to rescue vision as a promising therapeutic strategy, although whether MG can convert into functional amacrine cells, bipolar cells, retinal ganglia cells (RGCs), rods or cones in mammals remains controversial. The broad applicability of tracking MG differentiation thus presents a need for improved labeling efficiency and specificity. Here, we compared AAV-based labeling strategies with conventional lineage-tracking by crossing transgenic mouse lines. We found that reporter expression was weak and not MG-specific in mGFAP-Cre transgenic mice. Different AAV serotypes showed a range of efficiency and specificity in labeling MG, leading us to optimize a human GFAP-Cre reporter system packaged in the AAV9 serotype with the WPRE (WPRE, woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element) removed. The hGFAP-Cre- {Delta}WPRE reporter could label 20-73.8% MGs, with non-specific RGC labeling rates ranging from 0-0.08% at doses of 1 X 108 to 1010 vector genomes (vg) per eye, an approximate 40-fold reduction compared with the AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-WPRE labeling system. The AAV9-hGFAP- Cre-{Delta}WPRE system thus represents a highly efficient and specific labeling system for Muller glia, providing a valuable tool for tracking cell fate in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine D2Rs Coordinate Cue-Evoked Changes in Striatal Acetylcholine Levels</a></h4>

              
                In the striatum, acetylcholine (ACh) neuron activity is modulated co-incident with dopamine (DA) release in response to unpredicted rewards and reward predicting cues and both neuromodulators are thought to regulate each other. While this co-regulation has been studied using stimulation studies, the existence of this mutual regulation in vivo during natural behavior is still largely unexplored. One long-standing controversy has been whether striatal DA is responsible for the induction of the cholinergic pause or whether D2R modulate a pause that is induced by other mechanisms. Here, we used genetically encoded sensors in combination with pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs from cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to simultaneously measure ACh and DA levels after CIN D2R inactivation. We found that CIN D2Rs are not necessary for the induction of cue induced dips in ACh levels but regulate dip lengths and rebound ACh levels. Importantly, D2R inactivation strongly decreased the temporal correlation between DA and Ach signals not only at cue presentation but also during the intertrial interval. This points to a general mechanism by which D2Rs coordinate both signals. At the behavioral level D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press, which was not observed in CIN-selective D2R knock out mice. This latency correlated with the cue evoked dip length supporting a role of the ACh dip and its regulation by D2Rs in motivated behavior. Overall, our data indicate that striatal DA coordinate phasic ACh and DA signals via CIN D2Rs which is important for the regulation of motivated behavior.

                The brain continuously coordinates skeletomuscular movements with internal physiological states like arousal, but how is this coordination achieved? One possibility is that brain simply reacts to changes in external and/or internal signals. Another possibility is that it is actively coordinating both external and internal activities. We used functional ultrasound imaging to capture a large medial section of the brain, including multiple cortical and subcortical areas, in marmoset monkeys while monitoring their spontaneous movements and cardiac activity. By analyzing the causal ordering of these different time-series, we found that information flowing from the brain to movements and heart rate fluctuations were significantly greater than in the opposite direction. The brain areas involved in this external versus internal coordination were spatially distinct but also extensively interconnected. Temporally, the brain alternated between network states for this regulation. These findings suggest that the brain's dynamics actively and efficiently coordinate motor behavior with internal physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioural consequences of Setd1a haploinsufficiency in mice: evidence for heightened emotional reactivity and impaired sensorimotor gating</a></h4>

              
                A number of studies implicate the loss of function (LoF) mutations affecting the histone methyl transferase SETD1A in the aetiology of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia. Here, we examined the behavioural consequences of haploinsufficiency of Setd1a in a mouse model. We find evidence for changes in a number of phenotypes of relevance to schizophrenia, including increased anxiety-related behaviour, enhanced acoustic startle response, and decreased pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle. The sensorimotor gating deficits in Setd1a+/- mice could not be rescued by haloperidol or risperidone, suggesting that these antipsychotics are ineffective for ameliorating schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes in Setd1a+/- mice and point to deficits in neural systems other than the monoamine system. These phenotypes are emerging as key features of a number of other mouse models of rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by LoF mutations in genes encoding epigenome modifiers suggesting they may act in a network to modulate brain development. Taken together these data strengthen the support for the use of Setd1a haploinsufficient mice as a model for the biological basis of schizophrenia, and point towards possible underpinning neural mechanisms.

                We interrogated prefrontal circuit function in mice lacking Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (Disc1-mutant mice), a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Single-unit recordings in awake mice revealed reduced average firing rates of fast-spiking interneurons (INTs), including optogenetically identified parvalbumin-positive cells, and a lower proportion of INTs phase-coupled to ongoing gamma oscillations. Moreover, we observed decreased spike transmission efficacy at local pyramidal cell (PYR)-INT connections in vivo, suggesting a reduced excitatory effect of local glutamatergic inputs as a potential mechanism of lower INT rates. On the network level, impaired INT function resulted in altered activation of PYR assemblies: While assembly activations were observed equally often, the expression strength of individual assembly patterns was significantly higher in Disc1-mutant mice. Our data thus reveal a role of Disc1 in shaping the properties of prefrontal assembly patterns by setting prefrontal INT responsiveness to glutamatergic drive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust regulatory architecture of pan-neuronal gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Pan-neuronally expressed genes, such as genes involved in the synaptic vesicle release cycle or in neuropeptide maturation, are critical for proper function of all neurons, but the transcriptional control mechanisms that direct such genes to all neurons of a nervous system remain poorly understood. We show here that six members of the CUT family of homeobox genes control pan-neuronal identity specification in C. elegans. Single CUT mutants show barely any effects on pan-neuronal gene expression or global nervous system function, but such effects become apparent and progressively worsen upon removal of additional CUT family members, indicating a critical role of gene dosage. Overexpression of each individual CUT gene rescued the phenotype of compound mutants, corroborating that gene dosage, rather than the activity of specific members of the gene family, is critical for CUT gene function. Genome-wide binding profiles as well as mutation of CUT binding sites by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering show that CUT genes directly control the expression of pan-neuronal features. Moreover, CUT genes act in conjunction with neuron-type specific transcription factors to control pan-neuronal gene expression. Our study, therefore, provides a previously missing key insight into how neuronal gene expression programs are specified and reveals a highly buffered and robust mechanism that controls the most critical functional features of all neuronal cell types.

	<p>The human brain is constantly active, even at rest. Alpha coherence is an electroencephalography (EEG) rhythm that regulates functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, the relationships between resting-state alpha coherence and N2/P3 components associated with response inhibition and cognitive processes have not been investigated in addictive disorders. The present study investigated the relationships between alpha coherence during the resting state and N2/P3 components of event-related potentials during the Go/Nogo task in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). A total of 64 young adults (HC: n = 31; IGD: n = 33) participated in this study. Alpha coherence values at left fronto-central and bilateral centro-temporal electrode sites were significantly correlated with P3 latency in HCs, whereas inverse correlations were observed in patients with IGD. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the correlation values between the groups. Our results suggest that patients with IGD lack dynamic interactions of functional connectivity between the fronto-centro-temporal regions during the resting state and the event-related potential (ERP) index during cognitive tasks. The findings of this study may have important implications for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms linking resting-state EEG and task-related ERPs underlying IGD.</p>

	<p>Aggressive behaviors and disruptive/conduct disorders are some of the commonest reasons for referral to youth mental health services; nevertheless, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in real-world clinical practice remains unclear. In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10&amp;amp;ndash;17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both &amp;amp;ldquo;cold&amp;amp;rdquo; (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and &amp;amp;ldquo;hot&amp;amp;rdquo; executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression. The paper describes the protocol of the clinical MATRICS WP6-1 study, its rationale, the specific outcome measures, and their implications for a precision medicine approach.</p>

	<p>The aim of the study was to find the association between SIRT1 concentration, SIRT1 rs3758391, rs3818292, rs7895833 polymorphisms and clinical manifestations of pituitary adenoma (PA). The study included 108 patients with PA and 216 healthy individuals. Using commercial kits, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. To determine the PA and control group subjects&#039; genotypes was used real-time PCR method, for SIRT concentration measurement we used ELISA method. The statistical data analysis was completed using the &amp;quot;IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0&amp;quot; software. Results: We performed statistical analysis of SNPs in the patient and healthy controls and patients&#039; subgroups and found statistically significant differences in rs7895833 genotype (A/A, A/G, G/G) distributions between the active PA and control groups (67.9%, 24.6%, 5.7% vs. 72.2%, 27.3%, 0.5%; p = 0.02) Also, the results showed that the rs7895833 G/G genotype is associated with about 13-fold increased odds of active PA development compared to the A/A (OR = 13.95% CI: 1.314&amp;amp;ndash;128.632; p = 0.028) and both A/A and A/G genotypes (OR = 12.9; 95% CI: 1.314&amp;amp;ndash;126.624; p = 0.028). There is ample evidence that SIRT1 in the pituitary and other target organs modifies the synthesis, secretion, and activity of hormones to trigger adaptive responses, thus we decided to include this in our study. When determining the serum concentration of SIRT1, we did not find a statistically significant difference between the PA group and the control group. SIRT1 serum level was statistically significantly higher in women with PA than in healthy control women (1.115 (3.748) vs. 136 (0.211); p = 0.008). To conclude - SIRT1 rs7895833 G/G genotype is associated with about 13-fold increased odds of active PA development compared to the A/A and both A/A and A/G genotypes. SIRT1 serum levels are higher in women with PA than in healthy women.</p>

	<p>There is increasing interest in identifying biological and imaging markers for the early detection of neurocognitive decline. In addition, non-pharmacological strategies, including physical exercise and cognitive interventions, may be beneficial for those developing cognitive impairment. The Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment (FIE) Program is a cognitive intervention based on structural cognitive modifiability and the mediated learning experience (MLE) and aims to promote problem-solving strategies and metacognitive abilities. The FIE program uses a variety of instruments to enhance the cognitive capacity of the individual as a result of mediation. A specific version of the FIE program was developed for the cognitive enhancement of older adults, focusing on strengthening orientation skills, categorization skills, deductive reasoning, and memory. We performed a prospective interventional pilot observational study on older subjects with MCI who participated in 30 mediated FIE sessions (two sessions weekly for 15 weeks). Of the 23 subjects who completed the study, there was a significant improvement in memory on the NeuroTrax cognitive assessment battery. Complete sets of anatomical MRI data for voxel-based morphometry, taken at the beginning and the end of the study, were obtained from 16 participants (mean age 83.5 years). Voxel-based morphometry showed an interesting and unexpected increase in grey matter (GM) in the anterolateral occipital border and the middle cingulate cortex. These initial findings of our pilot study support the design of randomized trials to evaluate the effect of cognitive training using the FIE program on brain volumes and cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Craniotomy involves procedures with high incidences of postoperative pain. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective a2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been shown to be beneficial in neuroanaesthesia. The purpose of this narrative review was to assess the effect and safety of dexmedetomidine given intraoperatively during anaesthesia compared to placebo and demonstrate the effect on acute postoperative pain in adult patients undergoing craniotomy. Literature published from 1996 until 2021 were analysed through a search of PubMed, Medline and Embase. Randomised controlled trials investigating intraoperative administration of Dexmedetomidine with evaluation of postoperative pain were included. Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text words were used to identify articles related to the intraoperative use of Dexmedetomidine and postcraniotomy pain. Thirteen distinct randomized controlled trials with 882 recruited patients undergoing craniotomy were identified as eligible for final inclusion. Intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is associated with decreased postoperative pain and opioid consumption, and it assures haemodynamic stability. Dexmedetomidine is an efficacious adjunct in craniotomy in adults, showing benefits in reduction of postoperative pain and analgesic consumption. Dexmedetomidine also offers haemodynamic stability. However, widespread methodological heterogeneity of the papers prohibits a valid meta-analysis.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Previous research has indicated that reward-paired cues can enhance disadvantageous risky choice in both humans and rodents. Systemic administration of a serotonin 2C receptor antagonist can attenuate this cue-induced risk preference in rats. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms mediating this effect are currently unknown. We therefore assessed whether the serotonin 2C receptor antagonist RS 102221 is able to attenuate cue-enhanced risk preference via its actions in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) or prelimbic (PrL) area of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A total of 32 male Long&ndash;Evans rats were trained on the cued version of the rat gambling task (rGT), a rodent analog of the human Iowa gambling task, and bilateral guide cannulae were implanted into the lOFC or PrL. Intra-lOFC infusions of the 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonist RS 102221 reduced risky choice in animals that showed a preference for the risky options of the rGT at baseline. This effect was not observed in optimal decision-makers, nor those that received infusions targeting the PrL. Given prior data showing that 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonists also improve reversal learning through the same neural locus, we hypothesized that reward-concurrent cues may amplify risky decision-making through cognitive inflexibility. We therefore devalued the sugar pellet rewards used in the cued rGT (crGT) through satiation and observed that decision-making patterns did not shift unless animals also received intra-lOFC RS 102221. Collectively, these data suggest that the lOFC is one critical site through which reward-concurrent cues promote risky choice patterns that are insensitive to reinforcer devaluation, and that 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonism may optimize choice by facilitating exploration.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In the retina, EAAT1 and EAAT2 are considered the major glutamate transporters. However, it has not yet been possible to determine how EAAT5 shapes the retinal light responses because of the lack of a selective EAAT5 blocker or EAAT5 knock-out (KO) animal model. In this study, EAAT5 was found to be expressed in a punctate manner close to release sites of glutamatergic synapses in the mouse retina. Light responses from retinae of wild-type (WT) and of a newly generated model with a targeted deletion of EAAT5 (EAAT5<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) were recorded <I>in vitro</I> using multielectrode arrays (MEAs). Flicker resolution was considerably lower in EAAT5<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> retinae than in WT retinae. The close proximity to the glutamate release site makes EAAT5 an ideal tool to improve temporal information processing in the retina by controlling information transfer at glutamatergic synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GCAEMDA: Predicting miRNA-disease associations via graph convolutional autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Li, Yu-Tian Wang, Cun-Mei Ji, Chun-Hou Zheng, Jian-Cheng Ni, Yan-Sen Su</p>

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs related to a number of complicated biological processes. A growing body of studies have suggested that miRNAs are closely associated with many human diseases. It is meaningful to consider disease-related miRNAs as potential biomarkers, which could greatly contribute to understanding the mechanisms of complex diseases and benefit the prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of extraordinary diseases. In this study, we presented a novel model named Graph Convolutional Autoencoder for miRNA-Disease Association Prediction (GCAEMDA). In the proposed model, we utilized miRNA-miRNA similarities, disease-disease similarities and verified miRNA-disease associations to construct a heterogeneous network, which is applied to learn the embeddings of miRNAs and diseases. In addition, we separately constructed miRNA-based and disease-based sub-networks. Combining the embeddings of miRNAs and diseases, graph convolution autoencoder (GCAE) is utilized to calculate association scores of miRNA-disease on two sub-networks, respectively. Furthermore, we obtained final prediction scores between miRNAs and diseases by adopting an average ensemble way to integrate the prediction scores from two types of subnetworks. To indicate the accuracy of GCAEMDA, we applied different cross validation methods to evaluate our model whose performance were better than the state-of-the-art models. Case studies on a common human diseases were also implemented to prove the effectiveness of GCAEMDA. The results demonstrated that GCAEMDA were beneficial to infer potential associations of miRNA-disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noise increases the correspondence between artificial and human vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica A. F. Thompson</p>

The best performing computer vision systems are based on deep neural networks (DNNs). A study in this issue of PLOS Biology shows that DNNs trained on noisy stimuli are better than standard DNNs at mirroring both human behavioral and neural visual responses.

This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study, arguing that noise-robustness, a property of human vision that standard computer vision models fail to mimic, provides an opportunity to probe the neural mechanisms underlying visual object recognition and refine computational models of the ventral visual stream.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Practices, awareness, and perception towards home-based COVID-19 management among the general population in south India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most patients with COVID-19 experience mild illness which can be managed in a home environment. This study was done to assess the perception, awareness and practices regarding home-based management of COVID-19 among the general population in India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done in May and June 2021. Data were collected using a Google Form. Results: Mean age of the 294 participants was 36.6 ± 12.1 years. Of these participants, 45 (15.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 anytime in the past. Among them, 37 (82.2%) underwent home-based management for COVID-19. Monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation was performed just once a day by 15.2% and 5.9% of COVID-19 patients respectively. Self-medication was practiced by 11 (29.7%) patients. Disposable face masks were worn by 23 (62.2%) patients beyond eight hours of continuous usage. The disposable type of face mask was not discarded despite becoming wet and cloth masks were worn by eight (21.6%) patients. Disposable gloves were only worn by 14 (37.8%) care providers of COVID-19 patients. As many as 10 (27%) patients were tested for COVID-19 after completion of home isolation. Awareness of all mild symptoms and signs of the disease were known to only 19 (6.5%) participants. Normal oxygen saturation in the blood was known to 40 (13.6%) participants. Just six (2%) participants were aware of the correct duration of home isolation in a symptomatic patient with COVID-19. The recommended duration of hand washing with soap and water was known to 102 (34.7%) participants. As many as 17.4% and 32.7% participants were not confident in using thermometer and pulse oximeter respectively. Conclusion: Practices, awareness and perception regarding certain essential measures in COVID-19 home management were found lacking among a number of participants. These need to be addressed by suitable training programs among the general population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Antenatal care visits performance among unmarried women in Indonesia: Does unintended pregnancy matter? A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Unmarried women who experience unintended pregnancy tend to hide their pregnancy and not attend pregnancy care services. The study analyzed the effect of unintended pregnancy on antenatal care (ANC) visits among unmarried women in Indonesia. Methods: The study employed secondary data from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) 2017. This cross-sectional study involved unmarried women aged 15-49 years old who gave birth in the last five years. The 2017 IDHS used stratification and multistage random sampling, and the task obtained 508 respondents as samples. The variables analyzed included ANC visits, unintended pregnancy, residence, age, marital status, education, employment, wealth, and health insurance ownership. The study used the binary logistic regression test at the final stage. Results: The results show that unmarried women who had an unintended pregnancy were 0.588 times more likely than those who did not have an unintended pregnancy to have ANC visits ≥ four times (AOR 0.588; 95% CI 0.587-0.588). The analysis indicates that unmarried women who have an unintended pregnancy in Indonesia are less likely to complete ANC visits. Apart from unintended pregnancy, the study found seven other independent variables as significant determinants of ANC visit performance: type of residence, age group, marital status, education level, employment status, wealth status, and health insurance ownership. Conclusion: The study concluded that unmarried women who experienced an unintended pregnancy in Indonesia were less likely to complete ANC visits.

                Aortic to right ventricular fistula formation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare complication. We describe the first case of an aorto-RV fistula after TAVR, conservatively managed, in a patient with concomitant aortic stenosis and wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Given that the underlying pathology may have implications, transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis screening in patients undergoing TAVR is warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Concomitant activation of GLI1 and Notch1 contributes to racial disparity of human triple negative breast cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Mortality from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is significantly higher in African American (AA) women compared to White American (WA) women emphasizing ethnicity as a major risk factor; however, the molecular determinants that drive aggressive progression of AA-TNBC remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that AA-TNBC cells are inherently aggressive, exhibiting elevated growth, migration, and cancer stem-like phenotype compared to WA-TNBC cells. Meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data of multiple AA- and WA-TNBC cell lines shows enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathways in AA-TNBC cells. Enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathway genes was observed in AA-TNBC. In line with this observation, analysis of TCGA dataset reveals a positive correlation between GLI1 and Notch1 in AA-TNBC and a negative correlation in WA-TNBC. Increased nuclear localization and interaction between GLI1 and Notch1 is observed in AA-TNBC cells. Of importance, inhibition of GLI1 and Notch1 synergistically improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in AA-TNBC cells. Combined treatment of AA-TNBC-derived tumors with GANT61, DAPT, and doxorubicin/carboplatin results in significant tumor regression, and tumor-dissociated cells show mitigated migration, invasion, mammosphere formation, and CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> population. Indeed, secondary tumors derived from triple-therapy-treated AA-TNBC tumors show diminished stem-like phenotype. Finally, we show that TNBC tumors from AA women express significantly higher level of GLI1 and Notch1 expression in comparison to TNBC tumors from WA women. This work sheds light on the racial disparity in TNBC, implicates the GLI1 and Notch1 axis as its functional mediators, and proposes a triple-combination therapy that can prove beneficial for AA-TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combined effect of cell geometry and polarity domains determines the orientation of unequal division</a></h4>

              
                Cell division orientation is thought to result from a competition between cell geometry and polarity domains controlling the position of the mitotic spindle during mitosis. Depending on the level of cell shape anisotropy or the strength of the polarity domain, one dominates the other and determines the orientation of the spindle. Whether and how such competition is also at work to determine unequal cell division (UCD), producing daughter cells of different size, remains unclear. Here, we show that cell geometry and polarity domains cooperate, rather than compete, in positioning the cleavage plane during UCDs in early ascidian embryos. We found that the UCDs and their orientation at the ascidian third cleavage rely on the spindle tilting in an anisotropic cell shape, and cortical polarity domains exerting different effects on spindle astral microtubules. By systematically varying mitotic cell shape, we could modulate the effect of attractive and repulsive polarity domains and consequently generate predicted daughter cell size asymmetries and position. We therefore propose that the spindle position during UCD is set by the combined activities of cell geometry and polarity domains, where cell geometry modulates the effect of cortical polarity domain(s).
