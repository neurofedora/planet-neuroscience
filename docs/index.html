                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538769v1?rss=1">SynQuant: An Automatic Tool to Quantify Synapses from Microscopy Images</a></h4>

Motivation: Synapses are essential to neural signal transmission. Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synapse imaging data, several issues prevent satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness for different neurites and synapses is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to constraints of experiments and availability of sensitive antibodies. The combination of these issues makes the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to accurately and reliably quantify synapses. Results: We present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real images in the presence of severe antibody diffusion, high heterogeneity, and large noise, our method was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods by a large margin. Finally, we show SynQuant reliably uncovers statistically significant differences between disease and control conditions in a neuron-astrocyte co-culture based model of Down Syndrome.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538736v1?rss=1">Necessary Conditions for Reliable Representation of Asynchronous Spikes Through a Single-layered Feedforward Network</a></h4>

Reliable propagation of firing rate, specifically slow modulation of asynchronous spikes in fairly short time windows [20-500]ms across multiple layers of a feedforward network (FFN) receiving background synaptic noise has proven difficult to capture in spiking models. We, in this paper, explore how information of asynchronous spikes disrupted in the first layer of a typical FFN, and which factors can enable reliable information representation. Our rationale is that the reliable propagation of information across layers of a FFN is likely if that information can be preserved in the first layer of the FFN. In a typical FFN, each layer comprises a certain number (network size) of excitatory neurons, leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model neuron in this paper, receiving correlated input (common stimulus from the upstream layer) plus independent background synaptic noise. We develop a reduced network model of FFN which captures main features of a conventional all to all connected FFN. Exploiting the reduced network model, synaptic weights are calculated using a closed form optimization framework that minimizes the mean squared error between reconstructed stimulus (by spikes of the first layer of FFN) and the original common stimulus. We further explore how representation of asynchronous spikes in a FFN changes with respect to other factors like the network size and the level of background synaptic noise while synaptic weights are optimized for each scenario. We show that not only synaptic weights but also the network size and the level of background synaptic noise are crucial to preserve a reliable representation of asynchronous spikes in the first layer of a FFN. This work sheds light in better understanding of how information of slowly time varying fluctuations of the firing rate can be transmitted in multi-layered FFNs.

Constraint-based modeling (CBM) is increasingly used to analyze the metabolism of complex microbial communities involved in ecology, biomedicine, and various biotechnological processes. While CBM is an established framework for studying the metabolism of single species with linear stoichiometric models, CBM of communities with balanced growth is more complicated, not only due to the larger size of the multi-species metabolic network but also because of the bilinear nature of the resulting community models. Moreover, the solution space of these community models often contains biologically unrealistic solutions, which, even with model linearization and under application of certain objective functions, cannot easily be excluded. Here we present RedCom, a new approach to build reduced community models in which the metabolisms of the participating organisms are represented by net conversions computed from the respective single-species networks. By discarding (single-species) net conversions that violate a minimality criterion in the exchange fluxes, it is ensured that unrealistic solutions in the community model are excluded where a species altruistically synthesizes large amounts of byproducts (instead of biomass) to fulfill the requirements of other species. We employed the RedCom approach for modeling communities of up to nine organisms involved in typical degradation steps of anaerobic digestion in biogas plants. Compared to full (bilinear and linearized) community models, we found that the reduced community models obtained with RedCom are not only much smaller but allow, also in the largest model with nine species, extensive calculations required to fully characterize the solutions space and to reveal key properties of communities with maximum methane yield and production rates. Furthermore, the predictive power of the reduced community models is significantly larger because they predict much smaller ranges of feasible community compositions and exchange fluxes still being consistent with measurements obtained from enrichment cultures. For an enrichment culture for growth on ethanol, we also used metaproteomic data to further constrain the solution space of the community models. Both model and proteomic data indicated a dominance of acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosarcinales) and Desulfovibrionales being the least abundant group in this microbial community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukP6-AaBg4" width="1" />

<p>by Dave Osthus, Ashlynn R. Daughton, Reid Priedhorsky</p>

The ability to produce timely and accurate flu forecasts in the United States can significantly impact public health. Augmenting forecasts with internet data has shown promise for improving forecast accuracy and timeliness in controlled settings, but results in practice are less convincing, as models augmented with internet data have not consistently outperformed models without internet data. In this paper, we perform a controlled experiment, taking into account data backfill, to improve clarity on the benefits and limitations of augmenting an already good flu forecasting model with internet-based nowcasts. Our results show that a good flu forecasting model can benefit from the augmentation of internet-based nowcasts in practice for all considered public health-relevant forecasting targets. The degree of forecast improvement due to nowcasting, however, is uneven across forecasting targets, with short-term forecasting targets seeing the largest improvements and seasonal targets such as the peak timing and intensity seeing relatively marginal improvements. The uneven forecasting improvements across targets hold even when “perfect” nowcasts are used. These findings suggest that further improvements to flu forecasting, particularly seasonal targets, will need to derive from other, non-nowcasting approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NREuF014noo" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Vestibulospinal neurons are organized into discrete groups projecting from brainstem to spinal cord, enabling vertebrates to maintain proper balance and posture. The two largest groups are the lateral vestibulospinal tract (LVST) group and the contralateral medial vestibulospinal tract (cMVST) group, with different projection lateralities and functional roles. In search of a molecular basis for these differences, we performed RNA sequencing on LVST and cMVST neurons from mouse and chicken embryos followed by immunohistofluorescence validation. Focusing on transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes, we identified TF signatures that uniquely distinguish the LVST from the cMVST group and further parse different rhombomere-derived portions comprising the cMVST. Immunohistofluorescence assessment of the CNS from spinal cord to cortex demonstrated that these TF signatures are restricted to the respective vestibulospinal groups and some neurons in their immediate vicinity. Collectively, these results link the combinatorial expression of TFs to developmental and functional subdivisions within the vestibulospinal system.</p><p><b>Significance statement:</b> The molecular underpinnings of hodological and functional subdivisions within brainstem-to-spinal cord projection neurons are poorly understood. Transcriptomic profiling is an important step towards obtaining a molecular characterization of individual projection neuron groups and identifying candidate genes potentially involved in their specification. Here we use this approach to identify transcription factor signatures conserved in mouse and chicken that distinguish the two major vestibulospinal projection neuron groups and define coherent subpopulations within them, using whole transcriptome sequencing and immunohistofluorescence combined with retrograde tracing.</p>

Abstract<p>Dynamical changes in the environment strongly impact our perception. Likewise, sensory systems preferentially represent stimulus changes, enhancing temporal contrast. In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations (<i>C<sub>t</sub></i>) can guide odor source localization, yet the neural representation of <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> has not been studied in vertebrates. <b>We have found that, in the mouse olfactory bulb, a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, enhancing the contrast between different concentrations.</b> These concentration change responses are direction selective: they respond either to increments or decrements of concentration, reminiscent of ON and OFF selectivity in the retina. This contrast enhancement scales with the magnitude, but not the duration of the concentration step. Further, <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</p><p><b>Significance</b> As an animal tracks an odor plume, concentration changes over time. Here we show that olfactory bulb neurons explicitly represent concentration changes between consecutive inhalations. This response property enhances temporal contrast, as in other sensory systems. Fine temporal spike patterns do not improve concentration change decoding. These signals may guide olfactory navigation in the natural environment.</p>

Abstract<p>Development of the nervous system relies on a balance between axon and dendrite growth and subsequent pruning and degeneration. The developmental degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons has been well studied in part because it can be readily modeled by removing the trophic support by nerve growth factor (NGF) <i>in vitro</i>. We have recently reported that axonal fragmentation induced by NGF withdrawal is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and here we address the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry required for developmental axon degeneration of mouse embryonic DRG neurons. Our results show that the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid family member 1 (TRPV1) cation channel plays a critical role mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in DRG axons withdrawn from NGF. We further demonstrate that TRPV1 activation is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is driven through protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) -dependent pathways that become active upon NGF withdrawal. These findings demonstrate novel mechanistic links between NGF deprivation, PKC activation, ROS generation and TRPV1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in sensory axon degeneration.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurons are equipped with the genetic means to degenerate, and a subset of peripheral neurons normally degenerate during embryonic development to establish a mature pattern. This beneficial neurodegeneration is regulated by signaling pathways that are only partially understood, yet share components with pathways that mediate pathological degeneration of crucial neural structures during adult diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Here, we identify TRPV1 as a key regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into axoplasm that is required for developmental degeneration modeled by NGF withdrawal from sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion <i>in vitro.</i> Crucially, we report that the TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is prompted by a signaling axis comprised of PKC-dependent NOX complex activation and ROS generation upstream of TRPV1.</p>

Abstract<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Here we show that low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) form central terminals of a certain class of synaptic glomeruli, where they are subject to presynaptic inhibition and establish synapses onto distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. These results prompt a revised interpretation of dorsal horn ultrastructure, and provide a basis for ultrastructural identification of C-LTMRs in future studies of the role of these fibers in somatosensation. Furthermore, our observations indicate that C-LTMR terminations are subject to complex regulation and are well-positioned to participate in integration of afferent signals that lead to percepts of affective touch and pain.</p>

<p>Extracting and detecting spike activities from the fluorescence observations
is an important step in understanding how neuron systems work. The main
challenge lies in that the combination of the ambient noise with dynamic
baseline fluctuation, often contaminates the observations, thereby
deteriorating the reliability of spike detection. This may be even worse in the
face of the nonlinear biological process, the coupling interactions between
spikes and baseline, and the unknown critical parameters of an underlying
physiological model, in which erroneous estimations of parameters will affect
the detection of spikes causing further error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a random finite set (RFS) based Bayesian approach. The dynamic
behaviors of spike sequence, fluctuated baseline and unknown parameters are
formulated as one RFS. This RFS state is capable of distinguishing the hidden
active/silent states induced by spike and non-spike activities respectively,
thereby \emph{negating the interaction role} played by spikes and other
factors. Then, premised on the RFS states, a Bayesian inference scheme is
designed to simultaneously estimate the model parameters, baseline, and crucial
spike activities. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can gain an
extra $12\%$ detection accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art MLSpike
method.

<p>Process-oriented theories of cognition must be evaluated against time-ordered
observations. Here we present a representative example for data assimilation of
the SWIFT model, a dynamical model of the control of spatial fixation position
and fixation duration during reading. First, we develop and test an approximate
likelihood function of the model, which is a combination of a pseudo-marginal
spatial likelihood and an approximate temporal likelihood function. Second, we
use a Bayesian approach to parameter inference using an adapative Markov chain
Monte Carlo procedure. Our results indicate that model parameters can be
estimated reliably for individual subjects. We conclude that approximative
Bayesian inference represents a considerable step forward for the area of
eye-movement modeling, where modelling of individual data on the basis of
process-based dynamic models has not been possible before.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11085">High gamma and beta band oscillations in left ventral posterior parietal cortex are regionally dissociated during verbal episodic encoding and recall. (arXiv:1901.11085v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has a unique role in memory retrieval:
fMRI and electrocorticography studies suggest that within the ventral PPC (VPC)
specifically, there is an anterior-posterior functional divergence between
externally-oriented and internally-oriented attention to memory (AtoM).
However, the role of VPC during verbal episodic encoding, and the relationship
between encoding- and retrieval-related activity, is less understood. Here we
show that activation within a subregion of VPC is doubly dissociated between
its anterior and posterior parts, during encoding compared to recall in a free
recall task. We found that regional activation defined by increased high gamma
power and decreased beta power oscillations during encoding and recall
correlated with recall success. During word encoding, iEEG sites that showed
this correlation were located anterior to those that showed deactivation.
Conversely, during word recall, sites that showed stronger correlations between
activity and number of words recalled were located more posteriorly. Our
results demonstrate the significance of high gamma and beta oscillations
suggesting a push-pull relationship between attention to external stimuli and
internal memories within left ventral PPC. Knowledge of this divergence of
function along the anterior-posterior axis within left ventral PPC may prove
useful for guiding brain stimulation strategies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43482">Temporal identity establishes columnar neuron morphology, connectivity, and function in a <i>Drosophila</i> navigation circuit</a></h4>

The insect central complex (CX) is a conserved brain region containing 60+ neuronal subtypes, several of which contribute to navigation. It is not known how CX neuronal diversity is generated or how developmental origin of subtypes relates to function. We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have similar axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies' capacity to perform celestial navigation. We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41043">Emergence of trait variability through the lens of nitrogen assimilation in <i>Prochlorococcus</i></a></h4>

Intraspecific trait variability has important consequences for the function and stability of marine ecosystems. Here we examine variation in the ability to use nitrate across hundreds of <i>Prochlorococcus </i>genomes to better understand the modes of evolution influencing intraspecific allocation of ecologically important functions. Nitrate assimilation genes are absent in basal lineages but occur at an intermediate frequency that is randomly distributed within recently emerged clades. The distribution of nitrate assimilation genes within clades appears largely governed by vertical inheritance, gene loss, and homologous recombination. By mapping this process onto a model of <i>Prochlorococcus'</i> macroevolution, we propose that niche-constructing adaptive radiations and subsequent niche partitioning set the stage for loss of nitrate assimilation genes from basal lineages as they specialized to lower light levels. Retention of these genes in recently emerged lineages has likely been facilitated by selection as they sequentially partitioned into niches where nitrate assimilation conferred a fitness benefit.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538546v1?rss=1">A primal role for balance in the development of coordinated locomotion</a></h4>

Mature locomotion requires that animal nervous systems coordinate distinct groups of muscles. The pressures that guide the development of coordination are not well understood. We studied vertical locomotion in developing zebrafish to understand how and why coordination might emerge. We found that zebrafish used their pectoral fins and bodies synergistically to climb. As they developed, zebrafish came to coordinate their fins and bodies to climb with increasing postural stability. Fin-body synergies were absent in mutants without vestibular sensation, linking balance and coordination. Similarly, synergies were systematically altered following cerebellar lesions, identifying a neural substrate regulating fin-body coordination. Computational modeling illustrated how coordinated climbing could improve balance as zebrafish mature. Together these findings link the sense of balance to the maturation of coordinated locomotion. As they develop, zebrafish improve postural stability by optimizing fin-body coordination. We therefore propose that the need to balance drives the development of coordinated locomotion.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538504v1?rss=1">Transposon-mediated, cell type-specific transcription factor recording in the mouse brain</a></h4>

Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in the regulation of gene expression, controlling everything from cell fate decisions to activity dependent gene expression. However, widely-used methods for TF profiling in vivo (e.g. ChIP-seq) yield only an aggregated picture of TF binding across all cell types present within the harvested tissue; thus, it is challenging or impossible to determine how the same TF might bind different portions of the genome in different cell types, or even to identify its binding events at all in rare cell types in a complex tissue such as the brain. Here we present a versatile methodology, FLEX Calling Cards, for the mapping of TF occupancy in specific cell types from heterogenous tissues. In this method, the TF of interest is fused to a hyperactive piggyBac transposase (hypPB), and this bipartite gene is delivered, along with donor transposons, to mouse tissue via a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV). The fusion protein is expressed in Cre-expressing cells where it inserts transposon Calling Cards near to TF binding sites. These transposons permanently mark TF binding events and can be mapped using high-throughput sequencing. Alternatively, unfused hypPB interacts with and records the binding of the super enhancer (SE)-associated bromodomain protein, Brd4. To demonstrate the FLEX Calling Card method, we first show that donor transposon and transposase constructs can be efficiently delivered to the postnatal day 1 (P1) mouse brain with AAV and that insertion profiles report TF occupancy. Then, using a Cre-dependent hypPB virus, we show utility of this tool in defining cell type-specific TF profiles in multiple cell types of the brain. This approach will enable important cell type-specific studies of TF-mediated gene regulation in the brain and will provide valuable insights into brain development, homeostasis, and disease.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538439v1?rss=1">Contextual cues as modifiers of cTBS effects on indulgent eating</a></h4>

Background: Prior studies have found that continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) targeting the left dlPFC results in reliable increases in consumption of calorie-dense food items. However, it is not known to what extent such effects are modified by cues in the immediate eating environment. Tempting environments (i.e., those saturated with appetitive eating cues) may lead to more reliance on cognitive control networks involving the dlPFC, thereby enhancing cTBS on eating. Objective/Hypothesis: The objective was to examine the extent to which cTBS effects on eating would be modified by contextual cues. It was hypothesized that cTBS effects on eating would be stronger in the presence of facilitating cues. Methods: Using a between-subjects factorial design, 107 adults were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) active cTBS + facilitating cues, 2) sham cTBS + facilitating cues, 3) active cTBS + inhibiting cues, 4) sham cTBS + inhibiting cues. Following stimulation participants completed a flanker paradigm and a taste test during which quantity consumed was assessed surreptitiously. Results: Findings revealed a significant interaction between stimulation and cue type (F(1,102)=6.235, p=.014), such that the effects of cTBS were stronger for those in the facilitating cue condition. Conclusions: The effects of cTBS on eating are strengthened in the presence of facilitating cues. Methodologically speaking, facilitating cues may be a functional prerequisite for exploring cTBS effects on eating in the laboratory. Substantively, the findings also suggest that facilitating cues in the eating environment may amplify counter-intentional food indulgence in everyday life via cognitive control failure.

The engineered AAV-PHP.B family of adeno-associated virus efficiently delivers genes throughout the mouse central nervous system. To guide their application across disease models, and to inspire the development of translational gene therapy vectors useful for targeting neurological diseases in humans, we sought to elucidate the host factors responsible for the CNS tropism of AAV-PHP.B vectors. Leveraging CNS tropism differences across mouse strains, we conducted a genome-wide association study, and rapidly identified and verified LY6A as an essential receptor for the AAV-PHP.B vectors in brain endothelial cells. Importantly, this newly discovered mode of AAV binding and transduction is independent of other known AAV receptors and can be imported into different cell types to confer enhanced transduction by the AAV-PHP.B vectors.

Mutations in KCNQ2, which encodes a pore-forming K+ channel subunit responsible for neuronal M-current, cause neonatal epileptic encephalopathy, a complex disorder presenting with severe early-onset seizures and impaired neurodevelopment. The condition is exceptionally difficult to treat, partially because the effects of KCNQ2 mutations on the development and function of human neurons are unknown. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem cells and gene editing to establish a disease model and measured the functional properties of patient-derived neurons using electrophysiological and optical approaches. We find that while patient-derived excitatory neurons exhibit reduced M-current early, they develop intrinsic and network hyperexcitability progressively. This hyperexcitability is associated with faster action potential repolarization, larger afterhyperpolarization, and functional enhancement of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels. These properties facilitate a burst-suppression firing pattern that is reminiscent of the interictal electroencephalography pattern in patients. Importantly, we were able to phenocopy these excitability features in control neurons only by chronic but not acute pharmacological inhibition of M-current. Our findings suggest that dyshomeostatic mechanisms compound KCNQ2 loss-of-function and lead to alterations in the neurodevelopmental trajectory of patient-derived neurons. Our work has therapeutic implications in explaining why KCNQ2 agonists are not beneficial unless started at an early disease stage.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538348v1?rss=1">Task errors drive memories that improve sensorimotor adaptation.</a></h4>

Traditional views on how humans adapt movements to perturbations of sensory feedback emphasize a fundamental role for automatic, implicit correction of sensory prediction errors. However, it is now clear that adaptive behaviour also involves deliberate, strategic movement corrections. Such strategic processes have recently been argued to underlie the latent retention of sensorimotor adaptation, evident in improved adaptation to previously encountered perturbations; a phenomenon termed savings. It remains unclear, however, whether savings results from prior experience of sensory prediction errors, task errors, or both. Here, we used perturbations of target locations and hand position feedback during reaching to dissociate the contributions of task and sensory prediction errors to latent sensorimotor memory. We show that prior learning to correct for task errors is required to improve adaptation to rotated hand position feedback, whereas a history of sensory prediction errors is neither sufficient nor obligatory for savings. A history of correcting for task errors, induced by experimentally perturbing the target location instead of perturbing sensory feedback of movement, improved adaptation to visuomotor perturbations that were never before encountered. Limiting movement preparation time further showed that this learning consists of two distinct components: 1) a strategic component that is flexible enough to facilitate corrective responses in the opposite direction, but that requires substantial preparation time, and 2) a set of inflexible, cached, stimulus-response associations between targets and reach directions, that can be expressed under time-pressure when similar task conditions are experienced. The results emphasise that adaptive responses to sensorimotor perturbations take multiple forms.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/538207v1?rss=1">Phantom limb pain intensity is associated with generalized hyperalgesia</a></h4>

After limb amputation, most amputees suffer from phantom limb pain (PLP). The mechanisms underlying this condition are complex and insufficiently understood. Altered somatosensory sensitivity (either heightened or lowered) might contribute to PLP. Recent studies have tested this assumption but mainly focused on the residual limb. However, altered somatosensation in PLP might be generalized. In this study, we applied quantitative sensory testing to 37 unilateral upper-limb amputees (23 with PLP, 14 without PLP) and 19 healthy controls. We assessed thresholds to heat pain (HPT), pressure pain (PPT), warmth detection (WDT), and two-point discrimination (2PDT) at the residual limb, a homologous point and the thenar of the intact limb, and both corners of the mouth. We did not find significant differences in any of the thresholds between the groups. However, higher PLP intensity was significantly related to lower HPT at all measured body sites except for the residual limb. At the residual limb, lower HPT were observed in more distal amputations and in amputees showing a higher degree of prosthesis use. Although WDT did by itself not significantly correlate with PLP intensity at any of the body sites, multiple regression analysis showed the highest multiple correlations with PLP intensity for a combination of high WDT and low HPT at the corners of the mouth. In this model, the combination of HPT and WDT shared 58% of the variance with PLP intensity. Other factors of potential importance, especially residual limb pain, were not significantly associated to any sensory threshold. We conclude that the intensity, but not the presence of PLP is positively associated with higher heat pain sensitivity. Since this association was observed at various, distributed body sites, we suggest that central mechanisms might be underlying such generalized hyperalgesia.

Information within the brain travels from neuron to neuron across synapses. At any given moment, only a few synapses within billions will be active and are thought to transmit key information about the environment, a behavior being executed or memory being recalled. Here we present SynTagMA, which marks active synapses within a ~2 s time window. Upon violet illumination, the genetically expressed tag converts from green to red fluorescence if bound to calcium. Targeted to presynaptic terminals, preSynTagMA allows discrimination between active and silent axons. Targeted to excitatory postsynapses, postSynTagMA creates a snapshot of synapses active just before photoconversion. To analyze large datasets, we developed an analysis program that automatically identifies and tracks the fluorescence of thousands of individual synapses in tissue. Together, these tools provide a high throughput method for repeatedly mapping active synapses in vitro and in vivo.

Axon ensheathment is fundamental for fast impulse conduction and the normal physiological functioning of the nervous system. Defects in axonal insulation lead to debilitating conditions, but despite its importance, the molecular players responsible are poorly defined. Here, we identify Ral GTPase as a key player in axon ensheathment in Drosophila larval peripheral nerves. We demonstrate through genetic analysis that Ral action through the exocyst complex is sufficient and necessary in wrapping glial cells to regulate their growth and development. We suggest that the Ral-exocyst pathway controls the targeting of secretory vesicles for membrane growth or for the secretion of a wrapping glia-specific factor that itself regulates growth. In summary, our findings provide a new molecular understanding of the process by which axons are ensheathed in vivo, a process critical for normal neuronal function.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/537951v1?rss=1">Trajectory of brain maturation in adolescent individuals at familial risk of mood disorder</a></h4>

Background: Accelerated biological ageing has been proposed as a mechanism underlying mood disorder, but has been predominantly studied cross-sectionally in adult populations. It remains unclear whether differential ageing/maturation trajectories emerge earlier in life, in particular during the neurodevelopmental period of adolescence, and whether they are associated with onset of mood disorder and/or presence of familial risk. Methods: Participants were young individuals (16-25 years) from the prospective longitudinal Scottish Bipolar Family Study (SBFS) with and without family history of mood disorder. All were well at time of recruitment. Implementing a structural MRI-based brain age prediction model, individual maturational trajectories were captured by the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age (brain-PAD) at baseline and two-year follow-up. Based on clinical assessment at follow-up, individuals were categorised into three groups: (i) controls who remained well (C-well, n=94), (ii) high familial risk who remained well (HR-well, n=73) and (iii) high familial risk who developed a mood disorder (HR-MD, n=38). Results: Results showed no differences in brain-PAD between groups at baseline or follow-up. However, we found negative trajectories of brain-PAD for HR-MD versus C-well ({beta}= -0.68 years, p&lt;.001) and versus HR-well ({beta}= -0.38 years, p=.01), and for HR-well versus C-well ({beta}= -0.30 years, p=.03). Conclusions: These findings suggest that within young individuals, onset of mood disorder and familial risk may be associated with a deceleration in brain maturation trajectory. However, without significantly differential status of brain maturation at follow-up, extended longitudinal research will need to show whether this marks the emergence of maturational lag.

Identifying and manipulating synaptically connected neurons across brain regions remains a core challenge in understanding complex nervous systems. RetroLEAP is a novel approach for retrograde trans-synaptic Labelling, Expression And Perturbation. GFP-dependent recombinase (Flp-DOG) detects trans-synaptic transfer of GFP-tetanus toxin heavy chain fusion protein (GFP-TTC) and activates expression of any gene of interest in synaptically connected cells. RetroLEAP overcomes existing limitations, is non-toxic, highly flexible, efficient, sensitive and easy to implement.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/537910v1?rss=1">Selective attention modifies weights of distinct visual signals in human decision making</a></h4>

The ability to decide on the basis of multiple goal-relevant signals while ignoring distractors is a hallmark of adaptive, intelligent behaviour. While attention and decision-making processes have been well characterised in isolation, little is known about how the two interact. To independently manipulate task relevance and information integration, we presented moving dots in both a cued (target) colour and an uncued (distractor) colour. Using electroencephalography, we recorded brain activity in human observers as they reproduced the average motion direction of two consecutively presented targets. Although completely spatially intermingled with the targets, the distractors had remarkably little influence on either behavioural or electrophysiological correlates of decision-making. Consistent with this, we found only target-related processing in a follow-up experiment which used frequency-tagging to individually monitor target and distractor processing. Our findings suggest that two task-relevant stimuli can be efficiently combined to inform decision-making, implying a previously undocumented coupling between attention and decision-making.

Astrocytes have emerged as integral partners with neurons in regulating synapse formation and function, but the mechanisms that mediate these interactions are not well understood. Here, we show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling between neurons and astrocytes is required for establishing structural organization and remodeling of cortical synapses in a cell type-specific manner. In the postnatal cortex, Shh signaling is active in a subpopulation of mature astrocytes localized primarily in deep cortical layers. Selective disruption of Shh signaling in astrocytes produces a dramatic increase in synapse number specifically on layer V apical dendrites that emerges during adolescence and persists into adulthood. Dynamic turnover of dendritic spines is impaired in mutant mice and is accompanied by an increase in neuronal excitability and a reduction of the glial-specific, inward-rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1. These data identify a critical role for Shh signaling in astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal activity required for sculpting synapses.

Understanding the function of different neuronal cell types is key to understanding brain function. However, cell type diversity is typically overlooked in electrophysiological studies in awake behaving animals. Here, we show that four functionally distinct cell classes can be robustly identified from extracellular recordings in several cortical regions of awake behaving monkeys. We recorded extracellular spiking activity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the frontal eye field (FEF), and the lateral intraparietal area of macaque monkeys during a visuomotor decision-making task. We employed unsupervised clustering of spike waveforms, which robustly dissociated four distinct cell classes across all three brain regions. The four cell classes were functionally distinct. They showed different baseline firing statistics, visual response dynamics, and coding of visual information. While cell class-specific baseline statistics were consistent across brain regions, response dynamics and information coding were regionally specific. Our results identify four waveform-based cell classes in primate cortex. This opens a new window to dissect and study the cell-type specific function of cortical circuits.

Background: Obesity has become a severe problem among the world's population with clearly increasing prevalence over the last decades. Because obesity is associated with several comorbidities (e.g. hypertension or cancer) it constitutes an increasing burden for the health care system. Correlations between obesity and cognition have been studied in humans with ambivalent results. Here, we studied the effects of obesity on hippocampus dependent learning and memory and cell morphology in a mouse model of obesity. Methods: The body mass of male and female Lep+/+ (wt) and Lepob/ob (ob/ob) animals with access to food and water ad libitum was measured between postnatal day 60-200 and animals with clear adiposity (4-6 months) were further analyzed. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was examined using phosphohistone H3 as a marker for proliferation, doublecortin as a marker for differentiation and caspase3 as a marker for apoptosis. Moreover, the density of dendritic spines on apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) were analyzed using Golgi impregnation. In addition, mice were subjected to the open field and Morris water maze test in order to analyze locomotor activity and spatial learning. Results: The body weight of ob/ob mice nearly doubled during the first 120 postnatal days. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced in ob/ob mice due to reduced cell proliferation. Dendritic spine densities in the hippocampal area CA1 were not altered in ob/ob mice. Four to six months old ob/ob mice showed reduced locomotor activity in the open field test but similar performance in the Morris water maze compared to control mice. Conclusion: Our data show that alterations in adult neurogenesis in leptin-deficient mice are not associated with an impairment in spatial learning abilities. Moreover, ob/ob mice are inconspicuous in the Morris water maze and do not display altered spine densities in the hippocampus, suggesting that obesity does not have a severe impact upon hippocampal neuronal plasticity and spatial learning.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/537712v1?rss=1">Modulating the human functional connectome using deep brain stimulation</a></h4>

Neuroimaging has seen a paradigm shift from a formal description of local activity patterns toward studying distributed brain networks. The recently defined framework of the 'human connectome' allows to globally analyse parts of the brain and their interconnections. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an invasive therapy for patients with severe movement disorders aiming to retune abnormal brain network activity by local high frequency stimulation of the basal ganglia. Beyond clinical utility, DBS represents a powerful research platform to study functional connectomics and the modulation of distributed brain networks in the human brain. We acquired resting-state functional MRI in twenty Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic DBS switched ON and OFF. An age-matched control cohort of fifteen subjects was acquired from an open data repository. DBS lead placement in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was localized using a state-of-the art pipeline that involved brain shift correction, multispectral image registration and use of a precise subcortical atlas. Based on a realistic 3D model of the electrode and surrounding anatomy, the amount of local impact of DBS was estimated using a finite element method approach. On a global level, average connectivity increases and decreases throughout the brain were estimated by contrasting ON and OFF DBS scans on a voxel-wise graph comprising eight thousand nodes. Local impact of DBS on the sensorimotor STN explained half the variance in global connectivity increases within the sensorimotor network (R = 0.711, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, local impact of DBS on the motor STN could explain the degree of how much voxel-wise average brain connectivity normalized toward healthy controls (R = 0.713, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, a network based statistics analysis revealed that DBS attenuated specific couplings that are known to be pathological in PD. Namely, coupling between motor thalamus and sensorimotor cortex was increased and striatal coupling with cerebellum, external pallidum and STN was decreased by DBS. Our results show that rs-fMRI may be acquired in DBS ON and OFF conditions on clinical MRI hardware and that data is useful to gain additional insight into how DBS modulates the functional connectome of the human brain. We demonstrate that effective DBS increases overall connectivity in the motor network, normalizes the network profile toward healthy controls and specifically strengthens thalamo-cortical connectivity while reducing striatal control over basal ganglia and cerebellar structures.

During sensorimotor learning, neuronal networks change to optimize the associations between action and perception. In this study, we examine how the brain harnesses neuronal patterns that correspond to the current action-perception state during learning. To this end, we recorded activity from motor cortex while monkeys either performed a familiar motor task (movement-state) or learned to control the firing rate of a target neuron using a brain-machine interface (BMI-state). Before learning, monkeys were placed in an observation-state, where no action was required. We found that neuronal patterns during the BMI-state were markedly different from the movement-state patterns. BMI-state patterns were initially similar to those in the observation-state and evolved to produce an increase in the firing rate of the target neuron. The overall activity of the non-target neurons remained similar after learning, suggesting that excitatory-inhibitory balance was maintained. Indeed, a novel neural-level reinforcement-learning network model operating in a chaotic regime of balanced excitation and inhibition predicts our results in detail. We conclude that during BMI learning, the brain can adapt patterns corresponding to the current action-perception state to gain rewards. Moreover, our results show that we can predict activity changes that occur during learning based on the pre-learning activity. This new finding may serve as a key step toward clinical brain-machine interface applications to modify impaired brain activity.

Anxiety disorders pose one of the biggest threats to mental health worldwide, yet current therapeutics have been mostly ineffective due to issues with relapse, efficacy, and toxicit. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders including anxiety, but very little is known about the effects of DBS on fear memories. In this study, we used a modified plus-maze discriminative and showed that DBS of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was able to disrupt consolidation, but not acquisition or retrieval of fear memories. We validated these results using a standard tone-footshock fear conditioning paradigm. We further demonstrated short-term changes in dopaminergic receptor and c-Fos expression in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and established a partial casual role of dopamine 2 receptors in this effect. Lastly, we showed changes in neurotransmitter levels in the vHPC. This study highlights the potential therapeutic effect of vmPFC DBS to treat anxiety disorders.

<p>by Dimitrije Marković, Andrea M. F. Reiter, Stefan J. Kiebel</p>

In our daily lives timing of our actions plays an essential role when we navigate the complex everyday environment. It is an open question though how the representations of the temporal structure of the world influence our behavior. Here we propose a probabilistic model with an explicit representation of state durations which may provide novel insights in how the brain predicts upcoming changes. We illustrate several properties of the behavioral model using a standard reversal learning design and compare its task performance to standard reinforcement learning models. Furthermore, using experimental data, we demonstrate how the model can be applied to identify participants’ beliefs about the latent temporal task structure. We found that roughly one quarter of participants seem to have learned the latent temporal structure and used it to anticipate changes, whereas the remaining participants’ behavior did not show signs of anticipatory responses, suggesting a lack of precise temporal expectations. We expect that the introduced behavioral model will allow, in future studies, for a systematic investigation of how participants learn the underlying temporal structure of task environments and how these representations shape behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvC8apYzGP4" width="1" />

The circadian oscillator, an internal time-keeping device found in most organisms, enables timely regulation of daily biological activities by maintaining synchrony with the external environment. The mechanistic basis underlying the adjustment of circadian rhythms to changing external conditions, however, has yet to be clearly elucidated. We explored the mechanism of action of nicotinamide in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a metabolite that lengthens the period of circadian rhythms, to understand the regulation of circadian period. To identify the key mechanisms involved in the circadian response to nicotinamide, we developed a systematic and practical modeling framework based on the identification and comparison of gene regulatory dynamics. Our mathematical predictions, confirmed by experimentation, identified key transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of circadian period and uncovered the role of blue light in the response of the circadian oscillator to nicotinamide. We suggest that our methodology could be adapted to predict mechanisms of drug action in complex biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vbjb0fubKc0" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of eight years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5Mb duplication event involving the gene <i>PMP22</i>.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina beadchips. Genome‐wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. <i>SIPA1L2</i> (signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using co‐immunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <i>in vitro</i> siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified significant association of four SNPs (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in <i>SIPA1L2</i> with foot dorsiflexion strength (P &lt; 1×10<sup>‐7</sup>). Co‐immunoprecipitation and mass‐spectroscopy studies identified β‐actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Further, we show that <i>SIPA1L2</i> is part of a myelination‐associated co‐expressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, <i>in vitro</i> knock‐down of <i>SIPA1L2</i> in Schwannoma cells lead to a significant reduction of <i>PMP22</i> expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions.</p>

Abstract<p>Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential (LFP) monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day 11 (P11) and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl<sup>-</sup> influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Febrile seizures are the most common neurological disorder in children. For the treatment of febrile seizures, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators are generally used and successfully supress seizures in most cases. However, it is still up for debate whether these drugs could depolarize immature neurons in the developing brain. Here, using a mouse model of febrile seizures, we show that high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators exacerbate the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of complex febrile seizures at postnatal day 11 but not at 14. We further found that the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter isoform 1 blocker bumetanide suppresses the phenotypes deteriorated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators. Thus, our findings suggest high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators possibly activate immature neurons.</p>

Abstract<p>Prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of neurobehavioral pathologies, including autism and schizophrenia. A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin and calbindin interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA. The combined insults lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits which parallel human psychopathologies that may be seen after extremely preterm birth. This new preclinical model supports a paradigm in which specific cellular alterations seen in preterm encephalopathy can be linked with a risk of neuropsychiatric sequela. Specific interneuron subtypes may provide therapeutic targets to prevent or ameliorate these neurodevelopmental risks.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Growing evidence suggests that a common component of psychiatric disorders is damage to inhibitory neurons. In the frontal lobe, these neurons continue to develop during late gestation and infancy, predisposing preterm survivors to neurobehavioral disorders and/or cognitive impairment. Preventing neuronal damage depends on having accurate models of preterm brain injury with well-defined outcome measures that can be examined in both small animals and humans. In this study, interneuron number were assessed in term and preterm human frontal brain tissues and in a novel multifactorial model that combines prenatal inflammation with postnatal hypoxia resulting in long-term inhibitory neuron loss. This new model was validated through anatomical and functional assessments that directly translate to human measures.</p>

Abstract<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. While we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types is statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> A major challenge in cancer chemotherapy is to effectively kill tumor cells while preserving healthy issue. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to side effects by anti-cancer agents. Agents that induce a recently identified type of cell death, called ferroptosis, are widely being considered for cancer treatment. However, precise understanding of how ferroptosis induction in cancer cells may simultaneously thwart function or viability of post-mitotic neurons is essential in defining the efficacy and toxicity of these agents. We show that mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells are similar to those in neurons. We leverage prior studies of ferroptosis in neurons to identify histone deacetylase inhibitors as agents that enhance chemotherapy-induced ferroptosis of tumors while inhibiting ferroptosis in neurons.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The biological mechanisms underlying complex forms of learning requiring the understanding of rules based on previous experience are yet unknown. Previous studies raise the intriguing possibility that improvement in complex learning tasks requires the long-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of the slow calcium-dependent potassium current (sI<sub>AHP</sub>) simultaneously in most neurons in the relevant neuronal networks in several key brain areas. Such sI<sub>AHP</sub> reduction is expressed in attenuation of the post-burst after-hyperpolarization (AHP) potential, and thus in enhanced repetitive action potential firing.</p><p>Using complex olfactory-discrimination (OD) learning as a model for complex learning, we show that brief activation of the GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor results in long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability in neurons from controls, but not from trained rats. Such an effect can be obtained by a brief tetanic synaptic stimulation or by direct application of kainate, both of which reduce the post-burst AHP in pyramidal neurons. Induction of long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability is mediated via a metabotropic process that requires PKC and ERK activation.</p><p>Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated by synaptic activation in neurons from GluK2 knockout mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex OD task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons results in remarkable enhancement of complex OD learning. Thus, signaling via kainate receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study we describe the molecular and cellular mechanism for complex learning.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that complex learning is accompanied by enhanced intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of a slow potassium current in most neurons in the relevant brain areas.</p><p>Using complex olfactory-discrimination (OD) learning we show that the kainate GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor is necessary and sufficient for complex learning.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Swathi Ayloo, Chenghua Gu</p><div><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a functional interface separating the brain from the circulatory system and is essential for homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>

<p>The NEURON simulator has been developed over the past three decades and is
widely used by neuroscientists to model the electrical activity of neuronal
networks. Large network simulation projects using NEURON have supercomputer
allocations that individually measure in the millions of core hours.
Supercomputer centers are transitioning to next generation architectures and
the work accomplished per core hour for these simulations could be improved by
an order of magnitude if NEURON was able to better utilize those new hardware
capabilities. In order to adapt NEURON to evolving computer architectures, the
compute engine of the NEURON simulator has been extracted and has been
optimized as a library called CoreNEURON. This paper presents the design,
implementation and optimizations of CoreNEURON. We describe how CoreNEURON can
be used as a library with NEURON and then compare performance of different
network models on multiple architectures including IBM BlueGene/Q, Intel
Skylake, Intel MIC and NVIDIA GPU. We show how CoreNEURON can simulate existing
NEURON network models with 4-7x less memory usage and 2-7x less execution time
while maintaining binary result compatibility with NEURON.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10962">A morphospace framework to assess cognitive flexibility based on brain functional networks. (arXiv:1901.10962v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Unfolding how the brain functionally shifts within the cognitive space
remains an unresolved question. From a brain connectivity perspective, there
exist two main concepts: cognitive shifts and cognitive flexibility. Although
the former is the proxy of the latter, the biggest challenge, in terms of
bridging these two concepts, lies in the fact that cognitive shifts are
governed by topological rules whereas cognitive flexibility is purely
numerical. In this paper, we bridge the aforementioned concepts while
preserving the complexity of cognition by proposing a formalism based on a 2D
network morphospace that quantifies trapping and exit characteristics of
network subsystems, naturally interpreted as functional communities. We show
that the constructed measurements reflect the emergent phenomenon of
higher-order cognitive states in addition to being able to quantify cognitive
flexibility, as a direct output. Leveraging this analytic framework, cognitive
shifts among traversedly integrated/segregated states of cognition are shown to
be projected from subject specific cognitive signatures. The evidence of
individual fingerprint emerged from cognitive flexibility domain legitimizes
the quest to explore the intrinsic relationship between flexibility of
functional networks and behavioral measures, including fluid intelligence. The
constructed multi-linear models using flexibility descriptors demonstrate an
above chance level of specificity. Finally, through the associations between
behavioral measures and flexibility theory, we found that frontoparietal (FP)
activation level, expressed through FP preconfiguration, and default mode
network (DMN) efficiency, expressed through DMN preconfiguration, are
positively correlated with all behavioral measures.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42722">Visualization of currents in neural models with similar behavior and different conductance densities</a></h4>

Conductance-based models of neural activity produce large amounts of data that can be hard to visualize and interpret. We introduce visualization methods to display the dynamics of the ionic currents and to display the models' response to perturbations. To visualize the currents' dynamics we compute the percent contribution of each current and display them over time using stacked-area plots. The waveform of the membrane potential and the contribution of each current change as the models are perturbed. To represent these changes over a range of the perturbation control parameter, we compute and display the distributions of these waveforms. We illustrate these procedures in six examples of bursting model neurons with similar activity but that differ as much as 3-fold in their conductance densities. These visualization methods provide heuristic insight into why individual neurons or networks with similar behavior can respond widely differently to perturbations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41250">Quantitative uniqueness of human brain evolution revealed through phylogenetic comparative analysis</a></h4>

While the human brain is clearly large relative to body size, less is known about the timing of brain and brain component expansion within primates and the relative magnitude of volumetric increases. Using Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods and data for both extant and fossil species, we identified that a distinct shift in brain-body scaling occurred as hominins diverged from other primates, and again as humans and Neanderthals diverged from other hominins. Within hominins, we detected a pattern of directional and accelerating evolution towards larger brains, consistent with a positive feedback process in the evolution of the human brain. Contrary to widespread assumptions, we found that the human neocortex is not exceptionally large relative to other brain structures. Instead, our analyses revealed a single increase in relative neocortex volume at the origin of haplorrhines, and an increase in relative cerebellar volume in apes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41129">Flexible nitrogen utilisation by the metabolic generalist pathogen <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i></a></h4>

Bacterial metabolism is fundamental to survival and pathogenesis. We explore how <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> utilises amino acids as nitrogen sources, using a combination of bacterial physiology and stable isotope tracing coupled to mass spectrometry metabolomics methods. Our results define core properties of the nitrogen metabolic network from <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, such as: (i) the lack of homeostatic control of certain amino acid pool sizes; (ii) similar rates of utilisation of different amino acids as sole nitrogen sources; (iii) improved nitrogen utilisation from amino acids compared to ammonium; and (iv) co-metabolism of nitrogen sources. Finally, we discover that alanine dehydrogenase, is involved in ammonium assimilation in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, in addition to its essential role in alanine utilisation as a nitrogen source. This study represents the first in-depth analysis of nitrogen source utilisation by <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and reveals a flexible metabolic network with characteristics that are likely product of evolution in the human host.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39065">Anillin regulates epithelial cell mechanics by structuring the medial-apical actomyosin network</a></h4>

Cellular forces sculpt organisms during development, while misregulation of cellular mechanics can promote disease. Here, we investigate how the actomyosin scaffold protein Anillin contributes to epithelial mechanics in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> embryos. Increased mechanosensitive recruitment of Vinculin to cell-cell junctions when Anillin is overexpressed, suggested that Anillin promotes junctional tension. However, junctional laser ablation unexpectedly showed that junctions recoil faster when Anillin is depleted and slower when Anillin is overexpressed. Unifying these findings, we demonstrate that Anillin regulates medial-apical actomyosin. Medial-apical laser ablation supports the conclusion that that tensile forces are stored across the apical surface of epithelial cells, and Anillin promotes the tensile forces stored in this network. Finally, we show that Anillin's effects on cellular mechanics impact tissue-wide mechanics. These results reveal Anillin as a key regulator of epithelial mechanics and lay the groundwork for future studies on how Anillin may contribute to mechanical events in development and disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38070">Generative modeling of multi-mapping reads with mHi-C advances analysis of Hi-C studies</a></h4>

Current Hi-C analysis approaches are unable to account for reads that align to multiple locations, and hence underestimate biological signal from repetitive regions of genomes. We developed and validated mHi-C, a multi-read mapping strategy to probabilistically allocate Hi-C multi-reads. mHi-C exhibited superior performance over utilizing only uni-reads and heuristic approaches aimed at rescuing multi-reads on benchmarks. Specifically, mHi-C increased the sequencing depth by an average of 20% resulting in higher reproducibility of contact matrices and detected interactions across biological replicates. The impact of the multi-reads on the detection of significant interactions is influenced marginally by the relative contribution of multi-reads to the sequencing depth compared to uni-reads, cis-to-trans ratio of contacts, and the broad data quality as reflected by the proportion of mappable reads of datasets. Computational experiments highlighted that in Hi-C studies with short read lengths, mHi-C rescued multi-reads can emulate the effect of longer reads. mHi-C also revealed biologically supported <i>bona fide </i>promoter-enhancer interactions and topologically associating domains involving repetitive genomic regions, thereby unlocking a previously masked portion of the genome for conformation capture studies.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The neural substrates of intelligence represent a fundamental but largely uncharted topic in human developmental neuroscience. Prior neuroimaging studies have identified modest but highly dynamic associations between intelligence and cortical thickness (CT) in childhood and adolescence. In a separate thread of research, quantitative genetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated that most measures of intelligence are highly heritable, as are many brain regions associated with intelligence. In the current study, we integrate these 2 streams of prior work by examining the genetic contributions to CT–intelligence relationships using a genetically informative longitudinal sample of 813 typically developing youth, imaged with high-resolution MRI and assessed with Wechsler Intelligence Scales (IQ). In addition to replicating the phenotypic association between multimodal association cortex and language centers with IQ, we find that CT–IQ covariance is nearly entirely genetically mediated. Moreover, shared genetic factors drive the rapidly evolving landscape of CT–IQ relationships in the developing brain.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In early blind individuals, brain activation by a variety of nonperceptual cognitive tasks extends to the visual cortex, while in the sighted it is restricted to supramodal association areas. We hypothesized that such activation results from the integration of different sectors of the visual cortex into typical task-dependent networks. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in blind and sighted subjects using tasks assessing speech comprehension, incidental long-term memory and both verbal and nonverbal executive control, in addition to collecting resting-state data. All tasks activated the visual cortex in blind relative to sighted subjects, which enabled its segmentation according to task sensitivity. We then assessed the unique brain-scale functional connectivity of the segmented areas during resting state. Language-related seeds were preferentially connected to frontal and temporal language areas; the seed derived from the executive task was connected to the right dorsal frontoparietal executive network; and the memory-related seed was uniquely connected to mesial frontoparietal areas involved in episodic memory retrieval. Thus, using a broad set of language, executive, and memory tasks in the same subjects, combined with resting state connectivity, we demonstrate the selective integration of different patches of the visual cortex into brain-scale networks with distinct localization, lateralization, and functional roles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although the central medial nucleus (CeM) of the thalamus is an essential part of the arousal system for sleep and anesthesia initiation, the precise mechanisms that regulate its activity are not well studied. We examined the role of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 isoform of T-type calcium channels (T-channels) in the excitability and rhythmic activity of CeM neurons during isoflurane (ISO)-induced anesthesia by using mouse genetics and selective pharmacology. Patch-clamp recordings taken from acute brain slices revealed that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in CeM are inhibited by prototypical volatile anesthetic ISO (250 and 500 μM) and selective T-channels blocker 3,5-dichloro-<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2). Both TTA-P2 and ISO attenuated tonic and burst firing modes, and hyperpolarized CeM neurons from wild type (WT) mice. These effects were greatly diminished or abolished in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Our ensuing in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings from CeM indicated that the ability of TTA-P2 and anesthetic concentrations of ISO to promote δ oscillation was substantially weakened in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Furthermore, escalating ISO concentrations induced stronger burst-suppression LFP pattern in mutant than in WT mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time the importance of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in thalamocortical oscillations from the non-specific thalamic nuclei that underlie clinically important effects of ISO.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In Parkinson’s disease, the degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons is consistently associated with modified metabolic activity in the cerebellum. Here we examined the functional reorganization taking place in the cerebello–cerebral circuit in a murine model of Parkinson’s disease with 6-OHDA lesion of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Cerebellar optogenetic stimulations evoked similar movements in control and lesioned mice, suggesting a normal coupling of cerebellum to the motor effectors after the lesion. In freely moving animals, the firing rate in the primary motor cortex was decreased after the lesion, while cerebellar nuclei neurons showed an increased firing rate. This increase may result from reduced inhibitory Purkinje cells inputs, since a population of slow and irregular Purkinje cells was observed in the cerebellar hemispheres of lesioned animals. Moreover, cerebellar stimulations generated smaller electrocortical responses in the motor cortex of lesioned animals suggesting a weaker cerebello–cerebral coupling. Overall these results indicate the presence of functional changes in the cerebello–cerebral circuit, but their ability to correct cortical dysfunction may be limited due to functional uncoupling between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A consensus on the number of morphologically different types of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex has not yet been reached, despite over a century of anatomical studies, due to the lack of agreement on the subjective classifications of neuron types, which is based on expert analyses of neuronal morphologies. Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of PCs can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical PCs. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The mammalian cerebral cortex is divided into different areas according to their function and pattern of connections. Studies comparing primary visual (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of primates have demonstrated striking pyramidal neuron (PN) specialization not present in comparable areas of the mouse neocortex. To better understand PFC evolution and regional PN specialization, we studied the tree shrew, a species with a close phylogenetic relationship to primates. We defined the tree shrew PFC based on cytoarchitectonic borders, thalamic connectivity and characterized the morphology and electrophysiology of layer II/III PNs in V1 and PFC. Similar to primates, the PFC PNs in the tree shrew fire with a regular spiking pattern and have larger dendritic tree and spines than those in V1. However, V1 PNs showed strikingly large basal dendritic arbors with high spine density, firing at higher rates and in a more varied pattern than PFC PNs. Yet, unlike in the mouse and unreported in the primate, medial prefrontal PN are more easily recruited than either the dorsolateral or V1 neurons. This specialization of PN morphology and physiology is likely to be a significant factor in the evolution of cortex, contributing to differences in the computational capacities of individual cortical areas.</span>

The multifaceted functions of the brain are borne through seemingly infinite spatiotemporal interactions between its resident neural elements. Using a combinatorial approach, Schuman and colleagues (J. Neurosci. 2018;39:125–139) recently identify four layer 1 cortical interneuron subtypes, including a hitherto uncharacterized neuron they term the ‘canopy’ cell. Properties unique to each of the subtypes likely endow them with distinct roles in top-down processing.

<p>by Itay Katzir, Murat Cokol, Bree B. Aldridge, Uri Alon</p>

Drug combinations are a promising approach to achieve high efficacy at low doses and to overcome resistance. Drug combinations are especially useful when drugs cannot achieve effectiveness at tolerable doses, as occurs in cancer and tuberculosis (TB). However, discovery of effective drug combinations faces the challenge of combinatorial explosion, in which the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of drugs and doses. A recent advance, called the dose model, uses a mathematical formula to overcome combinatorial explosion by reducing the problem to a feasible quadratic one: using data on drug pairs at a few doses, the dose model accurately predicts the effect of combinations of three and four drugs at all doses. The dose model has not yet been tested on higher-order combinations beyond four drugs. To address this, we measured the effect of combinations of up to ten antibiotics on <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> growth, and of up to five tuberculosis (TB) drugs on the growth of <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>. We find that the dose model accurately predicts the effect of these higher-order combinations, including cases of strong synergy and antagonism. This study supports the view that the interactions between drug pairs carries key information that largely determines higher-order interactions. Therefore, systematic study of pairwise drug interactions is a compelling strategy to prioritize drug regimens in high-dimensional spaces.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HjJA1n5znGo" width="1" />

<p>by Sulav Duwal, Laura Dickinson, Saye Khoo, Max von Kleist</p>

Currently, there is no effective vaccine to halt HIV transmission. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the drug combination Truvada can substantially decrease HIV transmission in individuals at risk. Despite its benefits, Truvada-based PrEP is expensive and needs to be taken once-daily, which often leads to inadequate adherence and incomplete protection. These deficits may be overcome by next-generation PrEP regimen, including currently investigated long-acting formulations, or patent-expired drugs. However, poor translatability of animal- and <i>ex vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> experiments, and the necessity to conduct long-term (several years) human trials involving considerable sample sizes (N&gt;1000 individuals) are major obstacles to rationalize drug-candidate selection. We developed a prophylaxis modelling tool that mechanistically considers the mode-of-action of all available drugs. We used the tool to screen antivirals for their prophylactic utility and identify lower bound effective concentrations that can guide dose selection in PrEP trials. While <i>in vitro</i> measurable drug potency usually guides PrEP trial design, we found that it may over-predict PrEP potency for all drug classes except reverse transcriptase inhibitors. While most drugs displayed graded concentration-prophylaxis profiles, protease inhibitors tended to switch between none- and complete protection. While several treatment-approved drugs could be ruled out as PrEP candidates based on lack-of-prophylactic efficacy, darunavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine could more potently prevent infection than existing PrEP regimen (Truvada). Notably, some drugs from this candidate set are patent-expired and currently neglected for PrEP repurposing. A next step is to further trim this candidate set by ruling out compounds with ominous safety profiles, to assess different administration schemes in silico and to test the remaining candidates in human trials.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WUqKyesJwDU" width="1" />

Gut microbiota and human relationships are strictly connected to each other. What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the “gut-human behavior axis” and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and “chrono-nutrition” play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JTUsq9HYq3M" width="1" />

<p>by Jordan J. Clark, Mark L. Benson, Richard D. Smith, Heather A. Carlson</p>

Understanding how ligand binding influences protein flexibility is important, especially in rational drug design. Protein flexibility upon ligand binding is analyzed herein using 305 proteins with 2369 crystal structures with ligands (holo) and 1679 without (apo). Each protein has at least two apo and two holo structures for analysis. The inherent variation in structures with and without ligands is first established as a baseline. This baseline is then compared to the change in conformation in going from the apo to holo states to probe induced flexibility. The inherent backbone flexibility across the apo structures is roughly the same as the variation across holo structures. The induced backbone flexibility across apo-holo pairs is larger than that of the apo or holo states, but the increase in RMSD is less than 0.5Å. Analysis of χ<sub>1</sub> angles revealed a distinctly different pattern with significant influences seen for ligand binding on side-chain conformations in the binding site. Within the apo and holo states themselves, the variation of the χ<sub>1</sub> angles is the same. However, the data combining both apo and holo states show significant displacements. Upon ligand binding, χ<sub>1</sub> angles are frequently pushed to new orientations outside the range seen in the apo states. Influences on binding site variation could not be easily attributed to features such as ligand size or x-ray structure resolution. By combining these findings, we find that most binding site flexibility is compatible with the common practice in flexible docking, where backbones are kept rigid and side chains are allowed some degree of flexibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gUvhEfpxopQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0393-18.2019v1?rss=1">Modes of accessing bicarbonate for the regulation of membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC) in retinal rods and cones</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup> dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bicarbonate accentuates the role of the membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, in phototransduction. In current research, bicarbonate rather than gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> is proven to be the ligand for ROS-GCs. Bicarbonate may be preferred because its movements are subject to tighter control. In rods, membrane impermeant bicarbonate gains entry at the synaptic zone and is cleared by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange at the outer segment. A novel insight is that while cones are similar, they also obtain bicarbonate at their outer segments and express an enzyme for making their own bicarbonate from endogenous together with exogenous CO<sub>2</sub>. Multiple pathways for access in cones indicate a need for greater uptake of bicarbonate and better buffering of its intracellular concentration than in rods.</p>

Abstract<p>The inter-regional connectivity of sensory structures in the brain allows for the modulation of sensory processing in manners important for perception. In the olfactory system, odor representations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are modulated by feedback centrifugal innervation from several olfactory cortices, including the piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nucleus. Previous studies reported that an additional olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, also centrifugally innervates the OB and may even shape the activity of OB output neurons. In an attempt to identify the cell-types of this centrifugal innervation, we performed retrograde tracing experiments in mice utilizing three unique strategies, including retrobeads, retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving a fluorescent reporter, and retrograde AAV driving Cre-expression in the Ai9 floxed transgenic reporter line. Our results replicated the standing literature and uncovered robustly labeled neurons in the ipsilateral piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and numerous other structures known to innervate the OB. Surprisingly, consistent throughout all of our approaches, no labeled soma were observed in the olfactory tubercle. These findings indicate that the olfactory tubercle is unique among other olfactory cortices in that it does not innervate the OB, which refines our understanding of the centrifugal modulation of the OB.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The perception of our environment relies upon the distribution of sensory information throughout brain regions. This is true in the olfactory system wherein projections between olfactory centers, including feedback centrifugal input to the olfactory bulb, provide the basis for olfactory perception. Here, we show that one olfactory cortical structure, the olfactory tubercle, is unique among olfactory cortices in that it lacks feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. This ‘negative result’ is important in that it refines current models for the circuitry of our olfactory system and challenges previous literature reporting such a pathway in fact exists.</p>

<p>Alcohol abuse leads to aberrant forms of emotionally salient memory, i.e., limbic memory, that promote escalated alcohol consumption and relapse. Accordingly, activity-dependent structural abnormalities are likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunctions that occur from suddenly ceasing chronic alcohol consumption. Here we show that alcohol-dependent male rats fail to perform an emotional-learning task during abstinence but recover their functioning by l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin (l-DOPA) administration during early withdrawal. l-DOPA also reverses the selective loss of dendritic "long thin" spines observed in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell of alcohol-dependent rats during abstinence, as well as the reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and postsynaptic density-95-positive elements. Patch-clamp experiments in NAc slices reveal that both <i>in vivo</i> systemic l-DOPA administration and <i>in vitro</i> exposure to dopamine can restore the loss of long-term depression (LTD) formation, counteract the reduction in NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents and rectify the altered NMDAR/AMPAR ratio observed in alcohol-withdrawn rats. Further, <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis experiments show that blunted dopaminergic signaling is revived after l-DOPA treatment during early withdrawal. These results suggest a key role of an efficient dopamine signaling for maintaining, and restore, neural trophism, NMDA-dependent LTD, and ultimately optimal learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Blunted dopamine signaling and altered glutamate connectivity in the nucleus accumbens represent the neuroanatomical basis for the impairment in aversive limbic memory observed during withdrawal in alcohol dependence. Supplying l-DOPA during withdrawal re-establishes synaptic morphology and functional neuroadaptations, suggesting a complete recovery of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic synaptic plasticity when dopamine is revived. Importantly, restoring dopamine transmission allows those synapses to encode emotionally relevant information and rescue flexibility in the neuronal circuits that process limbic memory formation. Under these conditions, drugs capable of selectively boosting the dopaminergic function during the "fluid" and still responsive state of the early withdrawn maladaptive synapses may help in the treatment of alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>Breast cancer patients using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as an adjuvant therapy often report side effects, including hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive impairment. Despite long-term use in humans, little is known about the effects of continuous AI administration on the brain and cognition. We used a primate model of human cognitive aging, the common marmoset, to examine the effects of a 4-week daily administration of the AI letrozole (20 μg, p.o.) on cognition, anxiety, thermoregulation, brain estrogen content, and hippocampal pyramidal cell physiology. Letrozole treatment was administered to both male and female marmosets and reduced peripheral levels of estradiol (E2), but unexpectedly increased E2 levels in the hippocampus. Spatial working memory and intrinsic excitability of hippocampal neurons were negatively affected by the treatment possibly due to increased hippocampal E2. While no changes in hypothalamic E2 were observed, thermoregulation was disrupted by letrozole in females only, indicating some impact on hypothalamic activity. These findings suggest adverse effects of AIs on the primate brain and call for new therapies that effectively prevent breast cancer recurrence while minimizing side effects that further compromise quality of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used as an adjuvant therapy for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and are associated with side effects, including hot flashes, depression/anxiety, and memory deficits severe enough for many women to discontinue this life-saving treatment. AIs are also used by men, yet sex differences in the reported side effects have not been systematically studied. We show that AI-treated male and female marmosets exhibit behavioral changes consistent with these CNS symptoms, as well as elevated hippocampal estradiol and compromised hippocampal physiology. These findings illustrate the need for (1) a greater understanding of the precise mechanisms by which AIs impact brain function and (2) the development of new treatment approaches for breast cancer patients that minimize adverse effects on the brain.</p>

<p>Alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was recorded from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call "target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression" or TELAS). In Experiment 1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two lateralized effects had different time courses and they responded differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS and N2pc reflect a related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The very first EEG studies demonstrated that alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG oscillations are suppressed when people attend to visual information and more recent research has shown that cuing an individual to expect a target at a specific location produces lateralized suppression in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, lateralized alpha may serve as a preparatory mechanism. In the present study, we found that a similar lateralized alpha effect is triggered by the appearance of a visual target even though the location could not be anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also serves as an active mechanism of target processing. Moreover, we found that alpha lateralization can be dissociated from other lateralized measures of target selection, indicating that it reflects a distinct mechanism of attention.</p>

<p>Sleep loss is associated with increased obesity risk, as demonstrated by correlations between sleep duration and change in body mass index or body fat percentage. Whereas previous studies linked this weight gain to disturbed endocrine parameters after sleep deprivation or restriction, neuroimaging studies revealed upregulated neural processing of food rewards after sleep loss in reward-processing areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. To address this ongoing debate between hormonal versus hedonic factors underlying sleep-loss-associated weight gain, we rigorously tested the association between sleep deprivation and food cue processing using high-resolution fMRI and assessment of hormones. After taking blood samples from 32 lean, healthy, human male participants, they underwent fMRI while performing a neuroeconomic, value-based decision-making task with snack food and trinket rewards following a full night of habitual sleep and a night of sleep deprivation in a repeated-measures crossover design. We found that des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were increased after sleep deprivation compared with habitual sleep. Despite similar hunger ratings due to fasting in both conditions, participants were willing to spend more money on food items only after sleep deprivation. Furthermore, fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala–hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep deprivation. Behavioral and fMRI results were not significantly correlated with changes in acyl, des-acyl, or total ghrelin concentrations. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after sleep loss might be due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epidemiological studies suggest an association between overweight and reduced nocturnal sleep, but the relative contributions of hedonic and hormonal factors to overeating after sleep loss are a matter of ongoing controversy. Here, we tested the association between sleep deprivation and food cue processing in a repeated-measures crossover design using fMRI. We found that willingness to pay increased for food items only after sleep deprivation. fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep deprivation. However, there was no evidence for hormonal modulations of behavioral or fMRI findings. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after sleep loss is due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/876?rss=1">Puncta of Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Mediate NMDA Receptor Signaling in the Auditory Midbrain</a></h4>

<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a neurotransmitter synthesized in the brain by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Using immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging in the inferior colliculus (IC, auditory midbrain) of the guinea pig (<i>Cavia porcellus</i>, male and female), we show that nNOS occurs in two distinct cellular distributions. We confirm that, in the cortices of the IC, a subset of neurons show cytoplasmic labeling for nNOS, whereas in the central nucleus (ICc), such neurons are not present. However, we demonstrate that all neurons in the ICc do in fact express nNOS in the form of discrete puncta found at the cell membrane. Our multi-labeling studies reveal that nNOS puncta form multiprotein complexes with NMDA receptors, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), and PSD95. These complexes are found apposed to glutamatergic terminals, which is indicative of synaptic function. Interestingly, these glutamatergic terminals express both vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 denoting a specific source of brainstem inputs. With <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings of multiunit activity in the ICc, we found that local application of NMDA enhances sound-driven activity in a concentration-dependent and reversible fashion. This response is abolished by blockade of nNOS or sGC, indicating that the NMDA effect is mediated solely via the NO and cGMP signaling pathway. This discovery of a ubiquitous, but highly localized, expression of nNOS throughout the ICc and demonstration of the dramatic influence of the NMDA activated NO pathway on sound-driven neuronal activity imply a key role for NO signaling in auditory processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the enzyme that synthesizes nitric oxide (NO), occurs as puncta in apparently all neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICc) in the auditory midbrain. Punctate nNOS appears at glutamatergic synapses in a complex with glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs), soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC, the NO receptor), and PSD95 (a protein that anchors receptors and enzymes at the postsynaptic density). We show that NMDA-R modulation of sound-driven activity in the ICc is solely mediated by activation of nNOS and sGC. The presence of nNOS throughout this sensory nucleus argues for a major role of NO in hearing. Furthermore, this punctate form of nNOS expression may exist and have gone unnoticed in other brain regions.</p>

<p>New memories are believed to be consolidated over several hours of post-task sleep. The reactivation or "replay" of hippocampal cell assemblies has been proposed to provide a key mechanism for this process. However, previous studies have indicated that such replay is restricted to the first 10–30 min of post-task sleep, suggesting that it has a limited role in memory consolidation. We performed long-duration recordings in sleeping and behaving male rats and applied methods for evaluating the reactivation of neurons in pairs as well as in larger ensembles while controlling for the continued activation of ensembles already present during pre-task sleep ("preplay"). We found that cell assemblies reactivate for up to 10 h, with a half-maximum timescale of ~6 h, in sleep following novel experience, even when corrected for preplay. We further confirmed similarly prolonged reactivation in post-task sleep of rats in other datasets that used behavior in novel environments. In contrast, we saw limited reactivation in sleep following behavior in familiar environments. Overall, our findings reconcile the duration of replay with the timescale attributed to cellular memory consolidation and provide strong support for an integral role of replay in memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons that are active during an experience reactivate again afterward during rest and sleep. This replay of ensembles of neurons has been proposed to help strengthen memories, but it has also been reported that replay occurs only in the first 10–30 min of sleep, suggesting a circumscribed role. We performed long-duration recordings in the hippocampus of rats and found that replay persists for several hours in sleep following novel experience, far beyond the limits found in previous reports based on shorter recordings. These findings reconcile the duration of replay with the hours-long timescales attributed to memory consolidation.</p>

<p>Neurons in the auditory cortex are tuned to specific ranges of sound frequencies. Although the cellular and network mechanisms underlying neuronal sound frequency selectivity are well studied and reflect the interplay of thalamocortical and intracortical excitatory inputs and further refinement by cortical inhibition, the precise synaptic signaling mechanisms remain less understood. To gain further understanding on these mechanisms and their effects on sound-driven behavior, we used <i>in vivo</i> imaging as well as behavioral approaches in awake and behaving female and male mice. We discovered that synaptic zinc, a modulator of neurotransmission and responsiveness to sound, sharpened the sound frequency tuning of principal and parvalbumin-expressing neurons and widened the sound frequency tuning of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary auditory cortex. In the absence of cortical synaptic zinc, mice exhibited reduced acuity for detecting changes in sound frequencies. Together, our results reveal that cell-type-specific effects of zinc contribute to cortical sound frequency tuning and enhance acuity for sound frequency discrimination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal tuning to specific features of sensory stimuli is a fundamental property of cortical sensory processing that advantageously supports behavior. Despite the established roles of synaptic thalamocortical and intracortical excitation and inhibition in cortical tuning, the precise synaptic signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we investigated these mechanisms in the mouse auditory cortex. We discovered a previously unknown signaling mechanism linking synaptic zinc signaling with cell-specific cortical tuning and enhancement in sound frequency discrimination acuity. Given the abundance of synaptic zinc in all sensory cortices, this newly discovered interaction between synaptic zinc and cortical tuning can provide a general mechanism for modulating neuronal stimulus specificity and sensory-driven behavior.</p>

<p>Perceptual decision-making is the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies. Most modeling analyses are based on statistical processes of accumulation of evidence. In contrast, very few works confront attractor network models' predictions with empirical data from continuous sequences of trials. Recently however, numerical simulations of a biophysical competitive attractor network model have shown that such a network can describe sequences of decision trials and reproduce repetition biases observed in perceptual decision experiments. Here we get more insights into such effects by considering an extension of the reduced attractor network model of Wong and Wang (2006), taking into account an inhibitory current delivered to the network once a decision has been made. We make explicit the conditions on this inhibitory input for which the network can perform a succession of trials, without being either trapped in the first reached attractor, or losing all memory of the past dynamics. We study in detail how, during a sequence of decision trials, reaction times and performance depend on nonlinear dynamics of the network, and we confront the model behavior with empirical findings on sequential effects. Here we show that, quite remarkably, the network exhibits, qualitatively and with the correct order of magnitude, post-error slowing and post-error improvement in accuracy, two subtle effects reported in behavioral experiments in the absence of any feedback about the correctness of the decision. Our work thus provides evidence that such effects result from intrinsic properties of the nonlinear neural dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Much experimental and theoretical work is being devoted to the understanding of the neural correlates of perceptual decision-making. In a typical behavioral experiment, animals or humans perform a continuous series of binary discrimination tasks. To model such experiments, we consider a biophysical decision-making attractor neural network, taking into account an inhibitory current delivered to the network once a decision is made. Here we provide evidence that the same intrinsic properties of the nonlinear network dynamics underpins various sequential effects reported in experiments. Quite remarkably, in the absence of feedback on the correctness of the decisions, the network exhibits post-error slowing (longer reaction times after error trials) and post-error improvement in accuracy (smaller error rates after error trials).</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/814?rss=1">Spatial Determination of Neuronal Diversification in the Olfactory Epithelium</a></h4>

<p>Neurons in the murine olfactory epithelium (OE) differ by the olfactory receptor they express as well as other molecular phenotypes that are regionally restricted. These patterns can be precisely regenerated following epithelial injury, suggesting that spatial cues within the tissue can direct neuronal diversification. Nonetheless, the permanency and mechanism of this spatial patterning remain subject to debate. Via transplantation of stem and progenitor cells from dorsal OE into ventral OE, we demonstrate that, in mice of both sexes, nonautonomous spatial cues can direct the spatially circumscribed differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons. The vast majority of dorsal transplant-derived neurons express the ventral marker OCAM (NCAM2) and lose expression of NQO1 to match their new location. Single-cell analysis also demonstrates that OSNs adopt a fate defined by their new position following progenitor cell transplant, such that a ventral olfactory receptor is expressed after stem and progenitor cell engraftment. Thus, spatially constrained differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons is plastic, and any bias toward an epigenetic memory of place can be overcome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spatially restricted differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons is both key to normal olfactory function and a challenging example of biological specificity. That the stem cells of the olfactory epithelium reproduce the organization of the olfactory periphery to a very close approximation during lesion-induced regeneration begs the question of whether stem cell-autonomous genomic architecture or environmental cues are responsible. The plasticity demonstrated after transfer to a novel location suggests that cues external to the transplanted stem and progenitor cells confer neuronal identity. Thus, a necessary prerequisite is satisfied for using engraftment of olfactory stem and progenitor cells as a cellular therapeutic intervention to reinvigorate neurogenesis whose exhaustion contributes to the waning of olfaction with age.</p>

<p>During development, neurons require highly integrated metabolic machinery to meet the large energy demands of growth, differentiation, and synaptic activity within their complex cellular architecture. Dendrites/axons require anterograde trafficking of mitochondria for local ATP synthesis to support these processes. Acute energy depletion impairs mitochondrial dynamics, but how chronic energy insufficiency affects mitochondrial trafficking and quality control during neuronal development is unknown. Because iron deficiency impairs mitochondrial respiration/ATP production, we treated mixed-sex embryonic mouse hippocampal neuron cultures with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) to model chronic energetic insufficiency and its effects on mitochondrial dynamics during neuronal development. At 11 days in vitro (DIV), DFO reduced average mitochondrial speed by increasing the pause frequency of individual dendritic mitochondria. Time spent in anterograde motion was reduced; retrograde motion was spared. The average size of moving mitochondria was reduced, and the expression of fusion and fission genes was altered, indicating impaired mitochondrial quality control. Mitochondrial density was not altered, suggesting that respiratory capacity and not location is the key factor for mitochondrial regulation of early dendritic growth/branching. At 18 DIV, the overall density of mitochondria within terminal dendritic branches was reduced in DFO-treated neurons, which may contribute to the long-term deficits in connectivity and synaptic function following early-life iron deficiency. The study provides new insights into the cross-regulation between energy production and dendritic mitochondrial dynamics during neuronal development and may be particularly relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are characterized by impaired brain iron homeostasis, energy metabolism and mitochondrial trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study uses a primary neuronal culture model of iron deficiency to address a gap in understanding of how dendritic mitochondrial dynamics are regulated when energy depletion occurs during a critical period of neuronal maturation. At the beginning of peak dendritic growth/branching, iron deficiency reduces mitochondrial speed through increased pause frequency, decreases mitochondrial size, and alters fusion/fission gene expression. At this stage, mitochondrial density in terminal dendrites is not altered, suggesting that total mitochondrial oxidative capacity and not trafficking is the main mechanism underlying dendritic complexity deficits in iron-deficient neurons. Our findings provide foundational support for future studies exploring the mechanistic role of developmental mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by mitochondrial energy production and trafficking deficits.</p>

<p>Hippocampus-dependent learning processes are coordinated via a large diversity of GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms. The α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R) is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus populating primarily the extrasynaptic domain of CA1 pyramidal cells, where it mediates tonic inhibitory conductance and may cause functional deficits in synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. However, little is known about synaptic expression of the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R and, accordingly, its location site-specific function. We examined the cell- and synapse-specific distribution of the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in the CA1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A) using a combination of immunohistochemistry, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation in hippocampal slices obtained from mice of either sex. In addition, the input-specific role of the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in spatial learning and anxiety-related behavior was studied using behavioral testing and chemogenetic manipulations. We demonstrate that α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R is preferentially targeted to the inhibitory synapses made by the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)- and calretinin-positive terminals onto dendrites of somatostatin-expressing interneurons. In contrast, synapses made by the parvalbumin-positive inhibitory inputs to O/A interneurons showed no or little α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Inhibiting the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in control mice <i>in vivo</i> improved spatial learning but also induced anxiety-like behavior. Inhibiting the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in mice with inactivated CA1 VIP input could still improve spatial learning and was not associated with anxiety. Together, these data indicate that the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated phasic inhibition via VIP input to interneurons plays a predominant role in the regulation of anxiety while the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R tonic inhibition via this subunit may control spatial learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit exhibits high expression in the hippocampus, and regulates the induction of synaptic plasticity and the hippocampus-dependent mnemonic processes. In CA1 principal cells, this subunit occupies mostly extrasynaptic sites and mediates tonic inhibition. Here, we provide evidence that, in CA1 somatostatin-expressing interneurons, the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit is targeted to synapses formed by the VIP- and calretinin-expressing inputs, and plays a specific role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, I arrived in Puerto Rico from New York City to establish a neuroscience laboratory and research program on extinction of conditioned fear. The lab's first research paper appeared in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i> (Quirk et al., 2000) and has been cited &gt;900 times. The success of this project in Puerto Rico far surpassed my original expectations. Therefore, I thought it might be useful to identify the factors responsible for this success, with the hope of facilitating the development of laboratories in diverse settings. A description of our lab practices is interspersed with personal statements from trainees hailing from Puerto Rico and other parts of Latin America. Creating an effective research and training environment depends less on the director's personality and more on the proper practice of activities that foster intellectual growth, such as journal clubs, lab meetings, and philosophy of science retreats. On a personal level, this project has been enormously gratifying. The unique environment in Puerto Rico fostered my best work, and I am very happy to have established my laboratory here.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10397">Minimax-optimal decoding of movement goals from local field potentials using complex spectral features. (arXiv:1901.10397v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>We consider the problem of predicting eye movement goals from local field
potentials (LFP) recorded through a multielectrode array in the macaque
prefrontal cortex. The monkey is tasked with performing memory-guided saccades
to one of eight targets during which LFP activity is recorded and used to train
a decoder. Previous reports have mainly relied on the spectral amplitude of the
LFPs as a feature in the decoding step to limited success, while neglecting the
phase without proper theoretical justification. This paper formulates the
problem of decoding eye movement intentions in a statistically optimal
framework and uses Gaussian sequence modeling and Pinsker's theorem to generate
minimax-optimal estimates of the LFP signals which are later used as features
in the decoding step. The approach is shown to act as a low-pass filter and
each LFP in the feature space is represented via its complex Fourier
coefficients after appropriate shrinking such that higher frequency components
are attenuated; this way, the phase information inherently present in the LFP
signal is naturally embedded into the feature space. The proposed complex
spectrum-based decoder achieves prediction accuracy of up to $94\%$ at
superficial electrode depths near the surface of the prefrontal cortex, which
marks a significant performance improvement over conventional power
spectrum-based decoders.

<p>We conduct a novel imaging genetics study of the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and genetic data
obtained from 112 subjects, where each subject is classified as either
cognitively normal (CN), as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or as
having Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) is fit to the
rs-fMRI time series in order to estimate a directed network representing
effective brain connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), a key
network commonly known to be active when the brain is at rest. These networks
are then related to genetic data and Alzheimer's disease in the first
genome-wide association study to use DCM as a neuroimaging phenotype.
</p>
<p>Our proposed pipeline is comprised of four sequential analyses linked
together with the objective of shedding light on the relationship between brain
connectivity and genetics in relation to disease. In the first stage, we
examine differences in effective brain connectivity across disease groups. In
the second analysis we relate the probability of disease to genetics and obtain
a set of priority single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially related to
disease. In the third analysis we investigate how effective brain connectivity
is related to the set of priority SNPs obtained in the second study. In the
fourth and final analysis we examine longitudinal data on changes with respect
to MCI and AD through a classifier in order to determine how well disease
progression can be predicted from the combination of effective brain
connectivity and genetic data. Our new pipeline for connectome genetics has
general applicability and its specific application to the ADNI study motivates
a number of future studies in this nascent area.

<p>A growing number of neuromorphic spiking neural network processors that
emulate biological neural networks create an imminent need for methods and
tools to enable them to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like
conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks are particularly
efficient when trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training
requires overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical
nature. This tutorial elucidates step-by-step the problems typically
encountered when training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader
through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the
spiking setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and
provides an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a
particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned
challenges.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36399">Gender inequalities among authors who contributed equally</a></h4>

We analyzed 2898 scientific papers published between 1995 and 2017 in which two or more authors shared the first author position. For papers in which the first and second authors made equal contributions, mixed-gender combinations were most frequent, followed by male-male and then female-female author combinations. For mixed-gender combinations, more male authors were in the first position, although the disparity decreased over time. For papers in which three or more authors made equal contributions, there were more male authors than female authors in the first position and more all-male than all-female author combinations. The gender inequalities observed among authors who made equal contributions are not consistent with random or alphabetical ordering of authors. These results raise concerns about female authors not receiving proper credit for publications and suggest a need for journals to request clarity on the method used to decide author order among those who contributed equally.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>SLC13A3</i> encodes the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3, which imports inside the cell 4 to 6 carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes, and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG) that was markedly increased and persisted over time. In one patient, increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful, and a genetic cause was suspected.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>WES analysis revealed variants in <i>SLC13A3</i>. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed in muscle tissue (c.1016 + 3A &gt; G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild‐type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate, and NAA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and <i>SLC13A3</i> mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy, for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis.</p>

Abstract<p>Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release was investigated in this study. Using in vivo microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested if the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The present study provides important information on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the exacerbating effects of E2 on addictive behavior by showing blockage of E2 receptors or mGlu5 reduces E2-induced potentiation of DA release in the rat striatum following by amphetamine injections. Our data suggest targeting E2 receptors or mGluRs could have treatment potentials for E2-related disorders in areas such as, but not limited to, drug addiction.</p>

Abstract
<p>The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR); therefore, S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded one to two weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The <i>in vitro</i> laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed that Layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from Layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits.</p>

Abstract
<p>Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal hippocampal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.</p>

Abstract
<p>The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.</p>

Abstract
<p>Preclinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge, we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) of male and female rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during SA; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.</p>

<p>Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&lt;2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transthyretin (TTR)‐related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in <i>TTR</i>. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at <i>ATXN1</i>, <i>ATXN2</i>, <i>ATXN3</i>, <i>ATXN7</i>, <i>TBP, ATN1</i>, <i>HTT</i>, <i>JPH3</i>, <i>AR</i>, and <i>DMPK</i>) was assessed by single and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centered approach, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For <i>ATXN2</i>, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = −8.81 to −2.19, <i>p</i> = 0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Length of normal repeats at <i>ATXN2</i> may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of <i>ATXN2</i> in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow‐up of presymptomatic carriers. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251–258.</b></p>

<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐β (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer disease pathology. We previously showed that OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1 to 4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance. Ann Neurol 2018 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:291–295.</b></p>

<p>Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the clinical impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in 3 patients with early onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in 2 patients and tumor embolization in a third). Our observations provide further in vivo evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura and have diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB]<sup>+</sup>, age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB<sup>+</sup> patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross‐modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or <i>APOE</i>. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid‐negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated the relationship between the interictal metabolic patterns, the extent of resection of <sup>18</sup>F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG‐PET) hypometabolism, and seizure outcomes in patients with unilateral drug‐resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) following anterior temporal lobe (TL) resection.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighty‐two patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, concordant <sup>18</sup>FDG‐PET hypometabolism, and at least 2 years of postoperative follow‐up were included in this 2‐center study. The hypometabolic regions in each patient were identified with reference to 20 healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). The resected TL volume and the volume of resected TL PET hypometabolism (TLH) were calculated from the pre‐ and postoperative MRI scans coregistered with interictal <sup>18</sup>FDG‐PET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Striking differences in metabolic patterns were observed depending on the lateralization of the epileptogenic TL. The extent of the ipsilateral TLH was significantly greater in left MTLE patients <i>(p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas right MTLE patients had significantly higher rates of contralateral (CTL) TLH (<i>p =</i> 0.016). In right MTLE patients, CTL hypometabolism was the strongest predictor of an unfavorable seizure outcome, associated with a 5‐fold increase in the likelihood of seizure recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 4.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–22.39, <i>p</i> = 0.04). In left MTLE patients, greater extent of resection of ipsilateral TLH was associated with lower rates of seizure recurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.004) in univariate analysis; however, its predictive value did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90–1.02, <i>p</i> = 0.19).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The difference in metabolic patterns depending on the lateralization of MTLE may represent distinct epileptic networks in patients with right versus left MTLE, and can guide preoperative counseling and surgical planning. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–10 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:241–250.</b></p>

[<sup>18</sup>F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>[<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities, including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (<i>p</i> = 0.006). [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Among 23 of 25 operated patients with &gt;1 year of follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia) and showed significantly lower [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>[<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R">Gamma‐aminobutyric acidergic transmission underlies interictal epileptogenicity in pediatric focal cortical dysplasia</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dysregulation of γ‐aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In vitro recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients who received operations for FCD were performed on multielectrode arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride cotransporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. Thirty‐six of 47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in proepileptic conditions in 6 of 8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling, as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker stopped them in 2 of 3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9 of 12 cases, revealing a Cl<sup>−</sup> dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 subcellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Altered chloride cotransporter expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals, and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co‐occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well‐validated measure of systemic vascular risk and <b>β</b>‐amyloid (A<b>β</b>) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office‐based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS‐CVD). We acquired A<b>β</b> (<sup>11</sup>C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F‐flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A<b>β</b> PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS‐CVD and A<b>β</b> as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, <i>APOE</i> ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between FHS‐CVD and A<b>β</b> burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS‐CVD and elevated A<b>β</b> burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (<i>p</i> = 0.16).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A<b>β</b> burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–8 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:272–279.</b></p>

<p>We investigated changes of after‐image duration in migraineurs and healthy controls (HCs) and throughout the migraine cycle to depict changes in the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium within the visual cortex. Forty‐seven episodic (EMs) and 39 chronic migraineurs (CMs; interictal) were compared to 34 HCs for visual after‐image duration. Additionally, seven EMs were investigated every consecutive day over 20 to 32 days using the identical paradigm throughout the migraine cycle. Interictally, the after‐image duration was shorter compared to HCs, but significantly longer in the ictal compared to interictal phase.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are linked to vascular risk factors and increase the risk of cognitive decline, dementia, and stroke. We here aimed to determine whether obesity contributes to regional WMHs using a whole‐brain approach in a well‐characterized population‐based cohort.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), systolic/diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes and smoking status, blood glucose and inflammatory markers, as well as distribution of WMH were assessed in 1,825 participants of the LIFE‐adult study (age, 20–82 years; BMI, 18.4–55.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) using high‐resolution 3‐Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel‐wise analyses tested if obesity predicts regional probability of WMH. Additionally, mediation effects of high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein and interleukin‐6 (IL6) measured in blood were related to obesity and WMH using linear regression and structural equation models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>WHR related to higher WMH probability predominantly in the deep white matter, even after adjusting for effects of age, sex, and systolic blood pressure (mean ß = 0.0043 [0.0008 SE], 95% confidence interval, [0.00427, 0.0043]; threshold‐free cluster enhancement, family‐wise error‐corrected <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Conversely, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with WMH in periventricular white matter regions. Mediation analyses indicated that both higher WHR and higher BMI contributed to increased deep‐to‐periventricular WMH ratio through elevated IL6.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results indicate an increased WMH burden selectively in the deep white matter in obese subjects with high visceral fat accumulation, independent of common obesity comorbidities such as hypertension. Mediation analyses proposed that visceral obesity contributes to deep white matter lesions through increases in proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a pathomechanistic link. Longitudinal studies need to confirm this hypothesis. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:194–203.</b></p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies are commonly observed among clinically normal older individuals at postmortem and can now be detected with <i>in vivo</i> neuroimaging. The association and interaction of these proteinopathies with prospective cognitive decline in normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be fully elucidated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred thirty‐seven older individuals (age = 76.3 ± 6.22 years) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent Aβ (<sup>11</sup>C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F‐flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with prospective neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of cognitive visits = 2.8 ± 1.1). Tau and Aβ PET measures were assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex‐wise map analyses. Cognitive change was evaluated with Memory and Executive Function composites.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher levels of Aβ and tau were both associated with greater memory decline, but not with change in executive function. Higher cortical Aβ was associated with higher tau levels in all ROIs, independent of age, and very elevated levels of tau were observed primarily in clinically normal with elevated Aβ. A significant interaction between tau and Aβ was observed in both ROI and map‐level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results are consistent with the supposition that both Aβ and tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical stages of AD. These findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging and early cognitive manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary prevention trials in preclinical AD.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is caused by mutations that allow some retained ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Here, we describe the clinical features of the largest established cohort of individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia and explore genotype‐phenotype correlations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross‐sectional data were collected retrospectively. Patients were classified as variant ataxia‐telangiectasia based on retained ATM kinase activity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study includes 57 individuals. Mean age at assessment was 37.5 years. Most had their first symptoms by age 10 (81%). There was a diagnostic delay of more than 10 years in 68% and more than 20 years in one third of probands. Disease severity was mild in one third of patients, and 43% were still ambulant 20 years after disease onset. Only one third had predominant ataxia, and 18% had a pure extrapyramidal presentation. Individuals with extrapyramidal presentations had milder neurological disease severity. There were no significant respiratory or immunological complications, but 25% of individuals had a history of malignancy. Missense mutations were associated with milder neurological disease severity, but with a higher risk of malignancy, compared to leaky splice site mutations.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia require malignancy surveillance and tailored management. However, our data suggest the condition may sometimes be mis‐ or underdiagnosed because of atypical features, including exclusive extrapyramidal symptoms, normal eye movements, and normal alpha‐fetoprotein levels in some individuals. Missense mutations are associated with milder neurological presentations, but a particularly high malignancy risk, and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these phenotypes. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:170–180.</b></p>

<p>Easily accessible biomarkers in Huntington disease (HD) are actively searched. We investigated telomere length and DNA double‐strand breaks (histone variant pγ‐H2AX) as predictive disease biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 premanifest subjects, 58 HD patients with similar CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>), and 44 healthy controls (HC). PBMC from the pre‐HD and HD groups showed shorter telomeres (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and a significant increase of pγ‐H2AX compared to the controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The levels of pγ‐H2AX correlated robustly with the presence of the mutated gene in pre‐HD and HD. The availability of a potentially reversible biomarker (pγ‐H2AX) in the premanifest stage of HD, negligible in HC, provides a novel tool to monitor premanifest subjects and find patient‐specific drugs.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Alexander Shakeel Bates, Jasper Janssens, Gregory SXE Jefferis, Stein Aerts</p><div><p>At around 150 000 neurons, the adult <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> central nervous system is one of the largest species, for which a complete cellular catalogue is imminent. While numerically much simpler than mammalian brains, its complexity is still difficult to parse without grouping neurons into consistent types, which can number 1–1000 cells per hemisphere. We review how neuroanatomical and gene expression data are being used to discover neuronal types at scale. The correlation among multiple co-varying neuronal properties, including lineage, gene expression, morphology, connectivity, response properties and shared behavioral significance is essential to the definition of neuronal cell type. Initial studies comparing morphological and transcriptomic definitions of neuronal type suggest that these are highly consistent, but there is much to do to match these approaches brain-wide. Matched single-cell transcriptomic and morphological data provide an effective reference point to integrate other data types, including connectomics data. This will significantly enhance our ability to make functional predictions from brain wiring diagrams as well facilitating molecular genetic manipulation of neuronal types.</p></div>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44036">Neuroblast-specific chromatin landscapes allows the integration of spatial and temporal cues during Drosophila neurogenesis</a></h4>

Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown. <i>Drosophila</i> progenitors (neuroblasts) are a good model: they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors known. Here we test whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. We used Targeted-DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that make different progeny. Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor binding correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42837">A systematic approach to identify recycling endocytic cargo depending on the GARP complex</a></h4>

Proteins and lipids of the plasma membrane underlie constant remodeling via a combination of the secretory- and the endocytic pathway. In the yeast endocytic pathway, cargo is sorted for recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation in vacuoles. Previously we have shown a role for the GARP complex in sphingolipid sorting and homeostasis (Fröhlich et al. 2015). However, the majority of cargo sorted in a GARP dependent process remain largely unknown. Here we use auxin induced degradation of GARP combined with mass spectrometry based vacuolar proteomics and lipidomics to show that recycling of two specific groups of proteins, the amino-phospholipid flippases and cell wall synthesis proteins depends on a functional GARP complex. Our results suggest that mis-sorting of flippases and remodeling of the lipid composition are the first occurring defects in GARP mutants. Our assay can be adapted to systematically map cargo of the entire endocytic pathway.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41676">Incidences of problematic cell lines are lower in papers that use RRIDs to identify cell lines</a></h4>

The use of misidentified and contaminated cell lines continues to be a problem in biomedical research. Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) should reduce the prevalence of misidentified and contaminated cell lines in the literature by alerting researchers to cell lines that are on the list of problematic cell lines, which is maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) and the Cellosaurus database. To test this assertion, we text-mined the methods sections of about two million papers in PubMed Central, identifying 305,161 unique cell-line names in 150,459 articles. We estimate that 8.6% of these cell lines were on the list of problematic cell lines, whereas only 3.3% of the cell lines in the 634 papers that included RRIDs were on the problematic list. This suggests that the use of RRIDs is associated with a lower reported use of problematic cell lines.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41637">Mi-2/NuRD complex protects stem cell progeny from mitogenic Notch signalling</a></h4>

To progress towards differentiation, progeny of stem cells need to extinguish expression of stem cell maintenance genes. Failures in such mechanisms can drive tumorigenesis. In Drosophila neural stem cell (NSC) lineages, excessive Notch signalling results in supernumerary NSCs causing hyperplasia. However, onset of hyperplasia is considerably delayed implying there are mechanisms that resist the mitogenic signal. Monitoring the live expression of a Notch target gene, <i>E(spl)mγ</i>, revealed that normal attenuation is still initiated in the presence of excess Notch activity so that re-emergence of NSC properties occurs only in older progeny. Screening for factors responsible, we found that depletion of Mi-2/NuRD ATP remodeling complex dramatically enhanced Notch-induced hyperplasia. Under these conditions, <i>E(spl)mγ </i>was no longer extinguished in NSC progeny. We propose that Mi-2 is required for decommissioning stem cell enhancers in their progeny, enabling the switch towards more differentiated fates and rendering them insensitive to mitogenic factors such as Notch.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41540"><i>In Vivo</i> imaging of β-cell function reveals glucose-mediated heterogeneity of β-cell functional development</a></h4>

How pancreatic β-cells acquire function <i>in vivo</i> is a long-standing mystery due to the lack of technology to visualize β-cell function in living animals. Here, we applied a high-resolution two-photon light-sheet microscope for the first <i>in vivo</i> imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of every β-cell in Tg (<i>ins:Rcamp1.07</i>) zebrafish. We reveal that the heterogeneity of β-cell functional development <i>in vivo</i> occurred as two waves propagating from the islet mantle to the core, coordinated by islet vascularization. Increasing amounts of glucose induced functional acquisition and enhancement of β-cells via activating calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signalling. Conserved in mammalians, calcineurin/NFAT prompted high-glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of neonatal mouse islets cultured <i>in vitro</i>. However, the reduction in low-glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was dependent on optimal glucose but independent of calcineurin/NFAT. Thus, combination of optimal glucose and calcineurin activation represents a previously unexplored strategy for promoting functional maturation of stem cell-derived β-like cells <i>in vitro</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41351">Mitochondrial fusion supports increased oxidative phosphorylation during cell proliferation</a></h4>

Proliferating cells often have increased glucose consumption and lactate excretion relative to the same cells in the quiescent state, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Despite an increase in glycolysis, however, here we show that non-transformed mouse fibroblasts also increase oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by nearly two-fold and mitochondrial coupling efficiency by ~30% during proliferation. Both increases are supported by mitochondrial fusion. Impairing mitochondrial fusion by knocking down mitofusion-2 (Mfn2) was sufficient to attenuate proliferation, while overexpressing Mfn2 increased proliferation. Interestingly, impairing mitochondrial fusion decreased OXPHOS but did not deplete ATP levels. Instead, inhibition caused cells to transition from excreting aspartate to consuming it. Transforming fibroblasts with the <i>Ras</i> oncogene induced mitochondrial biogenesis, which further elevated OXPHOS. Notably, transformed fibroblasts continued to have elongated mitochondria and their proliferation remained sensitive to inhibition of Mfn2. Our results suggest that cell proliferation requires increased OXPHOS as supported by mitochondrial fusion.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40970">Long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life</a></h4>

Leptin regulates energy balance and also exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, the present study restored leptin signaling either at the 4<sup>th</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene. We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic <i>Pomc</i>, <i>Cartpt</i> and <i>Prlh</i> mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental problems.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39123">Potentiation of P2RX7 as a host-directed strategy for control of mycobacterial infection</a></h4>

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is the leading worldwide cause of death due to a single infectious agent. Existing anti-tuberculous therapies require long treatments and are complicated by multi-drug-resistant strains. Host-directed therapies have been proposed as an orthogonal approach, but few have moved into clinical trials. Here, we use the zebrafish-<i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> infection model as a whole-animal screening platform to identify FDA-approved, host-directed compounds. We identify multiple compounds that modulate host immunity to limit mycobacterial disease, including the inexpensive, safe, and widely used drug clemastine. We find that clemastine alters macrophage calcium transients through potentiation of the purinergic receptor P2RX7. Host-directed drug activity in zebrafish larvae depends on both P2RX7 and inflammasome signaling. Thus, targeted activation of a P2RX7 axis provides a novel strategy for enhanced control of mycobacterial infections. Using a novel explant model, we find that clemastine is also effective within the complex granulomas that are the hallmark of mycobacterial infection.

Direction-selective retinal ganglion cells encode visual motion but also respond to luminance changes. Kühn and Gollisch report that this dual-feature sensitivity creates ambiguities for decoding complex motion stimuli. Population decoding resolves these ambiguities and provides a synergistic motion readout.

<p>by Margot C. Bjoring, C. Daniel Meliza</p>

Birdsong is a complex vocal communication signal, and like humans, birds need to discriminate between similar sequences of sound with different meanings. The caudal mesopallium (CM) is a cortical-level auditory area implicated in song discrimination. CM neurons respond sparsely to conspecific song and are tolerant of production variability. Intracellular recordings in CM have identified a diversity of intrinsic membrane dynamics, which could contribute to the emergence of these higher-order functional properties. We investigated this hypothesis using a novel linear-dynamical cascade model that incorporated detailed biophysical dynamics to simulate auditory responses to birdsong. Neuron models that included a low-threshold potassium current present in a subset of CM neurons showed increased selectivity and coding efficiency relative to models without this current. These results demonstrate the impact of intrinsic dynamics on sensory coding and the importance of including the biophysical characteristics of neural populations in simulation studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JCcLbdK_z5k" width="1" />

Genome data, with underlying new knowledge, are accumulating at exponential rate thanks to ever-improving sequencing technologies and the parallel development of dedicated efficient Bioinformatics methods and tools. Advanced Education in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses is to a large extent not accessible to students in developing countries where endeavors to set up Bioinformatics courses concern most often only basic levels. Here, we report a pioneering pilot experience concerning the design and implementation, from scratch, of a three-months advanced and extensive course in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses in the Institut Pasteur de Tunis. Most significantly the outcome of the course was upgrading the participants’ skills in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses to recognized international standards. Here we detail the different steps involved in the implementation of this course as well as the topics covered in the program. The description of this pilot experience might be helpful for the implementation of other similar educational projects, notably in developing countries, aiming to go beyond basics and providing young researchers with high-level skills.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jk3OXkDl4KM" width="1" />

<p>by Timothy D. Majarian, Robert F. Murphy, Seema S. Lakdawala</p>

Within influenza virus infected cells, viral genomic RNA are selectively packed into progeny virions, which predominantly contain a single copy of 8 viral RNA segments. Intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions are thought to mediate selective packaging of each viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Clear evidence of a specific interaction network culminating in the full genomic set has yet to be identified. Using multi-color fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization to visualize four vRNP segments within a single cell, we developed image-based models of vRNP-vRNP spatial dependence. These models were used to construct likely sequences of vRNP associations resulting in the full genomic set. Our results support the notion that selective packaging occurs during cytoplasmic transport and identifies the formation of multiple distinct vRNP sub-complexes that likely form as intermediate steps toward full genomic inclusion into a progeny virion. The methods employed demonstrate a statistically driven, model based approach applicable to other interaction and assembly problems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/99ZwYvNlJkU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The inter-regional connectivity of sensory structures in the brain allows for the modulation of sensory processing in manners important for perception. In the olfactory system, odor representations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are modulated by feedback centrifugal innervation from several olfactory cortices, including the piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nucleus. Previous studies reported that an additional olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, also centrifugally innervates the OB and may even shape the activity of OB output neurons. In an attempt to identify the cell-types of this centrifugal innervation, we performed retrograde tracing experiments in mice utilizing three unique strategies, including retrobeads, retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving a fluorescent reporter, and retrograde AAV driving Cre-expression in the Ai9 floxed transgenic reporter line. Our results replicated the standing literature and uncovered robustly labeled neurons in the ipsilateral piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and numerous other structures known to innervate the OB. Surprisingly, consistent throughout all of our approaches, no labeled soma were observed in the olfactory tubercle. These findings indicate that the olfactory tubercle is unique among other olfactory cortices in that it does not innervate the OB, which refines our understanding of the centrifugal modulation of the OB.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The perception of our environment relies upon the distribution of sensory information throughout brain regions. This is true in the olfactory system wherein projections between olfactory centers, including feedback centrifugal input to the olfactory bulb, provide the basis for olfactory perception. Here, we show that one olfactory cortical structure, the olfactory tubercle, is unique among olfactory cortices in that it lacks feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. This ‘negative result’ is important in that it refines current models for the circuitry of our olfactory system and challenges previous literature reporting such a pathway in fact exists.</p>

Abstract<p>Stress causes divergent patterns of structural and physiological plasticity in the hippocampus versus amygdala. However, a majority of earlier studies focused primarily on neurons. Despite growing evidence for the importance of glia in health and disease, relatively little is known about how stress affects astrocytes. Further, previous work focused on hippocampal astrocytes. Hence, we examined the impact of chronic immobilization stress (2 h/day, 10 days), on the number and structure of astrocytes in the rat hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a reduction in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala (BA), a day after the end of 10 days of chronic stress. Detailed morphometric analysis of individual dye-filled astrocytes also revealed a decrease in the neuropil volume occupied by these astrocytes in the BA, alongside a reduction in the volume fraction of fine astrocytic protrusions rather than larger dendrite-like processes. By contrast, the same chronic stress had no effect on the number or morphology of astrocytes in hippocampal area CA3. We also confirmed previous reports that chronic stress triggers dendritic hypertrophy in dye-filled BA principal neurons that were located adjacent to astrocytes that had undergone atrophy. Thus, building on earlier evidence for contrasting patterns of stress-induced plasticity in neurons across brain areas, our findings offer new evidence that the same stress can also elicit divergent morphological effects in astrocytes in the hippocampus versus the amygdala.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Despite accumulating evidence on the role of astrocytes in health and disease, relatively little is known about the effects of stress on these cells. We report here, for the first time, that the divergent effects of chronic immobilization stress on the morphological properties of neurons in hippocampus and amygdala also extend to astrocytes in the rat brain. Chronic stress reduces the number of astrocytes in the amygdala, without affecting them in the hippocampus. Strikingly, the same stress elicits divergent morphological effects – neuronal hypertrophy versus atrophy of astrocytes – in the amygdala. These findings underscore the need to further examine non-cell autonomous, astroglial mediated effects elicited by stress, and how these vary across brain regions.</p>

Abstract<p>Cognitive decline with aging is often due to altered levels of protein expression. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) and the complex of proteins surrounding the receptor are susceptible to age-related changes in expression. In the frontal cortex of aged mice, there is significant loss of expression of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAr, an increase in Fyn expression, and no change in PSD-95. Studies have also found that, in the frontal cortex, phosphorylation of GluN2B subunits and palmitoylation of GluN2 subunits and NMDAr complex proteins are affected by age. In this study, we examined some of the factors that may lead to the differences in the palmitoylation levels of NMDAr complex proteins in the frontal cortex of aged animals. The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning in 3 and 24-month-old mice. The acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE) method was used to precipitate palmitoylated proteins from the frontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. Additionally, brain lysates from old and young mice were probed for expression of fatty acid transporter proteins.</p><p>An age-related increase of palmitoylated GluN2A, GluN2B, Fyn, PSD-95, and APT1 in the frontal cortex was associated with poorer reference memory and/or executive functions. These data suggest that there may be a perturbation in the palmitoylation cycle in the frontal cortex of aged mice that contributes to age-related cognitive declines.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Cognitive decline due to aging significantly impacts the quality of life of those affected, as well as their families. Although data has shown that there isn’t a dramatic loss of neurons in the aged brain, the expression of some proteins essential for memory dwindle with advanced age. However, other proteins remain constant or increase with age. Posttranslational modification of proteins via palmitoylation significantly alters the function of signaling molecules in the brain. We found an age-related increase in the percentage of NMDA receptor-associated proteins that were palmitoylated in the frontal cortex of mice, which were associated with age-related deficits in memory and executive functions. This finding may point to a previously unexplored mechanism of cognitive decline in older individuals.</p>

<p>Modern neuroscience is currently limited in its capacity to perform long
term, wide-field measurements of neuron electromagnetics with nanoscale
resolution. Quantum microscopy using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NV) can
provide a potential solution to this problem with electric and magnetic field
sensing at nano-scale resolution and good biocompatibility. However, the
performance of existing NV sensing technology does not allow for studies of
small mammalian neurons yet. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by engineering NV quantum sensors in diamond nanopillar arrays. The
pillars improve light collection efficiency by guiding excitation/emission
light, which improves sensitivity. More importantly, they also improve the size
of the signal at the NV by removing screening charges as well as coordinating
the neuron growth to the tips of the pillars where the NV is located. Here, we
provide a growth study to demonstrate coordinated neuron growth as well as the
first simulation of nano-scopic neuron electric and magnetic fields to assess
the enhancement provided by the nanopillar geometry.

<p>Ablation studies have been widely used in the field of neuroscience to tackle
complex biological systems such as the extensively studied Drosophila central
nervous system, the vertebrate brain and more interestingly and most
delicately, the human brain. In the past, these kinds of studies were utilized
to uncover structure and organization in the brain, i.e. a mapping of features
inherent to external stimuli onto different areas of the neocortex. considering
the growth in size and complexity of state-of-the-art artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and the corresponding growth in complexity of the tasks that
are tackled by these networks, the question arises whether ablation studies may
be used to investigate these networks for a similar organization of their inner
representations. In this paper, we address this question and performed two
ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate their inner
representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer vision
domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure of
the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network.
Furthermore, some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network
a certain robustness to structural damages. We further determined the
importance of specific parts of the network for the classification task solely
based on the weight structure of single units. Finally, we examined the ability
of damaged networks to recover from the consequences of ablations by means of
recovery training. We argue that ablations studies are a feasible method to
investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and are especially helpful to
examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a feature of ANNs that
will become increasingly important for future safety-critical applications.

<p>Extended Kalman filter (EKF) does not guarantee consistent mean and
covariance under linearization, even though it is the main framework for
robotic localization. While Lie group improves the modeling of the state space
in localization, the EKF on Lie group still relies on the arbitrary Gaussian
assumption in face of nonlinear models. We instead use von Mises filter for
orientation estimation together with the conventional Kalman filter for
position estimation, and thus we are able to characterize the first two moments
of the state estimates. Since the proposed algorithm holds a solid
probabilistic basis, it is fundamentally relieved from the inconsistency
problem. Furthermore, we extend the localization algorithm to fully circular
representation even for position, which is similar to grid patterns found in
mammalian brains and in recurrent neural networks. The applicability of the
proposed algorithms is substantiated not only by strong mathematical foundation
but also by the comparison against other common localization methods.

<p>by Joseph D. Monaco, Rose M. De Guzman, Hugh T. Blair, Kechen Zhang</p>

During spatial navigation, the frequency and timing of spikes from spatial neurons including place cells in hippocampus and grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are temporally organized by continuous theta oscillations (6–11 Hz). The theta rhythm is regulated by subcortical structures including the medial septum, but it is unclear how spatial information from place cells may reciprocally organize subcortical theta-rhythmic activity. Here we recorded single-unit spiking from a constellation of subcortical and hippocampal sites to study spatial modulation of rhythmic spike timing in rats freely exploring an open environment. Our analysis revealed a novel class of neurons that we termed ‘phaser cells,’ characterized by a symmetric coupling between firing rate and spike theta-phase. Phaser cells encoded space by assigning distinct phases to allocentric isocontour levels of each cell’s spatial firing pattern. In our dataset, phaser cells were predominantly located in the lateral septum, but also the hippocampus, anteroventral thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Unlike the unidirectional late-to-early phase precession of place cells, bidirectional phase modulation acted to return phaser cells to the same theta-phase along a given spatial isocontour, including cells that characteristically shifted to later phases at higher firing rates. Our dynamical models of intrinsic theta-bursting neurons demonstrated that experience-independent temporal coding mechanisms can qualitatively explain (1) the spatial rate-phase relationships of phaser cells and (2) the observed temporal segregation of phaser cells according to phase-shift direction. In open-field phaser cell simulations, competitive learning embedded phase-code entrainment maps into the weights of downstream targets, including path integration networks. Bayesian phase decoding revealed error correction capable of resetting path integration at subsecond timescales. Our findings suggest that phaser cells may instantiate a subcortical theta-rhythmic loop of spatial feedback. We outline a framework in which location-dependent synchrony reconciles internal idiothetic processes with the allothetic reference points of sensory experience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zGh30KsIyYw" width="1" />

<p>Using a novel network analysis of spontaneous low-frequency functional MRI
data recorded at rest, we study the functional network that describes the
extent of synchronization among different areas of the brain. Comparing
forty-four medicated patients and forty healthy subjects, we detected
significant differences in the robustness of these functional networks. Such
differences resulted in a larger resistance to edge removal (disconnection) in
the graph of schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy controls. This paper
shows that the distribution of connectivity strength among brain regions is
spatially more homogeneous in schizophrenic patients with respect to healthy
ones. As a consequence, the precise hierarchical modularity of healthy brains
is crumbled in schizophrenic ones, making possible a peculiar arrangement of
region-to-region interaction that, in turns, produces several topologically
equivalent backbones of the whole functional brain network. We hypothesize that
the manifold nature of the basal scheme of functional organization within the
brain, together with its altered hierarchical modularity, contributes to
positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our work also fits the disconnection
hypothesis that describes schizophrenia as a brain disorder, characterized by
abnormal functional integration among brain regions.

<p>The cortex exhibits self-sustained highly-irregular activity even under
resting conditions, whose origin and function need to be fully understood. It
is believed that this can be described as an "asynchronous state" stemming from
the balance between excitation and inhibition, with important consequences for
information-processing, though a competing hypothesis claims it stems from
critical dynamics. By analyzing a parsimonious neural-network model with
excitatory and inhibitory interactions, we elucidate a noise-induced mechanism
called "Jensen's force" responsible for the emergence of a novel phase of
arbitrarily-low but self-sustained activity, which reproduces all the
experimental features of asynchronous states. The simplicity of our framework
allows for a deep understanding of asynchronous states from a broad
statistical-mechanics perspective and of the phase transitions to other
standard phases it exhibits, opening the door to reconcile, asynchronous-state
and critical-state hypotheses. We argue that Jensen's forces are measurable
experimentally and might be relevant in contexts beyond neuroscience.

<p>Most of mathematic forgetting curve models fit well with the forgetting data
under the learning condition of one time rather than repeated. In the paper, a
convolution model of forgetting curve is proposed to simulate the memory
process during learning. In this model, the memory ability (i.e. the central
procedure in the working memory model) and learning material (i.e. the input in
the working memory model) is regarded as the system function and the input
function, respectively. The status of forgetting (i.e. the output in the
working memory model) is regarded as output function or the convolution result
of the memory ability and learning material. The model is applied to simulate
the forgetting curves in different situations. The results show that the model
is able to simulate the forgetting curves not only in one time learning
condition but also in multi-times condition. The model is further verified in
the experiments of Mandarin tone learning for Japanese learners. And the
predicted curve fits well on the test points.

<p>Multimodal behavior involves multiple processing stations distributed across
distant brain regions, but our understanding of how such distributed processing
is coordinated in the brain is limited. Here we take a decoding approach to
this problem, aiming to quantify how temporal aspects of brain-wide neural
activity may be used to infer specific multimodal behaviors. Using high
temporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from
hundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond
resolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural
activity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time
differences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is
particularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of
magnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for
this regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature
selection. Surprisingly, we find that decoding using time-differences, based on
thousands of region pairs, is significantly more accurate than using other
activity characteristics, reaching 90% accuracy consistently across subjects.
These results suggest that relevant information about multimodal brain function
is provided by subtle time differences across remote brain areas.

Phototrophic organisms such as cyanobacteria utilize the sun’s energy to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon, resulting in diurnal variations in the cell’s metabolism. Flux balance analysis is a widely accepted constraint-based optimization tool for analyzing growth and metabolism, but it is generally used in a time-invariant manner with no provisions for sequestering different biomass components at different time periods. Here we present CycleSyn, a periodic model of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 metabolism that spans a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle by segmenting it into 12 Time Point Models (TPMs) with a uniform duration of two hours. The developed framework allows for the flow of metabolites across TPMs while inventorying metabolite levels and only allowing for the utilization of currently or previously produced compounds. The 12 TPMs allow for the incorporation of time-dependent constraints that capture the cyclic nature of cellular processes. Imposing bounds on reactions informed by temporally-segmented transcriptomic data enables simulation of phototrophic growth as a single linear programming (LP) problem. The solution provides the time varying reaction fluxes over a 24-hour cycle and the accumulation/consumption of metabolites. The diurnal rhythm of metabolic gene expression driven by the circadian clock and its metabolic consequences is explored. Predicted flux and metabolite pools are in line with published studies regarding the temporal organization of phototrophic growth in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 paving the way for constructing time-resolved genome-scale models (GSMs) for organisms with a circadian clock. In addition, the metabolic reorganization that would be required to enable <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 to temporally separate photosynthesis from oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation is also explored using the developed model formalism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TnrMxUFOeR0" width="1" />

The differential modulation of agonist and antagonist binding to opioid receptors (ORs) by sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) has been known for decades. To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na<sup>+</sup> translocation through the μ-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na<sup>+</sup> binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na<sup>+</sup> translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vAvW0Pod-dQ" width="1" />

Cellular functions are shaped by reaction networks whose dynamics are determined by the concentrations of underlying components. However, cellular mechanisms ensuring that a component’s concentration resides in a given range remain elusive. We present network properties which suffice to identify components whose concentration ranges can be efficiently computed in mass-action metabolic networks. We show that the derived ranges are in excellent agreement with simulations from a detailed kinetic metabolic model of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We demonstrate that the approach can be used with genome-scale metabolic models to arrive at predictions concordant with measurements from <i>Escherichia coli</i> under different growth scenarios. By application to 14 genome-scale metabolic models from diverse species, our approach specifies the cellular determinants of concentration ranges that can be effectively employed to make predictions for a variety of biotechnological and medical applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kQAXSW7n2UI" width="1" />

<p>by David Hodgson, Andrew D. Rowan, Francesco Falciani, Carole J. Proctor</p>

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition caused by dysregulation of multiple molecular signalling pathways. Such dysregulation results in damage to cartilage, a smooth and protective tissue that enables low friction articulation of synovial joints. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-13, are key enzymes in the cleavage of type II collagen which is a vital component for cartilage integrity. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) can protect against pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated MMP expression. With age there is a change in the ratio of two TGFβ type I receptors (Alk1/Alk5), a shift that results in TGFβ losing its protective role in cartilage homeostasis. Instead, TGFβ promotes cartilage degradation which correlates with the spontaneous development of OA in murine models. However, the mechanism by which TGFβ protects against pro-inflammatory responses and how this changes with age has not been extensively studied. As TGFβ signalling is complex, we used systems biology to combine experimental and computational outputs to examine how the system changes with age. Experiments showed that the repressive effect of TGFβ on chondrocytes treated with a pro-inflammatory stimulus required Alk5. Computational modelling revealed two independent mechanisms were needed to explain the crosstalk between TGFβ and pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. A novel meta-analysis of microarray data from OA patient tissue was used to create a Cytoscape network representative of human OA and revealed the importance of inflammation. Combining the modelled genes with the microarray network provided a global overview into the crosstalk between the different signalling pathways involved in OA development.
Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms that cause TGFβ signalling to change from a protective to a detrimental pathway in cartilage with ageing. Moreover, such a systems biology approach may enable restoration of the protective role of TGFβ as a potential therapy to prevent age-related loss of cartilage and the development of OA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/djeTM0j7Dos" width="1" />

<p>by Dayanne M. Castro, Nicholas R. de Veaux, Emily R. Miraldi, Richard Bonneau</p>

Gene regulatory networks are composed of sub-networks that are often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sm0qtCLgIJQ" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher J. Lortie</p>

Statistical books can provide deep insights into statistics and software. There are, however, many resources available to the practitioner. Book reviews have the capacity to function as a critical mechanism for the learner to assess the merits of engaging in part, in full, or at all with a book. The “ten simple rules” format, pioneered in computational biology, was applied here to writing effective book reviews for statistics because of the wide breadth of offerings in this domain, including topical introductions, computational solutions, and theory. Learning by doing is a popular paradigm in statistics and computation, but there is still a niche for books in the pedagogy of self-taught and instruction-based learning. Primarily, these rules ensure that book reviews function as a form of short syntheses to inform and guide readers in deciding to use a specific book relative to other options for resolving statistical challenges.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u6I3i7zGdDw" width="1" />

<p>The free energy principle has been proposed as a unifying theory of brain
function. It is closely related, and in some cases subsumes, earlier unifying
ideas such as Bayesian inference, predictive coding, and active learning. This
article clarifies these connections, teasing apart distinctive and shared

<p>Finding the causes to observed effects and establishing causal relationships
between events is (and has been) an essential element of science and
philosophy. Automated methods that can detect causal relationships would be
very welcome, but practical methods that can infer causality are difficult to
find, and the subject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only
detects correlation, there are several information-theoretic notions of
"directed information" that have successfully detected causality in some
systems, in particular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has
shown that some directed information measures can sometimes inadequately
estimate the extent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing
cause-effect relations between components of systems, especially if neurons
contribute in a cryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we
test how often cryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that
generates artificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks:
motion detection and sound localization. Our results suggest that whether or
not transfer entropy measures of causality are misleading depends strongly on
the cognitive task considered. These results emphasize the importance of
understanding the fundamental logic processes that contribute to cognitive
processing, and quantifying their relevance in any given nervous system.

<p>The human brain is composed of distinct regions that are each associated with
particular functions and distinct propensities for the control of neural
dynamics. However, the relation between these functions and control profiles is
poorly understood, as is the variation in this relation across diverse scales
of space and time. Here we probe the relation between control and dynamics in
brain networks constructed from diffusion tensor imaging data in a large
community based sample of young adults. Specifically, we probe the control
properties of each brain region and investigate their relationship with
dynamics across various spatial scales using the Laplacian eigenspectrum. In
addition, through analysis of regional modal controllability and partitioning
of modes, we determine whether the associated dynamics are fast or slow, as
well as whether they are alternating or monotone. We find that brain regions
that facilitate the control of energetically easy transitions are associated
with activity on short length scales and fast time scales. Conversely, brain
regions that facilitate control of difficult transitions are associated with
activity on long length scales and slow time scales. Built on linear dynamical
models, our results offer parsimonious explanations for the activity
propagation and network control profiles supported by regions of differing
neuroanatomical structure.

Conflicting reports about whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in humans raise questions about its significance for human health and the relevance of animal models. Drawing upon published data, I review species’ neurogenesis rates across the lifespan and propose that accelerated neurodevelopmental timing is consistent with lower rates of neurogenesis in adult primates and humans. Nonetheless, protracted neurogenesis may produce populations of neurons that retain plastic properties for long intervals, and have distinct functions depending on when in the lifespan they were born.

<p>by Carmen Lía Murall, Robert Jackson, Ingeborg Zehbe, Nathalie Boulle, Michel Segondy, Samuel Alizon</p>

Infections of stratified epithelia contribute to a large group of common diseases, such as dermatological conditions and sexually transmitted diseases. To investigate how epithelial structure affects infection dynamics, we develop a general ecology-inspired model for stratified epithelia. Our model allows us to simulate infections, explore new hypotheses and estimate parameters that are difficult to measure with tissue cell cultures. We focus on two contrasting pathogens: <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> and Human papillomaviruses. Using cervicovaginal parameter estimates, we find that key infection symptoms can be explained by differential interactions with the layers, while clearance and pathogen burden appear to be bottom-up processes. Cell protective responses to infections (e.g. mucus trapping) generally lowered pathogen load but there were specific effects based on infection strategies. Our modeling approach opens new perspectives for 3D tissue culture experimental systems of infections and, more generally, for developing and testing hypotheses related to infections of stratified epithelia.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ztnxRVtKRWQ" width="1" />

<p>Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2<sup>–/–</sup> slices are protected from amyloid-β-oligomer (Aβo)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Aβo-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1E9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Aβ accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Aβo signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Aβ oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Aβ-triggered dysfunction.</p>

<p>Recent evidence suggests that blood–brain barrier (BBB) recovery and reestablishment of BBB impermeability after stroke is incomplete. This could influence stroke recovery, increase the risk of repeat stroke, and be a solid substrate for developing vascular dementia. Although accumulating evidence has defined morphological alterations and underlying mechanisms of tight junction (TJ) changes during BBB breakdown in acute stroke, very little is known about the type of alterations and mechanisms in BBB "leakage" found subacutely or chronically. The current study examined BBB structural alterations during the "BBB leakage" associated with the chronic phase of stroke in male mice and both genders of humans. We found significant upregulation of claudin-1 mRNA and protein, a nonspecific claudin for blood vessels, and downregulation in claudin-5 expression. Morphological and biochemical as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of postischemic brain endothelial cells and cells overexpressing claudin-1 indicated that newly synthesized claudin-1 was present on the cell membrane (~45%), was incorporated into the TJ complex with established interaction with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and was building homophilic <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-interactions. The appearance of claudin-1 in the TJ complex reduced claudin-5 strands (homophilic claudin-5 <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-interactions) and claudin-5/ZO-1 interaction affecting claudin-5 incorporation into the TJ complex. Moreover, claudin-1 induction was associated with an endothelial proinflammatory phenotype. Targeting claudin-1 with a specific C1C2 peptide improved brain endothelial barrier permeability and functional recovery in chronic stroke condition. This study highlights a potential "defect" in postischemic barrier formation that may underlie prolonged vessel leakiness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although rarely expressed at the normal blood–brain barrier (BBB), claudin-1 is expressed in pathological conditions. Analyzing poststroke human and mouse blood microvessels we have identified that claudin-1 is highly expressed in leaky brain microvessels. Our results reveal that claudin-1 is incorporated in BBB tight junction complex, impeding BBB recovery and causing BBB leakiness during poststroke recovery. Targeting claudin-1 with a claudin-1 peptide improves brain endothelial barrier permeability and consequently functional neurological recovery after stroke.</p>

<p>Astrocyte expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is consistently observed in resected tissue from patients with epilepsy and is equally prevalent in animal models of epilepsy. However, little is known about the functional signaling properties or downstream consequences of astrocyte mGluR5 activation during epilepsy development. In the rodent brain, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is developmentally regulated and confined in expression/function to the first weeks of life, with similar observations made in human control tissue. Herein, we demonstrate that mGluR5 expression and function dramatically increase in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Interestingly, in both male and female mice, mGluR5 function persists in the astrocyte throughout the process of epileptogenesis following status epilepticus. However, mGluR5 expression and function are transient in animals that do not develop epilepsy over an equivalent time period, suggesting that patterns of mGluR5 expression may signify continuing epilepsy development or its resolution. We demonstrate that, during epileptogenesis, astrocytes reacquire mGluR5-dependent calcium transients following agonist application or synaptic glutamate release, a feature of astrocyte-neuron communication absent since early development. Finally, we find that the selective and conditional knock-out of mGluR5 signaling from astrocytes during epilepsy development slows the rate of glutamate clearance through astrocyte glutamate transporters under high-frequency stimulation conditions, a feature that suggests astrocyte mGluR5 expression during epileptogenesis may recapitulate earlier developmental roles in regulating glutamate transporter function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In development, astrocyte mGluR5 signaling plays a critical role in regulating structural and functional interactions between astrocytes and neurons at the tripartite synapse. Notably, mGluR5 signaling is a positive regulator of astrocyte glutamate transporter expression and function, an essential component of excitatory signaling regulation in hippocampus. After early development, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is downregulated, but reemerges in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) development and patient epilepsy samples. We explored the hypothesis that astrocyte mGluR5 reemergence recapitulates earlier developmental roles during TLE acquisition. Our work demonstrates that astrocytes with mGluR5 signaling during TLE development perform faster glutamate uptake in hippocampus, revealing a previously unexplored role for astrocyte mGluR5 signaling in hypersynchronous pathology.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/718?rss=1">Hard Decisions Shape the Neural Coding of Preferences</a></h4>

<p>Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study with male and female human participants found that preferences are already updated online during the process of decision-making. Preference changes were predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus while making hard decisions. Fixation durations during this phase predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviorally relevant only for choices that were remembered and were in turn associated with hippocampus activity. Our results suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most theories of decision-making assume that we always choose the best option available, based on a set of stable preferences. However, what happens for hard decisions when the available options are preferred equally? We show that in such stalemate situations, decision-makers adjust their preferences dynamically during the process of decision-making, and these preference adjustments are predicted by a left prefrontal-parietal network. We also show that eye movements during decision-making are predictive of the magnitude of the upcoming value change. Our results suggest that preferences are dynamic, adjusted every time a hard decision is made, prompting a re-evaluation of existing frameworks of decision-making.</p>

<p>We introduce Arbor, a performance portable library for simulation of large
networks of multi-compartment neurons on HPC systems. Arbor is open source
software, developed under the auspices of the HBP. The performance portability
is by virtue of back-end specific optimizations for x86 multicore, Intel KNL,
and NVIDIA GPUs. When coupled with low memory overheads, these optimizations
make Arbor an order of magnitude faster than the most widely-used comparable
simulation software. The single-node performance can be scaled out to run very
large models at extreme scale with efficient weak scaling.

<p>Many time-series data including text, movies, and biological signals can be
represented as sequences of correlated binary patterns. These patterns may be
described by weighted combinations of a few dominant structures that underpin
specific interactions among the binary elements. To extract the dominant
correlation structures and their contributions to generating data in a
time-dependent manner, we model the dynamics of binary patterns using the
state-space model of an Ising-type network that is composed of multiple
undirected graphs. We provide a sequential Bayes algorithm to estimate the
dynamics of weights on the graphs while gaining the graph structures online.
This model can uncover overlapping graphs underlying the data better than a
traditional orthogonal decomposition method, and outperforms an original
time-dependent full Ising model. We assess the performance of the method by
simulated data, and demonstrate that spontaneous activity of cultured
hippocampal neurons is represented by dynamics of multiple graphs.

Tan et al. reveal a key mechanism that underlies signaling from endothelial cells to neurons in the brain. They identify that the endothelium-secreted protein semaphorin 3G (Sema3G) regulates synaptic structure and plasticity in hippocampal neurons through its neuronal neuropilin-2/PlexinA4 holoreceptor.

Microglia provide immune surveillance of the CNS. They display diverse behaviors, including nondirectional and directed motility of their processes, phagocytosis of targets such as dying neurons or superfluous synapses, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Many of these functions are mediated by ion channels and cell surface receptors, the expression of which varies with the many morphological and functional states that microglial cells can adopt. Recent progress in understanding microglial function has been facilitated by applying classical cell physiological techniques in situ, such as patch-clamping and live imaging, and cell-specific transcriptomic analyses.

The combinatorial olfactory code conveys odor stimulus features in an entangled manner. Si et al. uncover structure and statistical properties in ORN responses that allow separated representations of odor features and shine light on the mechanism of molecular recognition by olfactory receptors.

Humans often need to maintain equilibrium between competing goals. Juechems et al. show that a region in the rostral ACC monitors this equilibrium, whereas the vmPFC encodes the redress in imbalance between goals incurred by choice.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (<span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span>) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression, but rather to expression of <span style="font-style: italic;">SLC12A5</span>, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of <span style="font-style: italic;">SLC12A5</span> with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependency of neurophysiological activity between 2 separate brain areas. To investigate the biological characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)—and in particular the significance of connection-wise variation in time-series correlations—rsFC was compared with strychnine-based connectivity measured in the macaque. Strychnine neuronography is a historical technique that induces activity in cortical areas through means of local administration of the substance strychnine. Strychnine causes local disinhibition through GABA suppression and leads to subsequent activation of functional pathways. Multiple resting-state fMRI recordings were acquired in 4 macaques (examining in total 299 imaging runs) from which a group-averaged rsFC matrix was constructed. rsFC was observed to be higher (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) between region-pairs with a strychnine-based connection as compared with region-pairs with no strychnine-based connection present. In particular, higher resting-state connectivity was observed in connections that were relatively stronger (weak &lt; moderate &lt; strong; <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.01) and in connections that were bidirectional (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) instead of unidirectional in strychnine-based connectivity. Our results imply that the level of correlation between brain areas as extracted from resting-state fMRI relates to the strength of underlying interregional functional pathways.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The spontaneous activity of the brain is characterized by an elaborate temporal structure with scale-free properties as indexed by the power law exponent (PLE). We test the hypothesis that spontaneous brain activity modulates task-evoked activity during interactions with animate versus inanimate stimuli. For this purpose, we developed a paradigm requiring participants to actively touch either animate (real hand) or inanimate (mannequin hand) stimuli. Behaviorally, participants perceived the animate target as closer in space, temporally more synchronous with their own self, and more personally relevant, compared with the inanimate. Neuronally, we observed a modulation of task-evoked activity by animate versus inanimate interactions in posterior insula, in medial prefrontal cortex, comprising anterior cingulate cortex, and in medial superior frontal gyrus. Among these regions, an increased functional connectivity was shown between posterior insula and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) during animate compared with inanimate interactions and during resting state. Importantly, PLE during spontaneous brain activity in PACC correlated positively with PACC task-evoked activity during animate versus inanimate stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrate that brain spontaneous activity in PACC can be related to the distinction between animate and inanimate stimuli and thus might be specifically tuned to align our brain with its animate environment.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Manual interactions with objects require precise and rapid feedback about contact events. These tactile signals are integrated with motor plans throughout the neuraxis to achieve dexterous object manipulation. To better understand the role of somatosensory cortex in interactions with objects, we measured, using chronically implanted arrays of electrodes, the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons to skin indentations designed to simulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of contact with an object. First, we find that the responses of somatosensory neurons to contact onset and offset dwarf their responses to maintenance of contact. Second, we show that these responses rapidly and reliably encode features of the simulated contact events—their timing, location, and strength—and can account for the animals’ performance in an amplitude discrimination task. Third, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response in cortex mirror those of the population response in the nerves. We conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons are well suited to encode contact transients and are consistent with a role of somatosensory cortex in signaling transitions between task subgoals.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The current model, based on rodent data, proposes that thalamocortical afferents (TCA) innervate the subplate towards the end of cortical neurogenesis. This implies that the laminar identity of cortical neurons is specified by intrinsic instructions rather than information of thalamic origin. In order to determine whether this mechanism is conserved in the primates, we examined the growth of thalamocortical (TCA) and corticofugal afferents in early human and monkey fetal development. In the human, TCA, identified by secretagogin, calbindin, and ROBO1 immunoreactivity, were observed in the internal capsule of the ventral telencephalon as early as 7–7.5 PCW, crossing the pallial/subpallial boundary (PSB) by 8 PCW before the calretinin immunoreactive corticofugal fibers do. Furthermore, TCA were observed to be passing through the intermediate zone and innervating the presubplate of the dorsolateral cortex, and already by 10–12 PCW TCAs were occupying much of the cortex. Observations at equivalent stages in the marmoset confirmed that this pattern is conserved across primates. Therefore, our results demonstrate that in primates, TCAs innervate the cortical presubplate at earlier stages than previously demonstrated by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, suggesting that pioneer thalamic afferents may contribute to early cortical circuitry that can participate in defining cortical neuron phenotypes.</span>

In nonlinear systems, converging oscillatory inputs undergo frequency mixing, resulting in additional oscillations in the system’s response. Neural recordings exhibit spectral properties predicted by this process suggesting that not all oscillations originate from synaptic inputs rhythmically active at corresponding frequencies.

This study tests the E-I ratio hypothesis of autism in four mouse models. All show increased E-I ratio, but E-I changes are precisely coordinated to stabilize synaptic depolarization and spiking, not increase them. E-I changes therefore appear compensatory in autism.

Genetic mutant analysis in the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> has revealed common molecular programs that control neuronal identity. Neuron type-specific combinations of transcription factors, called terminal selectors, act as master regulatory factors to initiate and maintain terminal identity programs through direct regulation of neuron type-specific effector genes. We will provide here an update on recent studies that solidify the terminal selector concept in worms, flies and chordates. We will also describe how the terminal selector concept has been expanded by recent work in <em>C. elegans</em> to explain neuronal subtype diversification and plasticity of neuronal identity.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Andrew C Halley, Leah Krubitzer</p><div><p>A central question in comparative neurobiology concerns how evolution has produced brains with expanded neocortices, composed of more areas with unique connectivity and functional properties. Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.</p></div>

In the inner ear, the deflection of hair bundles, the sensory organelles of hair cells, activates mechanically-gated channels (MGCs). Hair bundles monitor orientation of the head, its angular and linear acceleration, and detect sound. Force applied to MGCs is shaped by intrinsic hair-bundle properties, by the mechanical load on the bundle, and by the filter imparted by the environment of the hair bundle. Channel gating and adaptation, the ability of the bundle to reset its operating point, contribute to hair-bundle mechanics.

Engram cells can encode and switch between multiple mnemonic functions, but how they intrinsically do so is unknown. Pignatelli, Ryan, and colleagues show that upon memory recall, the engram’s excitability is transiently elevated, allowing its bearer to adapt to changing environments.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Fabian Rentzsch, Celina Juliano, Brigitte Galliot</p><div><p>Cnidarians shared a common ancestor with bilaterians more than 600 million years ago. This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Megan Crow, Jesse Gillis</p><div><p>Recent technical advances have enabled transcriptomics experiments at an unprecedented scale, and single-cell profiles from neural tissue are accumulating rapidly. There has been considerable effort to use these profiles to understand cell diversity, primarily through unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis. However, current practices to validate these findings vary. In this review, we describe recent efforts to evaluate clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and provide a framework for considering current evidence and practices in terms of their capacity to establish principles of cell biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has already transformed neuroscience. By facilitating detailed comparative and genetic perturbation analyses, it may provide the tools to uncover fundamental mechanisms of neural diversity throughout the tree of life.</p></div>
