              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternation emerges as a multi-modal strategy for turbulent odor navigation</a></h4>

              
                Foraging mammals exhibit a familiar yet poorly characterized phenomenon, 'alternation', a pause to sniff in the air preceded by the animal rearing on its hind legs or raising its head. Rodents spontaneously alternate in the presence of airflow, suggesting that alternation serves an important role during plume-tracking. To test this hypothesis, we combine fully-resolved simulations of turbulent odor transport and Bellman optimization methods for decision-making under partial observability. We show that an agent trained to minimize search time in a realistic odor plume exhibits extensive alternation together with the characteristic cast-and-surge behavior observed in insects. Alternation is linked with casting and occurs more frequently far downwind of the source, where the likelihood of detecting airborne cues is higher relative to ground cues. Casting and alternation emerge as complementary tools for effective exploration with sparse cues. A model based on marginal value theory captures the interplay between casting, surging and alternation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Polycomb-mediated repression of paternal chromosomes maintains haploid dosage in diploid embryos of Marchantia</a></h4>

              
                Complex mechanisms regulate gene dosage throughout eukaryotic life cycles. Mechanisms controlling gene dosage have been extensively studied in animals, however it is unknown how generalizable these mechanisms are to diverse eukaryotes. Here, we use the haploid plant <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> to assess gene dosage control in its short-lived diploid embryo. We show that throughout embryogenesis, paternal chromosomes are repressed resulting in functional haploidy. The paternal genome is targeted for genomic imprinting by the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 starting at fertilization, rendering the maternal genome in control of embryogenesis. Maintaining haploid gene dosage by this new form of imprinting is essential for embryonic development. Our findings illustrate how haploid-dominant species can regulate gene dosage through paternal chromosome inactivation and initiates the exploration of the link between life cycle history and gene dosage in a broader range of organisms.

	<p>Background: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the sensory thalamus has been proposed for 40 years to treat medically refractory neuropathic pain, but its efficacy remains partial and unpredictable. Recent pilot studies of DBS targeting the ACC, a brain region involved in the integration of the affective, emotional, and cognitive aspects of pain, may improve patients suffering from refractory chronic pain. ACC-DBS could be complementary to thalamic DBS to treat both the sensory-discriminative and the affective components of chronic pain, but the safety of combined DBS, especially on cognition and affects, has not been studied. Methods: We propose a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and bicentric study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bilateral ACC-DBS combined with unilateral thalamic DBS in adult patients suffering from chronic unilateral neuropathic pain, refractory to medical treatment. After a study period of six months, there is a cross-over randomized phase to compare the efficacy (evaluated by pain intensity and quality of life) and safety (evaluated by repeated neurological examination, psychiatric assessment, cognitive assessment, and assessment of affective functions) of combined ACC-thalamic DBS and thalamic DBS only, respectively. Discussion: The EMOPAIN study will show if ACC-DBS is a safe and effective therapy for patients suffering from chronic unilateral neuropathic pain, refractory to medical treatment. The design of the study will, for the first time, assess the efficacy of ACC-DBS combined with thalamic DBS in a blinded way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The implementation of a competency-based nursing curriculum in a developing country: A qualitative descriptive study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Competency-based nursing curricula prepare nurse graduates with the required competencies to function effectively in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex healthcare environment. Implementation of a competency-based curriculum requires considerable investment in time and resources, and this process has not been described in Vietnam, a developing country. This research explores nurse educators' experiences from six Vietnamese nursing schools regarding implementing a competency-based nursing curriculum through the lens of McGrath’s Input-Process-Output model. Methods: A qualitative descriptive method was used. A total of 11 participants were nurse academics purposively chosen from six nursing schools where a competency-based nursing curriculum has been implemented, and 11 in-depth interviews were conducted. Results: Participants identified various issues in implementing a competency-based nursing curriculum, including the need for curriculum redesign, required improvements in teaching and learning, and resistance from teaching staff. Adequate human resources and the availability of infrastructure facilitated the process. Simultaneously, barriers to implementation included nurse educators with poor preparation for a new curriculum, inadequate infrastructure, limited equipment, and no policies that support a competency-based curriculum. Conclusions: The study findings describe the process of moving to a competency-based nursing curriculum implementation in a low to the middle-income country from the perspective of nurse educators and indicate critical success factors in facilitating the process in similar environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Optical coherence tomography angiography findings in radiation retinopathy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We report the observation of a 31-year-old patient followed for a nasopharyngeal carcinoma since 2009, treated by locoregional radiotherapy, with a cumulative dose of 70 Gray.  This case presented all ocular complications of radiotherapy; radiation retinopathy (RR), which is the most severe complication, could be diagnosed earlier and have a better prognosis if optic coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was performed. She presented with a progressive decline in bilateral visual acuity. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral posterior subcapsular cataract, radiation retinopathy, and optic neuropathy. The OCT B-scan showed more pronounced macular edema in the right eye.  The OCTA revealed enlargement of the central avascular zone and loss of the deep and superficial retinal vascular network. The patient received three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), without improvement in visual acuity. The aim of this case report is to present the contribution of OCT-A in the diagnosis of radiation maculopathy, and attribute these changes to ischemia at the level of the retinal vascular network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SPEACH_AF: Sampling protein ensembles and conformational heterogeneity with Alphafold2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard A. Stein, Hassane S. Mchaourab</p>

The unprecedented performance of Deepmind’s Alphafold2 in predicting protein structure in CASP XIV and the creation of a database of structures for multiple proteomes and protein sequence repositories is reshaping structural biology. However, because this database returns a single structure, it brought into question Alphafold’s ability to capture the intrinsic conformational flexibility of proteins. Here we present a general approach to drive Alphafold2 to model alternate protein conformations through simple manipulation of the multiple sequence alignment via <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis. The approach is grounded in the hypothesis that the multiple sequence alignment must also encode for protein structural heterogeneity, thus its rational manipulation will enable Alphafold2 to sample alternate conformations. A systematic modeling pipeline is benchmarked against canonical examples of protein conformational flexibility and applied to interrogate the conformational landscape of membrane proteins. This work broadens the applicability of Alphafold2 by generating multiple protein conformations to be tested biologically, biochemically, biophysically, and for use in structure-based drug design.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring tumor-specific cancer dependencies through integrating ex vivo drug response assays and drug-protein profiling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alina Batzilla, Junyan Lu, Jarno Kivioja, Kerstin Putzker, Joe Lewis, Thorsten Zenz, Wolfgang Huber</p>

The development of cancer therapies may be improved by the discovery of tumor-specific molecular dependencies. The requisite tools include genetic and chemical perturbations, each with its strengths and limitations. Chemical perturbations can be readily applied to primary cancer samples at large scale, but mechanistic understanding of hits and further pharmaceutical development is often complicated by the fact that a chemical compound has affinities to multiple proteins. To computationally infer specific molecular dependencies of individual cancers from their <i>ex vivo</i> drug sensitivity profiles, we developed a mathematical model that deconvolutes these data using measurements of protein-drug affinity profiles. Through integrating a drug-kinase profiling dataset and several drug response datasets, our method, DepInfeR, correctly identified known protein kinase dependencies, including the EGFR dependence of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, the FLT3 dependence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <i>FLT3</i>-ITD mutations and the differential dependencies on the B-cell receptor pathway in the two major subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Furthermore, our method uncovered new subgroup-specific dependencies, including a previously unreported dependence of high-risk CLL on Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1). The method also produced a detailed map of the kinase dependencies in a heterogeneous set of 117 CLL samples. The ability to deconvolute polypharmacological phenotypes into underlying causal molecular dependencies should increase the utility of high-throughput drug response assays for functional precision oncology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modeling of the molecular switch of TNFR1-mediated signaling pathways applying Petri net formalism and in silico knockout analysis</a></h4>

The paper describes a mathematical model of the molecular switches of cell survival, apoptosis, and necroptosis in cellular signaling pathways initiated by tumor necrosis factor 1. Based on experimental findings in the literature, we constructed a Petri net model based on detailed molecular reactions of the molecular players, protein complexes, post-translational modifications, and cross talk. The model comprises 118 biochemical entities, 130 reactions, and 299 edges. We verified the model by evaluating invariant properties of the system at steady state and by <i>in silico</i> knockout analysis. Applying Petri net analysis techniques, we found 279 pathways, which describe signal flows from receptor activation to cellular response, representing the combinatorial diversity of functional pathways.120 pathways steered the cell to survival, whereas 58 and 35 pathways led to apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively. For 65 pathways, the triggered response was not deterministic and led to multiple possible outcomes. We investigated the <i>in silico</i> knockout behavior and identified important checkpoints of the TNFR1 signaling pathway in terms of ubiquitination within complex I and the gene expression dependent on NF-κB, which controls the caspase activity in complex II and apoptosis induction. Despite not knowing enough kinetic data of sufficient quality, we estimated system’s dynamics using a discrete, semi-quantitative Petri net model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How growers make decisions impacts plant disease control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rachel E. Murray-Watson, Frédéric M. Hamelin, Nik J. Cunniffe</p>

While the spread of plant disease depends strongly on biological factors driving transmission, it also has a human dimension. Disease control depends on decisions made by individual growers, who are in turn influenced by a broad range of factors. Despite this, human behaviour has rarely been included in plant epidemic models. Considering Cassava Brown Streak Disease, we model how the perceived increase in profit due to disease management influences participation in clean seed systems (CSS). Our models are rooted in game theory, with growers making strategic decisions based on the expected profitability of different control strategies. We find that both the information used by growers to assess profitability and the perception of economic and epidemiological parameters influence long-term participation in the CSS. Over-estimation of infection risk leads to lower participation in the CSS, as growers perceive that paying for the CSS will be futile. Additionally, even though good disease management can be achieved through the implementation of CSS, and a scenario where all controllers use the CSS is achievable when growers base their decision on the average of their entire strategy, CBSD is rarely eliminated from the system. These results are robust to stochastic and spatial effects. Our work highlights the importance of including human behaviour in plant disease models, but also the significance of how that behaviour is included.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Different forms of superspreading lead to different outcomes: Heterogeneity in infectiousness and contact behavior relevant for the case of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elise J. Kuylen, Andrea Torneri, Lander Willem, Pieter J. K. Libin, Steven Abrams, Pietro Coletti, Nicolas Franco, Frederik Verelst, Philippe Beutels, Jori Liesenborgs, Niel Hens</p>

Superspreading events play an important role in the spread of several pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. While the basic reproduction number of the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be about 3 for Belgium, there is substantial inter-individual variation in the number of secondary cases each infected individual causes—with most infectious individuals generating no or only a few secondary cases, while about 20% of infectious individuals is responsible for 80% of new infections. Multiple factors contribute to the occurrence of superspreading events: heterogeneity in infectiousness, individual variations in susceptibility, differences in contact behavior, and the environment in which transmission takes place. While superspreading has been included in several infectious disease transmission models, research into the effects of different forms of superspreading on the spread of pathogens remains limited. To disentangle the effects of infectiousness-related heterogeneity on the one hand and contact-related heterogeneity on the other, we implemented both forms of superspreading in an individual-based model describing the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic Belgian population. We considered its impact on viral spread as well as on epidemic resurgence after a period of social distancing. We found that the effects of superspreading driven by heterogeneity in infectiousness are different from the effects of superspreading driven by heterogeneity in contact behavior. On the one hand, a higher level of infectiousness-related heterogeneity results in a lower risk of an outbreak persisting following the introduction of one infected individual into the population. Outbreaks that did persist led to fewer total cases and were slower, with a lower peak which occurred at a later point in time, and a lower herd immunity threshold. Finally, the risk of resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown decreased. On the other hand, when contact-related heterogeneity was high, this also led to fewer cases in total during persistent outbreaks, but caused outbreaks to be more explosive in regard to other aspects (such as higher peaks which occurred earlier, and a higher herd immunity threshold). Finally, the risk of resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown increased. We found that these effects were conserved when testing combinations of infectiousness-related and contact-related heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An evaluation of the three measurable cardinal objectives of the National Youth Service Corps programme: a survey dataset [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The National Youth Service Corps programme is, among other targets, aimed at promoting national inclusiveness and tolerance in a culturally heterogeneous society. Despite the importance of this programme, little has been done to evaluate its degree of success. Where evaluations are done, they are never made public. There is a need for the NYSC programme, just like all other public programmes, to be evaluated for transparency, accountability and decision-making. From an evaluation of the three measurable objectives of the NYSC programme, this dataset bridges this gap. Methods: This dataset was collected from Nigerian graduates that completed their national service between 2012 and 2021. The data was collected through an electronic survey posted to various online platforms hosting National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members of the various sets and batches. The data collection aimed to evaluate the three cardinal objectives of the programme. After three years of data collection (from 2019 to 2021), responses were obtained from 19,278 participants that met the eligibility criteria. The data is an Excel (.xlsx) document with 19,278 cases and 95 variables. Descriptive statistics such as frequency counts and simple percentages were used to summarise the data. However, charts are further used to illustrate the demographic attributes of the respondents. The dataset is broad and covers all the 36 states in Nigeria plus the Federal Capital Territory. Results: The data set has many reuse potentials because it contains information on camp activities (such as parades, military drills, redeployment, quality of food, and facilities, among others), primary assignments and community service engagements of corps members. Conclusions: The data can offer a complete evaluation of how the (NYSC) has attained three of its four cardinal objectives. A series of relationships can further be determined and tested using inferential statistics among the variables included in the dataset.

                Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in anti-tumor immunity by inducing T cell differentiation. Herein, we found that the DC mechanical sensor Piezo1 stimulated by mechanical stiffness or inflammatory signals directs the reciprocal differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 and regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells in cancer. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in DCs inhibited the generation of T<sub>H</sub>1 cells while driving the development of T<sub>reg</sub> cells in promoting cancer growth in mice. Mechanistically, Piezo1-deficient DCs regulated the secretion of the polarizing cytokines TGFβ1 and IL-12, leading to increased TGFβR2-p-Smad3 activity and decreased IL-12Rβ2-p-STAT4 activity while inducing the reciprocal differentiation of T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. In addition, Piezo1 integrated the SIRT1-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α)-dependent metabolic pathway and calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway to orchestrate reciprocal T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>reg</sub> lineage commitment through DC-derived IL-12 and TGFβ1. Our studies provide critical insight for understanding the role of the DC-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing T cell lineage commitment in tumor microenvironments.

                Replay, the sequential reactivation within a neuronal ensemble, is a central hippocampal mechanism postulated to drive memory processing. While both rate and place representations are used by hippocampal place cells to encode behavioral episodes, replay has been largely defined by only the latter – based on the fidelity of sequential activity across neighboring place fields. Here we show that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts. This experience-dependent phenomenon mirrors the same pattern of rate modulation observed during behavior and can be used independently from place information within replay sequences to discriminate between contexts. Our results reveal the existence of two complementary neural representations available for memory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A regeneration-triggered metabolic adaptation is necessary for cell identity transitions and cell cycle re-entry to support blastema formation and bone regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Regeneration depends on the ability of mature cells at the injury site to respond to injury, generating tissue-specific progenitors that incorporate the blastema and proliferate to reconstitute the original organ architecture. The metabolic microenvironment has been tightly connected to cell function and identity during development and tumorigenesis. Yet, the link between metabolism and cell identity at the mechanistic level in a regenerative context remains unclear. The adult zebrafish caudal fin, and bone cells specifically, have been crucial for the understanding of mature cell contribution to tissue regeneration. Here, we use this model to explore the relevance of glucose metabolism for the cell fate transitions preceding new osteoblast formation and blastema assembly. We show that injury triggers a modulation in the metabolic profile at early stages of regeneration to enhance glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial oxidation. This metabolic adaptation mediates transcriptional changes that make mature osteoblast amenable to be reprogramed into pre-osteoblasts and induces cell cycle re-entry and progression. Manipulation of the metabolic profile led to severe reduction of the pre-osteoblast pool, diminishing their capacity to generate new osteoblasts, and to a complete abrogation of blastema formation. Overall, our data indicate that metabolic alterations have a powerful instructive role in regulating genetic programs that dictate fate decisions and stimulate proliferation, thereby providing a deeper understanding on the mechanisms regulating blastema formation and bone regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epac2 in midbrain dopamine neurons contributes to cocaine reinforcement via facilitation of dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in an upregulation of cAMP signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a molecular adaptation thought to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via enhancement of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2-cKO led to reduced evoked dopamine release, whereas Epac2 agonism robustly enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens <i>in vitro</i>. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic stimulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via deschloroclozapine (DCZ)-induced activation of Gs-DREADD increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons with Gi-DREADD reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated enhancement of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.

                The neocortex is organized around layered microcircuits consisting of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types which perform rate- and oscillation-based computations. Using modeling, we show that both superficial and deep layers of the primary mouse visual cortex implement two ultrasensitive and bistable switches built on mutual inhibitory connectivity motives between somatostatin, parvalbumin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide cells. The switches toggle pyramidal neurons between high and low firing rate states that are synchronized across layers through translaminar connectivity. Moreover, inhibited and disinhibited states are characterized by low- and high-frequency oscillations, respectively, with layer-specific differences in frequency and power which show asymmetric changes during state transitions. These findings are consistent with a number of experimental observations and embed firing rate together with oscillatory changes within a switch interpretation of the microcircuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Botulinum neurotoxin accurately separates tonic vs phasic transmission and reveals heterosynaptic plasticity rules in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In developing and mature nervous systems, diverse neuronal subtypes innervate common targets to establish, maintain, and modify neural circuit function. A major challenge towards understanding the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits is to separate these inputs and determine their intrinsic and heterosynaptic relationships. The <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junction is a powerful model system to study these questions, where two glutamatergic motor neurons, the strong phasic-like &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; and weak tonic-like &lt;strong&gt;Ib&lt;/strong&gt;, co-innervate individual muscle targets to coordinate locomotor behavior. However, complete neurotransmission from each input has never been electrophysiologically separated. We have employed a botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT-C, that eliminates both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission without perturbing synaptic growth or structure, enabling the first approach that accurately isolates input-specific neurotransmission. Selective expression of BoNT-C in Is or Ib motor neurons disambiguates the functional properties of each input. Importantly, the blended values of Is+Ib neurotransmission can be fully recapitulated by isolated physiology from each input. Finally, selective silencing by BoNT-C does not induce heterosynaptic structural or functional plasticity at the convergent input. Thus, BoNT-C establishes the first approach to accurately separate neurotransmission between tonic vs phasic neurons and defines heterosynaptic plasticity rules in a powerful model glutamatergic circuit.

Using volumetric two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice, here we simultaneously recorded the activity of ~1,000 IC neurons in response to sounds delivered from 13 different frontal horizontal locations (azimuths). The population responses showed marked trial-to-trial variability and revealed the recruitment of distinct groups of noise-correlated IC neurons as a function of stimulus azimuth. We tested decoding model performance on our data and found that template matching outperformed previously proposed models, where noise correlations helped improve the decoding accuracy. Finally, our volumetric imaging approach revealed that both the central nucleus and dorsal cortex of IC contribute to sound location coding. These findings indicate that noise correlations, together with azimuth tuning, play a key role in shaping the population code for sound location in the mammalian IC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting Dementia Severity by Merging Anatomical and Diffusion MRI with Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning methods have been used for over a decade for staging and subtyping a variety of brain diseases, offering fast and objective methods to classify neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been used to infer dementia severity and predict future clinical decline. Most CNN-based deep learning models use T1-weighted brain MRI scans to identify predictive features for these tasks. In contrast, we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models of dementia severity. dMRI is sensitive to microstructural brain abnormalities not evident on standard anatomical MRI. By training CNNs on combined anatomical and diffusion MRI, we hypothesize that we could boost performance when predicting widely used clinical assessments of dementia severity, such as individuals scores on the ADAS11, ADAS13, and MMSE (mini-mental state exam) clinical scales. For benchmarking, we evaluate CNNs that use T1-weighted MRI and dMRI to estimate brain age - the task of predicting a persons chronological age from their neuroimaging data. To assess which dMRI-derived maps were most beneficial, we computed DWI-derived diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) maps of mean and radial diffusivity (MD/RD), axial diffusivity (AD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) for 1198 elderly subjects (age: 74.35 +/- 7.74 yrs.; 600 F/598 M, with a distribution of 636 CN/421 MCI/141 AD) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We tested both 2D Slice CNN and 3D CNN neural network models for the above predictive tasks. Our results suggest that for at least some deep learning architectures, diffusion-weighted MRI may enhance performance for several AD-relevant deep learning tasks relative to using T1-weighted images alone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for a travel direction signal in humans that is independent of head direction</a></h4>

              
                We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control: an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and it scaled with adaptation duration. These findings demonstrate the first evidence of how a pure travel direction signal might be represented in humans, independent of head direction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Valproic acid exposure alters social visual lateralization and asymmetric gene expression in zebrafish larvae</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of brain organization. Abnormal language hemispheric activation and differences in the prevalence of handedness have been observed in individuals with ASD, suggesting atypicality in cerebral structure and lateralization. Zebrafish are increasingly emerging among the key model species to study brain lateralization, with asymmetric development of the epithalamus as a model to investigate the relationship between brain asymmetry and behavior. We exposed zebrafish embryos at 5 hour post-fertilization to one micromolar dosage of valproic acid for 24 and 48 hours, assessed social interaction and visual lateralization in a social task, the mirror test, and measured gene expression changes in the thalamus and the telencephalon. We show that after exposure to valproic acid, zebrafish exhibit social deficits and alterations in lateralized social responses to their own reflected image. Valproic acid also induced changes in the asymmetric gene expression of the thalamic marker kctd12.1/leftover and had a significant effect on the expression of telencephalic genes known to be asymmetrically expressed in adult fish. Our data indicate that one micromolar doses of VPA are sufficient to neutralize both the visual field bias and the asymmetric epithalamic gene expression, opening new perspectives to investigate brain lateralization and its link to ASD in a zebrafish model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of Objecthood and Animacy in Apparent Movement Processing</a></h4>

              
                Movement perception involves both motion and form processing. Previous research has shown that processing along the motion pathway requires a familiar but not necessarily a human shape. However, the role of objecthood and animacy in the form pathway is less clear. Here, we used EEG frequency tagging to study how objecthood and animacy influence both posture processing and the integration of postures into movements. Specifically, we measured brain responses to repeating sequences of well-defined or pixelated images (objecthood) of human or corkscrew agents (animacy) performing fluent or non-fluent movements (movement fluency). The results revealed that movement processing was sensitive to objecthood but not to animacy, whereas posture processing was sensitive to both. Thus, our results indicate that movement processing in the form pathway requires a familiar shape, but not necessarily a human shape. Instead, stimulus animacy appears to be relevant only for posture processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The absence of gastrointestinal redox dyshomeostasis in the brain-first rat model of Parkinson's disease induced by bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine</a></h4>

              
                The gut-brain axis plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD) by acting as a route for vagal propagation of aggregated -synuclein in the gut-first endophenotype and as a mediator of gastrointestinal dyshomeostasis via the nigro-vagal pathway in the brain-first endophenotype of the disease. One important mechanism by which the gut-brain axis may promote PD is by regulating gastrointestinal redox homeostasis as overwhelming evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role in the etiopathogenesis and progression of PD and the gastrointestinal tract maintains redox homeostasis of the organism by acting as a critical barrier to environmental and microbiological electrophilic challenges. The present aim was to utilize the bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) brain-first PD model to study the effects of isolated central pathology on redox homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Three-month-old male Wistar rats were either not treated (intact controls; CTR) or treated bilaterally intrastriatally with vehicle (CIS) or 6-OHDA (6-OHDA). Motor deficits were assessed with the rotarod performance test and the duodenum, ileum, and colon were dissected for biochemical analyses 12 weeks after the treatment. Lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity, low-molecular thiols, and protein sulfhydryls, the activity of total and Mn/Fe superoxide dismutases, and total and azide-insensitive catalase/peroxidase were measured. Univariate and multivariate models of redox biomarkers provide solid evidence against the existence of pronounced gastrointestinal redox dyshomeostasis. The results indicate that the dysfunction of the nigro-vagal system and not motor deficit may be a key mediator of gastrointestinal dyshomeostasis in brain-first 6-OHDA-induced rodent models of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical interneuron development is affected in leukodystrophy 4H</a></h4>

              
                4H leukodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder classically characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. With the discovery that 4H is caused by mutations that affect RNA polymerase III, mainly involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, also patients with atypical presentations with mainly a neuronal phenotype were identified. Pathomechanisms of 4H brain abnormalities are still unknown and research is hampered by a lack of preclinical models. We aimed to identify cells and pathways that are affected by 4H mutations using induced pluripotent stem cell models. RNA sequencing analysis on induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebellar cells revealed several differentially expressed genes between 4H patients and control samples, including reduced ARX expression. As ARX is involved in early brain and interneuron development, we studied and confirmed interneuron changes in primary tissue of 4H patients. Subsequently, we studied interneuron changes in more depth and analyzed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neuron cultures for changes in neuronal morphology, synaptic balance, network activity and myelination. We showed a decreased percentage of GABAergic synapses in 4H, which correlated to increased neuronal network activity. Treatment of cultures with GABA antagonists led to a significant increase in neuronal network activity in control cells but not in 4H cells, also pointing to lack of inhibitory activity in 4H. Myelination and oligodendrocyte maturation in cultures with 4H neurons was normal, and treatment with sonic hedgehog agonist SAG did not improve 4H related neuronal phenotypes. qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of parvalbumin interneuron marker ERBB4, suggesting that the development rather than generation of interneurons may be affected in 4H. Together, these results indicate that interneurons are involved, possibly parvalbumin interneurons, in disease mechanisms of 4H leukodystrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence for cognitive impairment in an experimental rat model of knee osteoarthritis and associated chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Although chronic pain states have been associated with impaired cognitive functions, including memory and cognitive flexibility, the cognitive effects of osteoarthritis (OA) pain remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to measure cognitive function in the mono-iodoacetate (MIA) rat model of chronic OA-like knee pain. We used young adult male Lister hooded rats, which are well suited for cognitive testing. Rats received either a unilateral knee injection of MIA (3mg/50uL) or saline as control. Joint pain at rest was assessed for up to 12 weeks using weight-bearing asymmetry, and referred pain at a distal site using determination of hindpaw withdrawal thresholds (PWT). The watermaze delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) test of rapid place learning, novel object recognition (NOR) memory assay and an operant response-shift and -reversal task were used to measure memory and behavioural flexibility. Open field locomotor activity, startle response, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were also measured for comparison. MIA-injected rats showed markedly reduced weight-bearing on the injured limb, as well as pronounced cartilage damage and synovitis, but interestingly no changes in PWT. Rearing was reduced, but otherwise locomotor activity was normal and no changes in startle and PPI were detected. MIA-injected rats had intact watermaze DMP performance, suggesting no substantial change in hippocampal function, and there were no changes in NOR memory or performance on the operant task of behavioural flexibility. Our finding that OA-like pain does not alter hippocampal function, unlike other chronic pain conditions, is consistent with human neuroimaging findings.

                Background: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have impaired general motor skills compared to typically developed (TD) individuals. Aims: To gain knowledge on how young adults with DS learn and retain new motor skills. Methods and Procedures: A DS-group (mean age = 23.9 +/- 3 years, N = 11), and an age-matched TD-group (mean age 22.8 +/- 1.8, N= 14) were recruited. The participants practiced a sequence visuomotor accuracy tracking task (VATT). Online and offline effects of practice were assessed in immediate and 7-day retention tests. Participants practiced the task in seven blocks (10.6 minutes). Outcomes and Results: The TD-group performed better than the DS-group in all blocks (all P < 0.001). Both groups improved VATT-performance online from baseline to immediate retention (all P < 0.001). The DS-groups' performance at 7-day retention was at the same level as the immediate retention tests ({Delta}DS). An offline decrease in performance was found in the TD-group ({Delta}TD, P < 0.001). A between-group difference was observed in the offline effect on the sequence task ({Delta}TD - {Delta}DS, P = 0.04). Conclusions and Implications: The motor performance of adults with DS is lower compared to their TD peers. However, adults with DS display significant online performance improvement during training, and offline consolidation following motor learning.

                Neurodegeneration is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its effect on neural activity dynamics underlying memory deficits is unclear. Here, we studied the effects of synaptic degeneration on neural activities associated with memory recall, memory rescue by slow-gamma stimulation, and learning a new memory, in an integrate-and-fire neuronal network. Our results showed that reducing connectivity decreases the neuronal synchronisation of memory neurons at slow-gamma frequencies and impairs memory recall performance. Although slow-gamma stimulation rescued memory recall and slow-gamma oscillations, the rescue with reduced connectivity caused a side effect of activating mixed memories. During the learning of a new memory, reducing connectivity caused an impairment in storing the new memory, but did not affect previously stored memories. Our results reveal potential computational mechanisms underlying the memory deficits caused by synaptic degeneration in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual risk attitudes arise from noise in neurocognitive magnitude representations</a></h4>

              
                Humans are generally risk averse: they prefer options with smaller certain outcomes over those with larger uncertain ones. This risk aversion is classically explained with a concave utility function, meaning that successive increases in monetary payoffs should increase subjective valuations by progressively smaller amounts. Here, we provide neural and behavioural evidence that risk aversion may also arise from a purely perceptual bias: The noisy logarithmic coding of numerical magnitudes can lead individuals to underestimate the size of larger monetary payoffs, leading to apparent risk aversion even when subjective valuation increases linearly with the estimated amount. A formal model of this process predicts that risk aversion should systematically increase when individuals represent numerical magnitudes more noisily. We confirmed this prediction by measuring both the mental and neural acuity of magnitude representations during a purely perceptual task and relating these measures to individual risk attitudes during separate financial decisions. Computational model fitting suggested that subjects based both types of choices on similar mental magnitude representations, with correlated precision across the separate perceptual and risky choices. Increased stimulus noise due to the presentation format of risky outcomes led to increased risk aversion, just as predicted by the model. The precision of the underlying neural magnitude representations was estimated with a numerical population receptive field model fitted to the fMRI data of the perceptual task. Subjects with more precise magnitude representations in parietal cortex indeed showed less variable behaviour and less risk-aversion in the separate financial choices. Our results highlight that individual patterns of economic behaviour may, at least partially, be determined by capacity limitations in perceptual processing rather than by processes that assign subjective values to monetary rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha-synuclein pathology and reduced neurogenesis in the olfactory system affect olfaction in a mouse model of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson Disease (PD) is characterized by multiple symptoms including olfactory dysfunction, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we explored pathological changes in the olfactory pathway of transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human A30P mutant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) (alpha-syn-Tg mice) at 6-7 and 12-14 months of age, representing early and late-stages of motor progression, respectively. alpha-Syn-Tg mice at late stages exhibited olfactory behavioral deficits, which correlated with severe alpha-syn pathology in projection neurons of the olfactory pathway. In parallel, olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis in alpha-syn-Tg mice was reduced in the OB granule cells at 6-7 months, and OB periglomerular cells at 12-14 months, respectively, both of which could contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Proteomic analyses showed a disruption in endo- and exocytic pathways in the OB during the early stages which appeared exacerbated at the synaptic terminals when the mice developed olfactory deficits at 12-14 months. Our data suggest that, 1) the alpha-syn-Tg mice recapitulate the olfactory functional deficits seen in PD; 2) olfactory structures exhibit spatiotemporal disparities for vulnerability to alpha-syn pathology; 3) alpha-syn pathology is restricted to projection neurons in the olfactory pathway; 4) neurogenesis in adult alpha-syn-Tg mice is reduced in the OB; and 5) synaptic endo- and exocytosis defects in the OB may further explain olfactory deficits.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in rodents holds great potential for advancing our understanding of brain networks. However, rodent fMRI lags the human community with regards to the availability of image processing softwares to support reproducibility, a significant challenge facing neuroimaging. To address these shortcomings, we introduce RABIES, a novel pipeline designed along best practices for reproducibility and transparency handling processing stages from image registration to data quality assessment during analysis. First, we present a robust registration workflow validated across both acquisition sites and species. Leveraging insights from the human literature, we introduce a novel framework for data quality assessment of single scans and during group-level network analysis. This framework will support the development of standardized high-quality acquisition protocols and harmonization of findings between studies. Taken together, the RABIES software will allow the emerging community to adopt reproducible practices and foster progress in translational neuroscience.

                Neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) have been traditionally viewed as a homogenous population. Recent studies are beginning to uncover heterogeneous molecular phenotypes and projection targets in this nucleus, but how such heterogeneity is ultimately manifested in neuronal physiology and function is largely unknown. We took an orthogonal approach to directly assess the physiological and functional heterogeneity in the LC. By identifying noradrenergic neurons using a genetic-based tagging approach, our study revealed a subset of neurons exhibiting a distinctive narrow spike waveform and lacking the prolonged after-hyperpolarization. We further provided evidence establishing a link between the proximity of LC neurons and their response latency, where putatively proximal neurons tended to have a long latency to optogenetic activation. Finally, we found that response latency of LC neurons was correlated with their burst firing and distinct relationship with pupil diameter. Together, our study presents novel evidence to reveal and link LC heterogeneity at the physiological level to that at the functional level.

                The discrete behavioral events captured on the smartphone touchscreen may help unravel real-world neural processing. We find that neural signals (EEG) surrounding a touchscreen event show peculiarly contralateral motor preparation, visual processing, and the consolidation of information. We leveraged these events in conjunction with kinematic recordings of the thumb and an artificial neural network to separate highly similar movements according to whether they resulted in a smartphone touch (goal-directed) or not (non-goal-directed). Despite their kinematic similarity underscored by the model, the signatures of neural control of movement and the post-movement processing were substantially dampened for the non-goal-directed movements, and these movements uniquely evoked error-related signals. We speculate that these unnecessary movements are common in the real world and although inconsequential the brain still provides limited motor preparation and tracks the action outcome. Real-world behavior is composed of neural processes that are difficult to capture in conventional laboratory-based tasks.

                Left inattention is common in individuals following right cerebrovascular accident (RCVA). In neurotypical adults, we have previously found prolonged rightward visual attention resulted in a subsequent increase in leftward attention. Here we applied the same method in neurological patients with RCVA and found improved post-intervention attention both to the left and right of visual fixation in participants with mild to no leftward inattention in comparison to a control. No such benefit was detected in participants with more pronounced leftward inattention. Given the feasibility of the intervention which leverages performance in the right unaffected visual space, future studies should examine the longevity and generalizability of such an intervention to other attention demanding tasks.

                Pain affects over 50% of US adults. Opioids are potent analgesics used to treat pain symptoms but are highly prone to abuse, creating a major dilemma for public health. Evidence suggests that the proclivity for opioid abuse under pain conditions varies between sexes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific effects of pain on opioid use are largely unclear. Here, we recapitulate clinical findings and demonstrate that pain increases self-administration of the widely abused opioid, fentanyl, selectively in male rats. These behavioral effects develop over time and are paralleled by sex- and pain-specific effects on fentanyl-evoked ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neuron activity, a critical mediator of motivation and reward. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we show that tonic VTA DA neuron activity is attenuated in males with pain. In contrast, phasic VTA DA neuron responses to self-administered fentanyl increase in magnitude at later timepoints and correspond with increases in fentanyl intake. The protracted increase in fentanyl-evoked VTA DA activity is necessary for pain to enhance fentanyl self-administration in males because chemogenetic inhibition of VTA DA neurons normalized fentanyl intake and associated fentanyl-evoked VTA DA neuron responses. These findings reveal time-dependent and sex-specific pain-induced adaptations to VTA DA neuron function that underlie maladaptive patterns of opioid use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual projection neuron convergence and compensation in developing sensorimotor circuits in the Drosophila optic glomeruli</a></h4>

              
                Visual features detected by the early visual system must be combined into higher order representations to guide behavioral decision. Although key developmental mechanisms that enable the separation of visual feature channels in early visual circuits have been discovered, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that underlie their convergence in later stages of visual processing. Here we explore the development of a functionally well-characterized sensorimotor circuit in Drosophila melanogaster, the convergence of visual projection neurons (VPNs) onto the dendrites of a large descending neuron called the giant fiber (GF). We find two VPNs encoding different visual features that target the same giant fiber dendrite establish their territories on the dendrite, in part, through sequential axon arrival during development prior to synaptogenesis. Physical occupancy is important to maintain territories, as we find the ablation of one VPN results in expanded dendrite territory of the remaining VPN, and that this compensation enables the GF to remain responsive to ethologically relevant visual stimuli. Our data highlight temporal mechanisms for visual feature convergence and promote the GF circuit, and the Drosophila optic glomeruli where VPN to GF connectivity resides, as an ideal developmental model for investigating complex wiring programs and plasticity in visual feature convergence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model based control can give rise to devaluation insensitive choice</a></h4>

              
                Influential recent work aims to ground psychiatric dysfunction in the brain's basic computational mechanisms. For instance, compulsive symptoms as in drug abuse have been argued to arise from an imbalance between multiple systems for instrumental learning. Computational models suggest that such multiplicity arises because the brain adaptively simplifies laborious "model-based" deliberation by sometimes relying on a cheaper, more habitual "model-free" shortcut. Support for this account comes in part from failures to appropriately change behaviour in light of new events. Notably, instrumental responding can, in some circumstances, persist despite reinforcer devaluation, perhaps reflecting control by model-free mechanisms that are driven by past reinforcement rather than knowledge of the (now devalued) outcome. However, another important line of theory, heretofore mostly studied in Pavlovian conditioning, posits a different mechanism that can also modulate behavioural change. It concerns how animals identify different rules or contingencies that may apply in different circumstances, by covertly clustering experiences into distinct groups identified with different "latent causes" or contexts. Such clustering has been used to explain the return of Pavlovian responding following extinction. Here we combine both lines of theory to investigate the consequences of latent cause inference on instrumental sensitivity to reinforcer devaluation. We show that because segregating events into different latent clusters prevents generalization between them, instrumental insensitivity to reinforcer devaluation can arise in this theory even using only model-based planning, and does not require or imply any habitual, model-free component. In simulations, these ersatz habits (like laboratory ones) emerge after overtraining, interact with contextual cues, and show preserved sensitivity to reinforcer devaluation on a separate consumption test, a standard control. While these results do not rule out a contribution of model-free learning per se, they point to a subtle and important role of state inference in instrumental learning and highlight the need for caution in using reinforcer devaluation procedures to rule in (or out) the contribution of different learning mechanisms. They also offer a new perspective on the neurocomputational substrates of drug abuse and the relevance of laboratory reinforcer devaluation procedures to this phenomenon.

                The sense of direction is critical for survival in changing environments and relies on flexibly integrating self-motion signals with external sensory cues. While the anatomical substrates involved in head direction (HD) coding are well known, the mechanisms by which visual information updates HD representations remain poorly understood. Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in forming coherent representations of space in mammals and it encodes a variety of navigational variables, including HD. Here, we use simultaneous two-area tetrode recording to show that RSC HD representation is nearly synchronous with that of the anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (ADn), the obligatory thalamic relay of HD to cortex, during rotation of a prominent visual cue. Moreover, coordination of HD representations in the two regions is maintained during darkness. We further show that anatomical and functional connectivity are consistent with a strong feedforward drive of HD information from ADn to RSC, with surprisingly little reciprocal drive in the corticothalamic direction. Together, our results provide direct evidence for a concerted global HD reference update across cortex and thalamus, and establish the underlying functional connectivity that supports this coordination.

                Complex motor skills in vertebrates require specialized upper motor neurons with precise action potential (AP) firing. To examine how diverse populations of upper motor neurons subserve distinct functions and the specific repertoire of ion channels involved, we conducted a thorough study of the excitability of upper motor neurons controlling somatic motor function in the zebra finch. We found that robustus arcopallialis projection neurons (RAPNs), key command neurons for song production, exhibit ultranarrow spikes and higher firing rates compared to neurons controlling non-vocal somatic motor functions (AId neurons). This striking difference was primarily due to the expression of a high threshold, fast-activating voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv3.1 (KCNC1). RAPN properties thus mirror those of the sparse, specialized Betz cells in the motor cortex of humans and other primates, which also fire ultranarrow spikes enabled by Kv3.1 expression. These large layer 5 pyramidal neurons are involved in fine digit control and are notably absent in rodents. Our study thus provides evidence that songbird RAPNs and primate Betz cells have convergently evolved the use of Kv3.1 to ensure precise, rapid AP firing required for fast and complex motor skills.

                Environmental cues influence microglial interaction with their neuronal landscape, often causing changes in microglial functional identity. This process demands rapid energy production, which is supported by an optimized mitochondrial network. Whether mitochondrial adaptations define a microglial functional state is unknown due to limitations in mitochondrial visualization and manipulation within their microenvironment. Here, we investigate the mitochondrial network of individual microglia in physiological and dysfunctional conditions during a naive or injury-induced mouse retinal environment. After optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, we identify mitochondrial and microglial phenotypic remodeling that is distinct from the naive environment. Remarkably, knockout of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) causes transient, stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion only in males after ONC, even though both sexes suffer from increased intrinsic stress levels. When we compare key metabolic genes between sexes in physiological conditions, only males exhibit a metabolic transition towards glycolysis in the injury-induced environment, which attenuates in UCP2 knockout resulting in acutely accelerated retinal ganglion cell death. Our data shows that the cell-extrinsic ONC environment and cell-intrinsic UCP2KO manipulation triggers several microglial states distinguishable by mitochondrial networks that are heavily influenced by sex and injury-induced stress.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Magnetogenetic closed-loop reduction of seizure activity in a rat model of epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                On-demand neurostimulation has shown success in epilepsy patients with pharmacoresistant seizures. Seizures produce magnetic fields that can be recorded using magnetoencephalography. We developed a new closed-loop approach to control seizure activity based on magnetogenetics using the electromagnetic perceptive gene (EPG) that encodes a protein that responds to magnetic fields. The EPG transgene was expressed in inhibitory interneurons under hDlx promoter and kainic acid was used to induce acute seizures. In vivo electrophysiological signals were recorded. We found that hDlx EPG rats exhibited a significant delay in the onset of first seizure (1142.72 {+/-} 186.35s) compared to controls (644.03 {+/-} 15.06s) and significantly less seizures (4.11 {+/-} 1.03) compared to controls (8.33 {+/-} 1.58). These preliminary findings suggest that on-demand activation of EPG expressed in inhibitory interneurons suppress seizure activity, and magnetogenetics via EPG may be an effective strategy to alleviate seizure severity in a minimally invasive, closed-loop and cell-specific fashion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Current progress in understanding Schizophrenia using genomics and pluripotent stem cells: A Meta-analytical overview</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable, polygenic neuropsychiatric disease, which disables the patients as well as decreases their life expectancy and quality of life. Common and Rare variants studies on SCZ subjects have provided more than 100 genomic loci that hold importance in the context of SCZ pathophysiology. Transcriptomic studies from clinical samples have informed about the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and non-coding RNAs in SCZ patients. Despite these advancements, no causative genes for SCZ were found and hence SCZ is difficult to recapitulate in animal models. In the last decade, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-based models have helped in understanding the neural phenotypes of SCZ by studying patient iPSC-derived 2D neuronal cultures and 3D brain organoids. Here, we have aimed to provide a simplistic overview of the current progress and advancements after synthesizing the enormous literature on SCZ genetics and SCZ iPSC-based models. Although further understanding of SCZ genetics and mechanisms using these technological advancements is required, the recent approaches have allowed to delineate important cellular mechanisms and biological pathways affected in SCZ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-dependent role of hypocretin/orexin neurons in social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Intraspecies social interactions are integral for survival and maintenance of society among all mammalian species. Yet, our understanding of the neural systems and mechanisms involved in the establishment of social connectedness are limited. Since their initial discovery as regulators of sleep/wakefulness and appetite in the brain, the hypocretin/orexin neurons have also been shown to play an essential role in modulating energy homeostasis, motivated and emotional behavior. These neurons are located exclusively in the hypothalamus which, regulates complex and goal-directed behaviors. The hypothalamus also plays an important role in the modulation of social behavior by encoding internal states. However, our understanding of the role of hypocretin neurons in social behavior is currently limited. To address this knowledge gap, we infused AAV encoding GCaMP6s into the lateral hypothalamus of female and male HcrtIRES-Cre mice and performed fiber photometry to record the activity of hypocretin neuron population during social interaction. We then applied optogenetic inhibition of hypocretin neurons to determine the necessity of these neurons for social behavior. Our results indicate that hypocretin neurons exhibit a robust increase in activity in response to social interaction in both female and male mice. We demonstrate the hypocretin neuron population is differentially activated during interaction between familiar and stranger conspecifics. The optogenetic inhibition of hypocretin neuron activity during social behavior leads to a reduction in the amount of time mice are engaged in social interaction in males but not in females. Together, these data implicate the lateral hypothalamus hypocretin neurons as a key regulator within the larger network of neural systems involved in social behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increasing the efficacy of exposure using a whole brain approach to real-time fMRI neurofeedback among female victims of interpersonal violence</a></h4>

              
                Individuals who experience interpersonal violence (IPV) and poly-victimization have an increased likelihood of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and statistically, women are more likely than men to be victims of IPV, experience poly-victimization, and develop PTSD. Current gold-standard PTSD treatments utilize exposure, a key mechanism of change; however, exposure-based treatments suffer from moderate remission rates. This outcome underscores the importance of utilizing knowledge of neural mechanisms to increase treatment effectiveness and PTSD remission rates. The current study used a symptom provocation paradigm, which is conceptually similar to exposure, and whole brain multivariate pattern classifiers (MVPC) to provide participants with neurofeedback on their ability to regulate their brain-states. In the MRI scanner, women (N = 21; control n = 11, PTSD n = 10) completed a symptom provocation paradigm. The MVPC was constructed during the first two runs and neurofeedback was given during the third and fourth run. During all four runs, participants were instructed to increase or decrease their emotional engagement with their stress/trauma script and during the last two runs, participants were provided visual feedback indicating their performance in regulating brain states. Skin conductance response was utilized as an independent measure of physiological arousal. Generalized linear models indicated a significant interaction effect of feedback and condition as well as feedback and group. Generalized linear models of skin conductance response largely mirrored these findings. Results indicate neurofeedback of whole brain activation can be utilized to increase engagement with trauma memories. Thus, exposure-based treatments, possibly with refractory cases of PTSD, may be improved with neurofeedback by providing the therapist and patient insight into their brain-state during exposure which may increase the effectiveness of exposure-based treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent changes in the dynamic functional organization of the brain at rest - a cross - cultural replication approach</a></h4>

              
                Age-associated changes in brain function play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Although previous work has examined age-related changes in static functional connectivity (FC), accumulating evidence suggests that advancing age is especially associated with alterations in the dynamic interactions and transitions between different brain states, which hitherto has received less attention. Moreover, conclusions of previous studies in this domain are limited by suboptimal replicability of resting state fMRI and culturally homogenous cohorts. Here, we investigate the robustness of age-associated changes in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) by capitalizing on the availability of fMRI cohorts from two cultures (Western European and Chinese). In both cohorts we consistently identify two distinct connectivity states: a more frequent segregated within-network connectivity state (state I) and a less frequent integrated between-network connectivity state (state II). In both cohorts, older (55-80 years) compared to younger participants (20-35 years) exhibited lower occurrence of and spent less time in state I. Moreover, older participants tended to exhibit more transitions between networks and greater variance in global efficiency. Overall, our cross-cultural replication of age-associated changes in key dFC metrics implies that advancing age is robustly associated with a reorganization of dynamic brain activation that favors the use of less functionally-specific networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HArtMuT - Modeling eye and muscle contributors in neuroelectric imaging</a></h4>

              
                Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measurements record a mix of signals from the brain, eyes, and muscles. These signals can be disentangled for artifact cleaning e.g. using spatial filtering techniques. However, correctly localizing and identifying these components relies on head models that so far only take brain sources into account. We thus developed the Head Artefact Model using Tripoles (HArtMuT). This volume conduction head model extends to the neck and includes brain sources as well as sources representing eyes and muscles that can be modeled as single dipoles, symmetrical dipoles, and tripoles. We compared a HArtMuT 4-layer Boundary Element Model (BEM) with the EEGLAB standard head model on their localization accuracy and residual variance (RV) using a HArtMuT Finite Element Model as ground truth. We also evaluated the RV on real-world data of mobile participants, comparing different HArtMuT BEM types with the EEGLAB standard head model. We found that HArtMuT improves localization for all sources, especially non-brain, and localization error and RV of non-brain sources were in the same range as those of brain sources. The best results were achieved by using cortical dipoles, muscular tripoles, and ocular symmetric dipoles, but dipolar sources alone can already lead to convincing results. We conclude that HArtMuT is well suited for modeling eye and muscle contributions to the M/EEG signal. It can be used to localize sources and to identify brain, eye, and muscle components. HArtMuT is freely available and can be integrated into standard software.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal regulation of ZBTB16 expression by glucocorticoids alters human cortical neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Glucocorticoids are important for proper organ maturation1. Increased exposure to these hormones during pregnancy, as a result of commonly prescribed synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone in preterm births2, has been associated with lasting effects on the offspring, including on neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric disease risk3. While the consequences of glucocorticoid excess in term and especially adult brain have been extensively studied, mainly in rodents4, studies on their effects during early human cortical development are absent. Here we use human cerebral organoids and mice to study cell-type specific effects of glucocorticoids on neurogenic processes. We show that glucocorticoid administration during neurogenesis alters the cellular architecture of the developing cortex by increasing a specific type of gyrencephalic species-enriched basal progenitors that co-express PAX6 and EOMES. This effect is mediated via the glucocorticoid-responsive transcription factor ZBTB16 as shown with overexpression, genetic knock-down and reporter assays experiments in organoids and embryonic mouse models and leads to increased production of deep-layer neurons. A phenome-wide mendelian randomization analysis of a genetic intronic enhancer variant that moderates glucocorticoid-induced ZBTB16 levels, as shown with enhancer assays and enhancer-editing in organoids, reveals potential causal relationships with increased educational attainment as well as neuroimaging phenotypes in adults. In this study we provide a cellular and molecular pathway for the effects of glucocorticoids on human neurogenesis that potentially explains postnatal phenotypes and may be used to refine treatment guidelines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Texture Coding In Higher Order Somatosensory Cortices</a></h4>

              
                Our sense of touch confers to us the ability to perceive textural features over a broad range of spatial scales and material properties, giving rise to a complex sensory experience. To understand the neural basis of texture perception requires that somatosensory neurons be stimulated with textures that tile the space of spatial scales and material properties experienced during everyday interactions with objects. We have previously shown that neurons in early stages of somatosensory processing - the nerves and somatosensory cortex (S1) - are highly sensitive to texture and carry a representation of texture that is highly informative about the surface but also predicts the evoked sensory experience. In contrast, the texture signals in higher order areas - secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and the parietal ventral area (PV) - have never been investigated with a rich and naturalistic textural set. To fill this gap, we recorded single-unit activity in S2/PV of macaques while they performed a texture discrimination task. We then characterized the neural responses to texture and compared these to their counterparts in somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that texture responses in S2/PV differ from their S1 counterparts in several ways. First, texture responses are far sparser in S2/PV than in S1: While individual S1 neurons respond promiscuously to most textures, S2/PV neurons tend to respond to only a few textures. Second, S2/PV responses co-vary only weakly with roughness, the dominant perceptual axis of texture. Third, S2/PV signals carry information about task variables - the animal's perceptual decision. Fourth, the millisecond scale temporal patterning in the texture response observed in S1 has all but disappeared in S2/PV.

	<p>Despite the fact that the urge to investigate bilingualism and neurodevelopmental disorders as continuous indices rather than categorical ones has been well-voiced among researchers with respect to research methodological approaches, in the recent literature, when it comes to examining language, cognitive skills and neurodivergent characteristics, it is still the case that the most prevalent view is the categorisation of adults or children into groups. In other words, there is a categorisation of individuals, e.g., monolingual vs. bilingual children or children with typical and atypical/non-typical/non-neurotypical development. We believe that this labelling is responsible for the conflicting results that we often come across in studies. The aim of this review is to bring to the surface the importance of individual differences through the study of relevant articles conducted in bilingual children and children with autism, who are ideal for this study. We concur with researchers who already do so, and we further suggest moving away from labels and instead shift towards the view that not everything is either white or black. We provide suggestions as to how this shift could be implemented in research, while mostly aiming at starting a discourse rather than offering a definite path.</p>

	<p>Research on the experiences of Arab families of children with autism living in non-Arab countries is scarce. A survey investigated the support needs, psychological distress, and parental relationships of Arab parents (n = 100) of children with autism living in the United Kingdom (UK). The survey consisted of five main questionnaires: a demographic questionnaire, the GO4KIDDS Brief Adaptive Scale, the Family Needs Survey, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Descriptive analysis indicated that the most frequently identified support needs were information, community services, and explaining to others. Parents reported high levels of psychological distress, a high level of parental relationship satisfaction with their spouse, and few parental disagreements about their child with autism. Regression analyses showed that increased child behavior problems predicted more total family needs. Higher levels of child prosocial behavior, the better health status of parents, and a larger number of children in the family were associated with lower levels of parental psychological distress. A longer time living in the UK was associated with more parental disagreement over issues related to the child with ASD. Reducing child behavior problems and increasing child prosocial behavior may be important targets for support and intervention to improve outcomes for Arab parents of autistic children.</p>

	<p>Current findings on brain structural alterations in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) are heterogenous and controversial. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the significant gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities between patients with CRPS and healthy controls (HCs). A systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases was performed, updated through 27 January 2022. A total of five studies (93 CRPS patients and 106 HCs) were included. Peak coordinates and effect sizes were extracted and meta-analyzed by anisotropic effect size&amp;amp;ndash;signed differential mapping (AES-SDM). Heterogeneity, sensitivity, and publication bias of the main results were checked by the Q test, jackknife analysis, and the Egger test, respectively. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the potential impact of risk factors on GMV alterations in patients with CRPS. The main analysis exhibited that patients with CRPS had increased GMV in the left medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmedial.L), left striatum, and an undefined area (2, 0, &amp;amp;minus;8) that may be in hypothalamus, as well as decreased GMV in the corpus callosum (CC) (extending to right supplementary motor area (SMA.R), right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCC.R)), and an undefined area (extending to the right caudate nucleus (CAU.R), and right thalamus (THA.R)). Meta-regression analysis showed a negative relationship between increased GMV in the SFGmedial.L and disease duration, and the percentage of female patients with CRPS. Brain structure abnormalities in the sensorimotor regions (e.g., SFGmedial.L, SMA.R, CAU.R, MCC.R, and THA.R) may be susceptible in patients with CRPS. Additionally, sex differences and disease duration may have a negative effect on the increased GMV in SFGmedial.L.</p>

     alt="Analysis of the distribution of vagal afferent projections from different peripheral organs to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats"/>
<p>We injected retrograde pseudotyped adeno-associated viruses into different peripheral organs and mapped the axonal projections of vagal viscerosensory neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We observed no obvious viscerotopy, with axons from different organs overlapping in NTS subnuclei and with NTS neurons of different neurochemical phenotype. The implications for deciphering this viscerosensory code are discussed.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anatomical tracing studies examining the vagal system can conflate details of sensory afferent and motor efferent neurons. Here, we used a serotype of adeno-associated virus that transports retrogradely and exhibits selective tropism for vagal afferents, to map their soma location and central termination sites within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We examined the vagal sensory afferents innervating the trachea, duodenum, stomach, or heart, and in some animals, from two organs concurrently. We observed no obvious somatotopy in the somata distribution within the nodose ganglion. The central termination patterns of afferents from different organs within the NTS overlap substantially. Convergence of vagal afferent inputs from different organs onto single NTS neurons is observed. Abdominal and thoracic afferents terminate throughout the NTS, including in the rostral NTS, where the 7th cranial nerve inputs are known to synapse. To address whether the axonal labeling produced by viral transduction is so widespread because it fills axons traveling to their targets, and not just terminal fields, we labeled pre and postsynaptic elements of vagal afferents in the NTS . Vagal afferents form multiple putative synapses as they course through the NTS, with each vagal afferent neuron distributing sensory signals to multiple second-order NTS neurons. We observe little selectivity between vagal afferents from different visceral targets and NTS neurons with common neurochemical phenotypes, with afferents from different organs making close appositions with the same NTS neuron. We conclude that specific viscerosensory information is distributed widely within the NTS and that the coding of this input is probably determined by the intrinsic properties and projections of the second-order neuron.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurogenic induction by Ngfr reduces reactive astrocytic Lcn2/Slc22a17 signalling, amyloid deposition and Tau phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Defects in neurogenic ability in humans could be a culprit of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Enhancing the neurogenic outcome in humans could enhance resilience to counteract neurodegeneration. However, molecular mechanisms that enhance neural stem cell neurogenic potential are largely unknown. We previously showed that zebrafish uses nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) signalling to enhance pathology-induced neurogenesis. Here, we show that induction of NGFR signalling in mouse astroglia also induce proliferative and neurogenic capacity in the APP/PS1dE9 AD mouse model. Single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown experiments showed that NGFR suppressed reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2). Blockage of Lcn2 receptor, Slc22a17, recapitulated the neurogenic effects of NGFR, and long-term NGFR expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Immunostaining on postmortem human hippocampi with AD or primary age-related Tauopathy and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with gliosis. Our study link the regulatory role of an autocrine molecular mechanism in astroglia to the neurogenic ability and modulatory effects on pathological hallmarks of AD, supporting the promise of neurogenesis-oriented therapeutic approaches as potential clinical interventions for this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre-symptomatic reduction of individuality in the App NL-F knock-in model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                While one third of the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained by environment and lifestyle, AD pathology also affects individual lifestyle, possibly long before clinical manifestation of dementia. To study this hidden disease effect with its potentially large impact on coping with AD, we examined in mice how the App NL-F/NL-F (NL-F) knock-in mutation affects the pre-symptomatic response to environmental enrichment (ENR). We assessed the emergence of inter-individual phenotypic variation while both genetic background and the shared environment were held constant, thereby isolating the contribution of individual behavior ('non-shared environment'). After 4 months of ENR, in NL-F both mean and variability of plasma ApoE were increased, suggesting a pre-symptomatic variation in pathogenic processes. Roaming entropy (RE) as a measure of behavioral activity was continuously assessed with radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology and revealed reduced habituation and variance in NL-F compared to controls. Intra-individual variation decreased but behavioral predictability and stability were reduced in NL-F. Seven months after discontinuation of ENR we found no difference in plaque size and number, but ENR increased variance in hippocampal plaque counts in NL-F. A reactive increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in NL-F, known from other models, was normalized by ENR. Our data suggest that, while NL-F has early effects on individual behavioral patterns in response to ENR, there are lasting effects at the level of cellular plasticity even after discontinuation of ENR. Hence, early behavior matters for maintaining individual behavioral trajectories and brain plasticity even under maximally constraint conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">3D reconstruction of the cerebellar germinal layer reveals intercytoplasmic connections between developing granule cells</a></h4>

              
                The difficulty of retrieving high-resolution, in vivo evidence of the proliferative- and migratory processes occurring in neural germinal zones has limited our understanding of neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Here, we employed a connectomic approach using a high-resolution, serial-sectioning scanning electron microscopy volume to investigate the laminar cytoarchitecture of the transient external granular layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, where granule cells coordinate a series of mitotic and migratory events. By integrating image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and deep learning approaches, we discovered and characterized anatomically complex intercellular connections bridging pairs of cerebellar granule cells throughout the EGL. Connected cells were either mitotic, migratory, or transitioning between these two cell stages, displaying a chronological continuum of proliferative and migratory events never previously observed in vivo at this resolution. This unprecedented ultra-structural characterization poses intriguing hypotheses about intercellular connectivity between developing progenitors, and its possible role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).

	<p>Introduction: Non-invasive brain stimulation seems to be beneficial for DPD patients. However, the sites used in previous studies were empirical. Exploring new stimulation locations via functional magnetic resonance imaging may improve the efficacy. Objectives: The objective was to find potential locations for non-invasive brain stimulation on the depersonalization-derealization disorder. Methods: We explored the potential brain surface regions from three pipelines: pipeline 1: activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis (five studies with 36 foci included); pipeline 2: functional connectivity analysis based on DPD-network (76 subjects included); and pipeline 3: functional connectivity analysis based on DPD regions of interest from the meta-analysis. Potential targets were the 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system coordinates for brain surface regions. Results: We identified several potential brain surface regions, including the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as potential sites. Conclusion: Our findings of the potential stimulation targets might help clinicians optimize the application of non-invasive brain stimulation therapy in individuals with DPD.</p>

	<p>Dynamic changes in the oral microbiome have gained attention due to their potential diagnostic role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, but no studies have examined the changes in oral microbiome during the acute stage of TBI using a clinically translational pig model. Crossbred piglets (4&amp;amp;ndash;5 weeks old, male) underwent either a controlled cortical impact (TBI, n = 6) or sham surgery (sham, n = 6). The oral microbiome parameters were quantified from the upper and lower gingiva, both buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth pre-surgery and 1, 3, and 7 days post-surgery (PS) using the 16S rRNA gene. Faith&amp;amp;rsquo;s phylogenetic diversity was significantly lower in the TBI piglets at 7 days PS compared to those of sham, and beta diversity at 1, 3, and 7 days PS was significantly different between TBI and sham piglets. However, no significant changes in the taxonomic composition of the oral microbiome were observed following TBI compared to sham. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential diagnostic role of the oral microbiome during the chronic stage of TBI with a larger number of subjects.</p>

	<p>The technological revolution has led to the birth of new diagnoses, such as gaming disorder. When any addiction, including this one, is associated with other mental disorders, it is considered a dual diagnosis. The objectives of this current work were to estimate the prevalence of dual diagnoses in the adolescent general population while also considering the problematic use of video games and substance addiction and assessing its psychosocial risk factors. Thus, we carried out a cross-sectional study with a sample of 397 adolescents; 16.4% presented problematic videogame use and 3% presented a dual diagnosis. Male gender increased the probability of both a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 7.119 [1.132, 44.785]; p = 0.036) and problematic video game use (OR [95% CI] = 9.85 [4.08, 23.77]; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Regarding personality, low conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness scores were predictors of a dual diagnosis and problematic videogame use, while emotional stability predicted a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 1.116 [1.030, 1.209]; p = 0.008). Regarding family dynamics, low affection and communication increased both the probability of a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 0.927 [0.891, 0.965]; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and problematic video game use (OR [95% CI] = 0.968 [0.945, 0.992]; p = 0.009). Regarding academic performance, bad school grades increased the probability of a dual diagnosis. In summary, male gender, certain personality traits, poor communication, and poor affective family dynamics should be interpreted as red flags that indicate an increased risk of a dual diagnosis in adolescents, which could require early intervention through specific detection programs.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We characterize the content and role of prognostic discussion for infants with neurologic conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this descriptive qualitative study, we prospectively enrolled infants (age &lt; 1 year) in the intensive care unit with a neurologic condition anticipated to have ≥1 family conference about prognosis or goals of care. We audiorecorded family conferences as they occurred. We used a rapid-cycle qualitative approach to identify and refine themes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty infants and 61 parents were enrolled; 68 family conferences occurred for 24 infants. The majority of infant cases (n = 23/24, 96%) and conferences (n = 64/68, 94%) included discussion of neurologic prognosis. Common infant diagnoses included prematurity (n = 12, 52%), genetic conditions (n = 9, 35%), and brain malformations (n = 7, 30%). We identified 2 themes relating to the characterization of the infant's prognosis: (1) predictions of impairment and (2) rationale for prognostic predictions. We identified 3 themes characterizing the role of prognostic discussion: (1) aligning parent and clinician understanding of infant outcome, (2) influencing decision-making, and (3) preparing for life at home. We identified 2 themes characterizing discussion of prognostic uncertainty: (1) multilayered types of uncertainty and (2) holding space for hope alongside uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this cohort of infants with neurologic conditions and their parents, we identified salient themes characterizing the content and role of discussion about neurologic outcome. Our findings highlight that prognostic discussion focuses on anticipated impairments, informs decision-making, and helps families prepare for home life. Future work should characterize whether these findings align with parent preferences for prognostic disclosure. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>NOTCH1 belongs to the NOTCH family of proteins that regulate cell fate and inflammatory responses. Somatic and germline <i>NOTCH1</i> variants have been implicated in cancer, Adams-Oliver syndrome, and cardiovascular defects. We describe 7 unrelated patients grouped by the presence of leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and heterozygous de novo gain-of-function variants in <i>NOTCH1</i>. Immunologic profiling showed upregulated CSF IP-10, a cytokine secreted downstream of NOTCH1 signaling. Autopsy revealed extensive leukoencephalopathy and microangiopathy with vascular calcifications. This evidence implicates that heterozygous gain-of-function variants in <i>NOTCH1</i> lead to a chronic central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response resulting in a calcifying microangiopathy with leukoencephalopathy<i>.</i> ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Quantification of functional recovery in a larval zebrafish model of spinal cord injury"/>
<p>New open-source software allowed measurement of trunk curvature during dark-evoked larval zebrafish movements following spinal cord transection. Motor deficits caudal to the lesion recovered incompletely, even after regeneration of spinal axons, suggesting that evaluation of function will be critical to understand restoration of circuitry in this central nervous system injury model.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Human spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by permanent loss of damaged axons, resulting in chronic disability. In contrast, zebrafish can regenerate axonal projections following central nervous system injury and re-establish synaptic contacts with distant targets; elucidation of the underlying molecular events is an important goal with translational potential for improving outcomes in SCI patients. We generated transgenic zebrafish with GFP-labeled axons and transected their spinal cords at 10 days post-fertilization. Intravital confocal microscopy revealed robust axonal regeneration following the procedure, with abundant axons bridging the transection site by 48 h post-injury. In order to analyze neurological function in this model, we developed and validated new open-source software to measure zebrafish lateral trunk curvature during propulsive and turning movements at high temporal resolution. Immediately following spinal cord transection, axial movements were dramatically decreased caudal to the lesion site, but preserved rostral to the injury, suggesting the induction of motor paralysis below the transection level. Over the subsequent 96 h, the magnitude of movements caudal to the lesion recovered to baseline, but the rate of change of truncal curvature did not fully recover, suggesting incomplete restoration of caudal strength over this time course. Quantification of both morphological and functional recovery following SCI will be important for the analysis of axonal regeneration and downstream events necessary for restoration of motor function. An extensive array of genetic and pharmacological interventions can be deployed in the larval zebrafish model to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Predicting Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson’s disease through incentive biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To evaluate if the feedback related negativity (FRN) –a neurophysiological marker of incentive processing- can be used to predict the development of impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson’s disease (PD)</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal cohort of consecutive non-demented Parkinson’s disease patients with no ICD history. We recorded FRN signals while they performed a gambling task. We calculated the mean amplitude difference between losses and gains (FRNdiff) to be used as a predictor of future ICD development. We performed prospective biannual follow-up assessments for 30 months to detect incident ICD. Finally, we evaluated how basal FRNdiff was associated to posterior development of ICD using survival models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 7, 2015 and December 16, 2016, we screened 120 patients. Among them, 94 patients performed the gambling and 92 completed the follow up. Eighteen patients developed ICD during follow up while 74 remained free of ICD. Baseline FRNdiff was greater in patients who developed ICD than in those who did not (-2.33 μV vs -0.84μV, p=0.001). No other significant baseline differences were found. The FRNdiff was significantly associated with ICD development in the survival models both when not adjusted (HR of 0.73, CI95% 0.58-0.91, p=0.006) and when controlling for dopamine replacement therapy, sex and age (HR 0.74, CI95% 0.55-0.97, p= 0.035). None of the impulsivity measures evaluated was related to ICD development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reward processing differences measured by FRN signals precede ICD development in Parkinson’s disease. This neurophysiological marker permits to identify patients with high risk of ICD development.</p>

	<p>This study investigated the quantitative distribution of cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) based on quantitative sensitivity mapping (QSM) and determined its prognostic value in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). A retrospective study was conducted on 39 hospitalized patients. Reconstructed QSM was used to calculate the cerebral SvO2 of each region of interest (ROI) in the ischemic hemisphere. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland&amp;amp;ndash;Altman analysis were conducted to define the best resolution of the distribution map. The correlation between the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions (SvO2ROI &amp;amp;lt; 0.7) and clinical scores was obtained by Spearman and power analysis. The associations between cerebral SvO2 and unfavorable prognosis were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Excellent agreement was found between the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions with a resolution of 7.18 &amp;amp;times; 7.18 &amp;amp;times; 1.6 mm3 and asymmetrically prominent cortical veins regions (ICC: 0.879 (admission), ICC: 0.906 (discharge)). The cerebral SvO2 was significantly negative with clinical scores (all |r| &amp;amp;gt; 0.3). The cerebral SvO2 and its changes at discharge were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis (OR: 0.812 and 0.866). Therefore, the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions measured by the quantitative distribution map can be used as an indicator for evaluating the early prognosis of AIS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Network States Classification based on Local Field Potential Recordings in the Awake Mouse Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent studies using intracellular recordings in awake behaving mice revealed that cortical network states, defined based on membrane potential features, modulate sensory responses and perceptual outcomes. Single-cell intracellular recordings are difficult and have low yield compared to extracellular recordings of population signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs). However, it is currently unclear how to identify these behaviorally-relevant network states from the LFP. We used simultaneous LFP and intracellular recordings in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice to design a network state classification from the LFP, the Network State Index (NSI). We used the NSI to analyze the relationship between single-cell (intracellular) and population (LFP) signals over different network states of wakefulness. We found that graded levels of population signal faithfully predicted the levels of single-cell depolarization in nonrhythmic regimes whereas, in  ([2&ndash;4 Hz]) oscillatory regimes, the graded levels of rhythmicity in the LFP mapped into a stereotypical oscillatory pattern of membrane potential. Finally, we showed that the variability of network states, beyond the occurrence of slow oscillatory activity, critically shaped the average correlations between single-cell and population signals. Application of the LFP-based NSI to mouse visual cortex data showed that this index increased with pupil size and during locomotion and had a U-shaped dependence on population firing rates. NSI-based characterization provides a ready-to-use tool to understand from LFP recordings how the modulation of local network dynamics shapes the flexibility of sensory processing during behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Measures of Spatial Orientation: Spatial Bias Analogs in Visual and Haptic Tasks</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The primary sensory modality for probing spatial orientation can vary among psychophysical tasks. In the subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, a visual stimulus is used to measure perceived vertical orientation, while a haptic stimulus is used in the subjective haptic vertical (SHV) task. Here we examined disparity in SHV and SVV task results and asked whether it could be related to biases in probing different spatial estimates by each task. Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean &plusmn; SD age, 25 &plusmn; 10 years; 19 females; 21 left handed) were recruited. The effect of a task to measure spatial orientation was calculated as the difference between SHV and SVV values, and with the head upright and tilted 20&deg; laterally. There was a task bias regardless of head position related to hand use in the haptic task but not handedness (mean head upright &plusmn; SEM: left hand, &ndash;3.7 &plusmn; 1.1&deg;; right hand, 7.9 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;). When this task bias was subtracted out, there was a similar spatial bias using each hand in the SHV task that was also comparable to the SVV task (mean head with left tilt: left hand, 3.9 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; right hand, 4.4 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; SVV, 4.9 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; mean head with right tilt: left hand, &ndash;4.6 &plusmn; 0.9&deg;; right hand, &ndash;4.6 &plusmn; 0.8&deg;; SVV, &ndash;4.7 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;). These findings show that the disparity in visual and haptic measures of spatial orientation is primarily related to a modality-specific bias, and once the effect of hand use is removed from the haptic measurements, the spatial bias becomes comparable to the visual task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Detecting Spontaneous Neural Oscillation Events in Primate Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Electrophysiological oscillations in the brain have been shown to occur as multicycle events, with onset and offset dependent on behavioral and cognitive state. To provide a baseline for state-related and task-related events, we quantified oscillation features in resting-state recordings. We developed an open-source wavelet-based tool to detect and characterize such oscillation events (OEvents) and exemplify the use of this tool in both simulations and two invasively-recorded electrophysiology datasets: one from human, and one from nonhuman primate (NHP) auditory system. After removing incidentally occurring event-related potentials (ERPs), we used OEvents to quantify oscillation features. We identified ~2 million oscillation events, classified within traditional frequency bands: , , &alpha;, &beta;, low , , and high . Oscillation events of 1&ndash;44 cycles could be identified in at least one frequency band 90% of the time in human and NHP recordings. Individual oscillation events were characterized by nonconstant frequency and amplitude. This result necessarily contrasts with prior studies which assumed frequency constancy, but is consistent with evidence from event-associated oscillations. We measured oscillation event duration, frequency span, and waveform shape. Oscillations tended to exhibit multiple cycles per event, verifiable by comparing filtered to unfiltered waveforms. In addition to the clear intraevent rhythmicity, there was also evidence of interevent rhythmicity within bands, demonstrated by finding that coefficient of variation of interval distributions and Fano factor (FF) measures differed significantly from a Poisson distribution assumption. Overall, our study provides an easy-to-use tool to study oscillation events at the single-trial level or in ongoing recordings, and demonstrates that rhythmic, multicycle oscillation events dominate auditory cortical dynamics.</p>

                The extended family is a system that promotes cohesion, togetherness, cooperation and support amongst its members. It has been a cherished tradition in most African societies from pre-colonial era to present period. The existence of this family system accounts for the longevity of ancestral traditions and heritage which is the bedrock and sustenance of most African societies. However, with the adoption of western culture, the effects of global economic meltdown and impacts of inter and intra ethnic conflicts threatens this cherished extended family tradition.. This paper explores the role relationship in kinship in selected West African societies. It adopts an exploratory approach; drawing largely from secondary data. This study posits that role relationship in kinship is an indispensable tie among Africans especially in the western region. Also most of its tenets have become resilient in solidifying the nationhood of most African societies despite acculturation. The paper concludes that notwithstanding the relative influence of modernity and urbanisation, African societies can, through embracing modern technology maintain its extended family ties even if spread over a wide geographical area.

                Background: An influential piece of literature on effective altruism insists that not-for-profit organizations (NFPs) should concentrate their investments on a few activities to maximize their social return on investment (SROI) ratio. However, this creates greater risk for an NFP than building a portfolio of investments in activities. This study investigates whether it is desirable for executives and contributors of NFPs to build a portfolio rather than maximize the expected SROI ratio, and if so, how to build one. Solving these questions will help the chief financial officers (CFOs) of NFPs, who serve as their agents, fulfill their obligations to contributors, who are their principals, and will help advisors provide better services for their contributors, their clients. Methods: Data were collected from a ranking of NFPs, then non-parametric tests were performed on this ranking and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Results: The HHI are between 2013 and 2688. The results of non-parametric tests do not deny that rank and HHI are independent of each other. Most of the NFPs’ investments in activities were in accord with their core competencies. Conclusions: It was found that successful executives build portfolios. The findings of this study should be sufficiently practical in helping NFP executives and contributors decide whether to build portfolios, and if so, how.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Avoiding costly mistakes in groups: The evolution of error management in collective decision making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alan Novaes Tump, Max Wolf, Pawel Romanczuk, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers</p>

Individuals continuously have to balance the error costs of alternative decisions. A wealth of research has studied how single individuals navigate this, showing that individuals develop response biases to avoid the more costly error. We, however, know little about the dynamics in groups facing asymmetrical error costs and when social influence amplifies either safe or risky behavior. Here, we investigate this by modeling the decision process and information flow with a drift–diffusion model extended to the social domain. In the model individuals first gather independent personal information; they then enter a social phase in which they can either decide early based on personal information, or wait for additional social information. We combined the model with an evolutionary algorithm to derive adaptive behavior. We find that under asymmetric costs, individuals in large cooperative groups do not develop response biases because such biases amplify at the collective level, triggering false information cascades. Selfish individuals, however, undermine the group’s performance for their own benefit by developing higher response biases and waiting for more information. Our results have implications for our understanding of the social dynamics in groups facing asymmetrical errors costs, such as animal groups evading predation or police officers holding a suspect at gunpoint.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Recombination-aware phylogeographic inference using the structured coalescent with ancestral recombination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fangfang Guo, Ignazio Carbone, David A. Rasmussen</p>

Movement of individuals between populations or demes is often restricted, especially between geographically isolated populations. The structured coalescent provides an elegant theoretical framework for describing how movement between populations shapes the genealogical history of sampled individuals and thereby structures genetic variation within and between populations. However, in the presence of recombination an individual may inherit different regions of their genome from different parents, resulting in a mosaic of genealogical histories across the genome, which can be represented by an Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). In this case, different genomic regions may have different ancestral histories and so different histories of movement between populations. Recombination therefore poses an additional challenge to phylogeographic methods that aim to reconstruct the movement of individuals from genealogies, although also a potential benefit in that different loci may contain additional information about movement. Here, we introduce the Structured Coalescent with Ancestral Recombination (SCAR) model, which builds on recent approximations to the structured coalescent by incorporating recombination into the ancestry of sampled individuals. The SCAR model allows us to infer how the migration history of sampled individuals varies across the genome from ARGs, and improves estimation of key population genetic parameters such as population sizes, recombination rates and migration rates. Using the SCAR model, we explore the potential and limitations of phylogeographic inference using full ARGs. We then apply the SCAR to lineages of the recombining fungus <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> sampled across the United States to explore patterns of recombination and migration across the genome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mitochondrial mRNA localization is governed by translation kinetics and spatial transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ximena G. Arceo, Elena F. Koslover, Brian M. Zid, Aidan I. Brown</p>

For many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, mRNA localizes to the mitochondrial surface co-translationally, aided by the association of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) on the nascent peptide with the mitochondrial import complex. For a subset of these co-translationally localized mRNAs, their localization is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, while others are constitutively localized. To explore the differences between these two mRNA types we developed a stochastic, quantitative model for MTS-mediated mRNA localization to mitochondria in yeast cells. This model includes translation, applying gene-specific kinetics derived from experimental data; and diffusion in the cytosol. Even though both mRNA types are co-translationally localized we found that the steady state number, or density, of ribosomes along an mRNA was insufficient to differentiate the two mRNA types. Instead, conditionally-localized mRNAs have faster translation kinetics which modulate localization in combination with changes to diffusive search kinetics across metabolic states. Our model also suggests that the MTS requires a maturation time to become competent to bind mitochondria. Our work indicates that yeast cells can regulate mRNA localization to mitochondria by controlling mitochondrial volume fraction (influencing diffusive search times) and gene translation kinetics (adjusting mRNA binding competence) without the need for mRNA-specific binding proteins. These results shed light on both global and gene-specific mechanisms that enable cells to alter mRNA localization in response to changing metabolic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling age-specific incidence of colon cancer via niche competition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Steffen Lange, Richard Mogwitz, Denis Hünniger, Anja Voß-Böhme</p>

Cancer development is a multistep process often starting with a single cell in which a number of epigenetic and genetic alterations have accumulated thus transforming it into a tumor cell. The progeny of such a single benign tumor cell expands in the tissue and can at some point progress to malignant tumor cells until a detectable tumor is formed. The dynamics from the early phase of a single cell to a detectable tumor with billions of tumor cells are complex and still not fully resolved, not even for the well-known prototype of multistage carcinogenesis, the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence of colorectal cancer. Mathematical models of such carcinogenesis are frequently tested and calibrated based on reported age-specific incidence rates of cancer, but they usually require calibration of four or more parameters due to the wide range of processes these models aim to reflect. We present a cell-based model, which focuses on the competition between wild-type and tumor cells in colonic crypts, with which we are able reproduce epidemiological incidence rates of colon cancer. Additionally, the fraction of cancerous tumors with precancerous lesions predicted by the model agree with clinical estimates. The correspondence between model and reported data suggests that the fate of tumor development is majorly determined by the early phase of tumor growth and progression long before a tumor becomes detectable. Due to the focus on the early phase of tumor development, the model has only a single fit parameter, the time scale set by an effective replacement rate of stem cells in the crypt. We find this effective rate to be considerable smaller than the actual replacement rate, which implies that the time scale is limited by the processes succeeding clonal conversion of crypts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">TreeKnit: Inferring ancestral reassortment graphs of influenza viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Barrat-Charlaix, Timothy G. Vaughan, Richard A. Neher</p>

When two influenza viruses co-infect the same cell, they can exchange genome segments in a process known as reassortment. Reassortment is an important source of genetic diversity and is known to have been involved in the emergence of most pandemic influenza strains. However, because of the difficulty in identifying reassortments events from viral sequence data, little is known about its role in the evolution of the seasonal influenza viruses. Here we introduce TreeKnit, a method that infers ancestral reassortment graphs (ARG) from two segment trees. It is based on topological differences between trees, and proceeds in a greedy fashion by finding regions that are compatible in the two trees. Using simulated genealogies with reassortments, we show that TreeKnit performs well in a wide range of settings and that it is as accurate as a more principled bayesian method, while being orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we show that it is possible to use the inferred ARG to better resolve segment trees and to construct more informative visualizations of reassortments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cattle transport network predicts endemic and epidemic foot-and-mouth disease risk on farms in Turkey</a></h4>

              
                <p>by José L. Herrera-Diestra, Michael Tildesley, Katriona Shea, Matthew J. Ferrari</p>

The structure of contact networks affects the likelihood of disease spread at the population scale and the risk of infection at any given node. Though this has been well characterized for both theoretical and empirical networks for the spread of epidemics on completely susceptible networks, the long-term impact of network structure on risk of infection with an endemic pathogen, where nodes can be infected more than once, has been less well characterized. Here, we analyze detailed records of the transportation of cattle among farms in Turkey to characterize the global and local attributes of the directed—weighted shipments network between 2007-2012. We then study the correlations between network properties and the likelihood of infection with, or exposure to, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) over the same time period using recorded outbreaks. The shipments network shows a complex combination of features (local and global) that have not been previously reported in other networks of shipments; i.e. small-worldness, scale-freeness, modular structure, among others. We find that nodes that were either infected or at high risk of infection with FMD (within one link from an infected farm) had disproportionately higher degree, were more central (eigenvector centrality and coreness), and were more likely to be net recipients of shipments compared to those that were always more than 2 links away from an infected farm. High in-degree (i.e. many shipments received) was the best univariate predictor of infection. Low in-coreness (i.e. peripheral nodes) was the best univariate predictor of nodes always more than 2 links away from an infected farm. These results are robust across the three different serotypes of FMD observed in Turkey and during periods of low-endemic prevalence and high-prevalence outbreaks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel feature selection methods for construction of accurate epigenetic clocks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adam Li, Amber Mueller, Brad English, Anthony Arena, Daniel Vera, Alice E. Kane, David A. Sinclair</p>

Epigenetic clocks allow us to accurately predict the age and future health of individuals based on the methylation status of specific CpG sites in the genome and are a powerful tool to measure the effectiveness of longevity interventions. There is a growing need for methods to efficiently construct epigenetic clocks. The most common approach is to create clocks using elastic net regression modelling of all measured CpG sites, without first identifying specific features or CpGs of interest. The addition of feature selection approaches provides the opportunity to optimise the identification of predictive CpG sites. Here, we apply novel feature selection methods and combinatorial approaches including newly adapted neural network, genetic algorithms, and ‘chained’ combinations. Human whole blood methylation data of ~470,000 CpGs was used to develop clocks that predict age with R2 correlation scores of greater than 0.73, the most predictive of which uses 35 CpG sites for a R2 correlation score of 0.87. The five most frequent sites across all clocks were modelled to build a clock with a R2 correlation score of 0.83. These two clocks are validated on two external datasets where they maintain excellent predictive accuracy. When compared with three published epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, Weidner) also applied to these validation datasets, our clocks outperformed all three models. We identified gene regulatory regions associated with selected CpG as possible targets for future aging studies. Thus, our feature selection algorithms build accurate, generalizable clocks with a low number of CpG sites, providing important tools for the field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DSCN: Double-target selection guided by CRISPR screening and network</a></h4>

Cancer is a complex disease with usually multiple disease mechanisms. Target combination is a better strategy than a single target in developing cancer therapies. However, target combinations are generally more difficult to be predicted. <i>C</i>urrent CRISPR-cas9 technology enables genome-wide screening for potential targets, but only a handful of genes have been screend as target combinations. Thus, an effective computational approach for selecting candidate target combinations is highly desirable. Selected target combinations also need to be translational between cell lines and cancer patients. We have therefore developed DSCN (double-target selection guided by CRISPR screening and network), a method that matches expression levels in patients and gene essentialities in cell lines through spectral-clustered protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In DSCN, a sub-sampling approach is developed to model first-target knockdown and its impact on the PPI network, and it also facilitates the selection of a second target. Our analysis first demonstrated a high correlation of the DSCN sub-sampling-based gene knockdown model and its predicted differential gene expressions using observed gene expression in 22 pancreatic cell lines before and after MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 inhibition (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.75). In DSCN algorithm, various scoring schemes were evaluated. The ‘diffusion-path’ method showed the most significant statistical power of differentialting known synthetic lethal (SL) versus non-SL gene pairs (<i>P</i> = 0.001) in pancreatic cancer. The superior performance of DSCN over existing network-based algorithms, such as OptiCon and VIPER, in the selection of target combinations is attributable to its ability to calculate combinations for any gene pairs, whereas other approaches focus on the combinations among optimized regulators in the network. DSCN’s computational speed is also at least ten times fast than that of other methods. Finally, in applying DSCN to predict target combinations and drug combinations for individual samples (DSCNi), DSCNi showed high correlation between target combinations predicted and real synergistic combinations (<i>P</i> = 1e-5) in pancreatic cell lines. In summary, DSCN is a highly effective computational method for the selection of target combinations.

Various stakeholders in science have put research integrity high on their agenda. Among them, research funders are prominently placed to foster research integrity by requiring that the organizations and individual researchers they support make an explicit commitment to research integrity. Moreover, funders need to adopt appropriate research integrity practices themselves. To facilitate this, we recommend that funders develop and implement a Research Integrity Promotion Plan (RIPP). This Consensus View offers a range of examples of how funders are already promoting research integrity, distills 6 core topics that funders should cover in a RIPP, and provides guidelines on how to develop and implement a RIPP. We believe that the 6 core topics we put forward will guide funders towards strengthening research integrity policy in their organization and guide the researchers and research organizations they fund.

                <p>by Zach Ladwig, Yuhua Yu, Caterina Gratton</p>

A clear understanding of how human brain networks reflect task performance has been lacking, in part due to methodological difficulties. A new study combines the temporal resolution of EEG, MRI source localization, and multivariate modeling to address this need.

This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology that combines the millisecond temporal resolution of EEG with MRI-based source localization and multivariate modeling to track dynamic task representations in human brain networks throughout a trial.

                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used in the macrolide-based treatment. Twelve (10.4%) of NTM were macrolide resistant, with 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM having mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM were resistant to rifampicin, with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene.   Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘Science by consensus’ impedes scientific creativity and progress: An alternative to funding biomedical research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The very low success rates of grant applications to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are highly detrimental to the progress of science and the careers of scientists. The peer review process that evaluates proposals has been claimed arbitrarily to be the best there is. This consensus system, however, has never been evaluated scientifically against an alternative. Here we delineate the 15 major problems with the peer review process, and challenge the Science Advisor to the President, and the leadership of NIH, NSF, and the U.S. Academy of Sciences to refute each of these criticisms. We call for the implementation of more equitable alternatives that will not constrain the progress of science. We propose a system that will fund 80,000 principal investigators, including young scientists, with just half the current NIH budget, three-fold more than the current number of grants, and that will forego the cumbersome, expensive, and counterproductive peer review stage. Further, we propose that the success of the two methods over 5–10 years be compared scientifically.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rare inherited missense variants in <i>SLC32A1,</i> the gene that encodes the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), have recently been shown to cause genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. We aimed to clarify if <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> can also cause epilepsy with impaired neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using exome sequencing, we identified four individuals with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i>. To assess causality, we performed functional evaluation of the identified variants in a murine neuronal cell culture model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main phenotype comprises moderate to severe intellectual disability, infantile onset epilepsy within the first 18 months of life and a choreiform, dystonic or dyskinetic movement disorder. <i>In silico</i> modeling and functional analyses reveal that three of these variants, which are located in helices that line the putative GABA transport pathway, result in reduced quantal size, consistent with impaired filling of synaptic vesicles with GABA. The fourth variant, located in the VGAT N-terminus, does not affect quantal size, but increases presynaptic release probability, leading to more severe synaptic depression during high frequency stimulation. Thus, variants in VGAT can impair GABAergic neurotransmission via at least two mechanisms, by affecting synaptic vesicle filling and by altering synaptic short-term plasticity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work establishes <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> as a novel cause of a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The mechanistic role of neutrophil lymphocyte ratio perturbations in the leading non communicable lifestyle diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Inflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Inflammatory responses are indispensable for pathogen control and tissue repair, but they also cause collateral damage. A chronically activated immune system and the resultant immune dysregulation mediated inflammatory surge may cause multiple negative effects, requiring tight regulation and dampening of the immune response to minimize host injury.  While chronic diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, the mechanistic relationship of neutrophils and lymphocytes to inflammation and its correlation with the clinical outcomes is yet to be elucidated. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easy-to-measure laboratory marker used to assess systemic inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms of NLR perturbations in chronic diseases is crucial for risk stratification, early intervention, and finding novel therapeutic targets. We investigated the correlation between NLR and prevalent chronic conditions as a measure of systemic inflammation. In addition to predicting the risk of impending chronic conditions, NLR may also provide insight into their progression. This review summarizes the mechanisms of NLR perturbations at cellular and molecular levels, and the key inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the progression of chronic diseases. We have also explored preclinical studies investigating these pathways and the effect of quelling inflammation in chronic disease as reported by a few in vitro, in vivo studies, and clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neurovascular coupling: motive unknown</a></h4>

              
                In the brain, increases in neural activity drive changes in local blood flow via neurovascular coupling. The common explanation for increased blood flow (known as functional hyperemia) is that it supplies the metabolic needs of active neurons. However, there is a large body of evidence that is inconsistent with this idea. Baseline blood flow is adequate to supply oxygen needs even with elevated neural activity. Neurovascular coupling is irregular, absent, or inverted in many brain regions, behavioral states, and conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Prefrontal cortex as a key node in arousal circuitry</a></h4>

              
                The role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the mechanism of consciousness is a matter of active debate. Most theoretical and empirical investigations have focused on whether the PFC is critical for the content of consciousness (i.e., the qualitative aspects of conscious experience). However, there is emerging evidence that, in addition to its well-established roles in cognition, the PFC is a key regulator of the level of consciousness (i.e., the global state of arousal). In this opinion article we review recent data supporting the hypothesis that the medial PFC is a critical node in arousal-promoting networks.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Enhanced excitability of the hippocampal CA2 region and its contribution to seizure activity in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Whitebirch et al. find increased intrinsic excitability and net synaptic excitation of CA2 PCs in hippocampal slices from epileptic mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of CA2 PCs in vivo reduces the frequency of spontaneous recurring seizures. Together, these data suggest that pathological hyperexcitability in CA2 circuitry may contribute to seizure activity in epilepsy.

                Complex systems are challenging to understand, especially when they defy manipulative experiments for practical or ethical reasons. Several fields have developed parallel approaches to infer causal relations from observational time series. Yet, these methods are easy to misunderstand and often controversial. Here, we provide an accessible and critical review of three statistical causal discovery approaches (pairwise correlation, Granger causality, and state space reconstruction), using examples inspired by ecological processes. For each approach, we ask what it tests for, what causal statement it might imply, and when it could lead us astray. We devise new ways of visualizing key concepts, describe some novel pathologies of existing methods, and point out how so-called ‘model-free’ causality tests are not assumption-free. We hope that our synthesis will facilitate thoughtful application of methods, promote communication across different fields, and encourage explicit statements of assumptions. A video walkthrough is available (Video 1 or <a href="https://youtu.be/AIV0ttQrjK8">https://youtu.be/AIV0ttQrjK8</a>).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HLJ1 amplifies endotoxin-induced sepsis severity by promoting IL-12 heterodimerization in macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Heat shock protein (HSP) 40 has emerged as a key factor in both innate and adaptive immunity, whereas the role of HLJ1, a molecular chaperone in HSP40 family, in modulating endotoxin-induced sepsis severity is still unclear. During LPS-induced endotoxic shock, HLJ1 knockout mice shows reduced organ injury and IFN-γ-dependent mortality. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterize mouse liver nonparenchymal cell populations under LPS stimulation, and show that HLJ1 deletion affected IFN-γ-related gene signatures in distinct immune cell clusters. In CLP models, HLJ1 deletion reduces IFN-γ expression and sepsis mortality rate when mice are treated with antibiotics. HLJ1 deficiency also leads to reduced serum levels of IL-12 in LPS-treated mice, contributing to dampened production of IFN-γ in natural killer cells but not CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and subsequently to improved survival rate. Adoptive transfer of HLJ1-deleted macrophages into LPS-treated mice results in reduced IL-12 and IFN-γ levels and protects the mice from IFN-γ-dependent mortality. In the context of molecular mechanisms, HLJ1 is an LPS-inducible protein in macrophages and converts misfolded IL-12p35 homodimers to monomers, which maintains bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimerization and secretion. This study suggests HLJ1 causes IFN-γ-dependent septic lethality by promoting IL-12 heterodimerization, and targeting HLJ1 has therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases involving activated IL-12/IFN-γ axis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">EHMT2 methyltransferase governs cell identity in the lung and is required for KRASG12D tumor development and propagation</a></h4>

              
                Lung development, integrity and repair rely on precise Wnt signaling, which is corrupted in diverse diseases, including cancer. Here, we discover that EHMT2 methyltransferase regulates Wnt signaling in the lung by controlling the transcriptional activity of chromatin-bound β-catenin, through a non-histone substrate in mouse lung. Inhibition of EHMT2 induces transcriptional, morphologic, and molecular changes consistent with alveolar type 2 (AT2) lineage commitment. Mechanistically, EHMT2 activity functions to support regenerative properties of Kras<sup>G12D</sup> tumors and normal AT2 cells - the predominant cell of origin of this cancer. Consequently, EHMT2 inhibition prevents <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i> lung adenocarcinoma tumor formation and propagation and disrupts normal AT2 cell differentiation. Consistent with these findings, low gene <i>EHMT2</i> expression in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with enhanced AT2 gene expression and improved prognosis. These data reveal EHMT2 as a critical regulator of Wnt signaling, implicating Ehmt2 as a potential target in lung cancer and other AT2-mediated lung pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global variation in force-of-infection trends for human Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis</a></h4>

              
                Infection by <i>Taenia solium</i> poses a major burden across endemic countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2021–2030 Neglected Tropical Diseases roadmap has proposed that 30% of endemic countries achieve intensified <i>T. solium</i> control in hyperendemic areas by 2030. Understanding geographical variation in age-prevalence profiles and force-of-infection (FoI) estimates will inform intervention designs across settings. Human taeniasis (HTT) and human cysticercosis (HCC) age-prevalence data from 16 studies in Latin America, Africa, and Asia were extracted through a systematic review. Catalytic models, incorporating diagnostic performance uncertainty, were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods, to estimate rates of antibody (Ab)-seroconversion, infection acquisition and Ab-seroreversion or infection loss. HCC FoI and Ab-seroreversion rates were also estimated across 23 departments in Colombia from 28,100 individuals. Across settings, there was extensive variation in all-ages seroprevalence. Evidence for Ab-seroreversion or infection loss was found in most settings for both HTT and HCC and for HCC Ab-seroreversion in Colombia. The average duration until humans became Ab-seropositive/infected decreased as all-age (sero)prevalence increased. There was no clear relationship between the average duration humans remain Ab-seropositive and all-age seroprevalence. Marked geographical heterogeneity in <i>T. solium</i> transmission rates indicate the need for setting-specific intervention strategies to achieve the WHO goals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular dissection of condensin II-mediated chromosome assembly using in vitro assays</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrates, condensin I and condensin II cooperate to assemble rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis. Although the mechanism of action and regulation of condensin I have been studied extensively, our corresponding knowledge of condensin II remains very limited. By introducing recombinant condensin II complexes into <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts, we dissect the roles of its individual subunits in chromosome assembly. We find that one of two HEAT subunits, CAP-D3, plays a crucial role in condensin II-mediated assembly of chromosome axes whereas the other HEAT subunit, CAP-G2, has a very strong negative impact on this process. The SMC ATPase and the basic amino acid clusters of the kleisin subunit CAP-H2 are essential for this process. Deletion of the C-terminal tail of CAP-D3 increases the ability of condensin II to assemble chromosomes and further exposes a hidden function of CAP-G2 in the lateral compaction of chromosomes. Taken together, our results uncover a multilayered regulatory mechanism unique to condensin II, and provide profound implications for the evolution of condensin II.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in the impact of electronic nicotine vapor on corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area</a></h4>

              
                Nicotine engages dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to encode reward and drive the development of nicotine addiction, however how nicotine selectively alters other VTA populations remains to be determined. Here, we used male and female CRF1-GFP mice and nicotine vapor exposure to examine the effects of nicotine in VTA corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF1) neurons. We use immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology to examine neuronal activity, excitability, and inhibitory signaling. We found that VTA CRF1 neurons are mainly dopaminergic and project to the nucleus accumbens (VTA-NAcCRF1 neurons). VTA-NAcCRF1 neurons show greater phasic inhibition in naive females and greater focal nicotine-induced increases in firing in naive males. Following acute nicotine vapor exposure, phasic inhibition was not altered, but focal nicotine-induced tonic inhibition was enhanced in females and diminished in males. Acute nicotine vapor exposure did not affect firing in VTA-NAcCRF1 neurons, but females showed lower baseline firing and higher focal nicotine-induced firing. Activity (cFos) was increased in the CRF1 dopaminergic VTA population in both sexes, but with greater increases in females. Following chronic nicotine vapor exposure, both sexes displayed reduced basal phasic inhibition and the sex difference in tonic inhibition following acute vapor exposure was no longer observed. Additionally, activity of the CRF1 dopaminergic VTA population was no longer elevated in either sex. These findings reveal sex- and exposure-dependent changes in mesolimbic VTA-NAc CRF1 neuronal activity, inhibitory signaling, and nicotine sensitivity following nicotine vapor exposure. These changes potentially contribute to nicotine-dependent behaviors and the intersection between stress, anxiety, and addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">β1-adrenergic receptor on pyramidal neurons of mPFC regulates METH-preferred behaviors in METH-sired male mice</a></h4>

              
                As a highly addictive psychostimulant drug, paternal methamphetamine (METH) exposure enhances the risk of developing addiction to drugs in descendants, however the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region that implicated in susceptibility to drugs. Here, male adult mice were exposed to METH for 30 days, followed by mating with naive female mice to create the first-generation (F1) mice. In METH-sired mice, baseline levels of c-Fos were decreased but {beta}1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) were increased in mPFC by paternal METH exposure. Trained with subthreshold-dosed administration of METH, METH-sired mice exhibited significant METH-preferred behaviors, accompanied with higher levels of c-Fos, ADRB1 and dendritic spines density in mPFC. Importantly, local blocking ADRB1 activity or specific knockdown of ADRB1 on excitatory neurons of mPFC, both efficiently inhibited METH-preferred behaviors in METH-sired mice. In parallel, levels of p-ERK1/2 and {Delta}FosB, as well as dendritic spine density were reduced by knocking-down mPFC ADRB1 in METH-sired mice. Collectively, these findings suggested that targeting ADRB1 signals in mPFC may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing drug addiction, particularly in progeny with a history of paternal drugs exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARS-CoV-2 Airway Infection Results in Time-dependent Sensory Abnormalities in a Hamster Model</a></h4>

              
                Despite being largely confined to the airways, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with sensory abnormalities that manifest in both acute and long-lasting phenotypes. To gain insight on the molecular basis of these sensory abnormalities, we used the golden hamster infection model to characterize the effects of SARS-CoV-2 versus Influenza A virus (IAV) infection on the sensory nervous system. Efforts to detect the presence of virus in the cervical/thoracic spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative PCR and RNAscope uniquely within the first 24 hours of infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters demonstrated mechanical hypersensitivity during acute infection; intriguingly, this hypersensitivity was milder, but prolonged when compared to IAV-infected hamsters. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of thoracic DRGs from acute infection revealed predominantly neuron-biased signaling perturbations in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals as opposed to type I interferon signaling in tissue derived from IAV-infected animals. RNA-seq of 31dpi thoracic DRGs from SARS-CoV-2-infected animals highlighted a uniquely neuropathic transcriptomic landscape, which was consistent with substantial SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanical hypersensitivity at 28dpi. Ontology analysis of 1, 4, and 30dpi RNA-seq revealed novel targets for pain management, such as ILF3. Meta-analysis of all SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq timepoints against preclinical pain model datasets highlighted both conserved and unique pro-nociceptive gene expression changes following infection. Overall, this work elucidates novel transcriptomic signatures triggered by SARS-CoV-2 that may underlie both short- and long-term sensory abnormalities while also highlighting several therapeutic targets for alleviation of infection-induced hypersensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The impact of alpha-synuclein aggregates on blood-brain barrier integrity in the presence of neurovascular unit cells</a></h4>

              
                The role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is to control trafficking of biomolecules and protect the brain. This function can be compromised by pathological conditions. Parkinsonprimes disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates (alphaSN-AGs) such as oligomers and fibrils, which contribute to disease progression and severity. Here we study how alphaSN-AGs affect the BBB in in vitro co-culturing models consisting of human brain endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells alone and co-cultured with astrocytes and neurons/glial cells. When cultivated on their own, hCMEC/D3 cells were compromised by alphaSN-AGs, which decreased cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, wound healing activity, TEER and permeability parameters, as well as increased the levels of ROS and NO. Co-culturing of these cells with activated microglia also increased BBB impairment according to TEER and systemic immune cell transmigration assays. In contrast, hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with astrocytes or dopaminergic neurons or simultaneously treated with their conditioned media showed increased resistance against alphaSN-AGs. Our work demonstrates the complex relationship between members of the neurovascular unit (NVU) (perivascular astrocytes, neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells), alphaSN-AGs and BBB.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beat encoding at mistuned octaves within single sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Beats are periodic amplitude modulations resulting from the superposition of two periodic signals of different frequencies. Psychophysical experiments by Georg Simon Ohm, Hermann Helmholtz, and others from the 19th century demonstrate that beats are not only perceived for two close-by frequencies but also at mistuned octaves. However, the physiological mechanisms of this percept are still debated. Motivated by a field study, in which we observed the behavioral relevance of beats at high difference frequencies, we here study the beat encoding over a wide range of difference frequencies in the electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. The activity of P-unit electroreceptor afferents, that share many properties with mammalian auditory fibers, follows a repetitive pattern with slow modulations of their firing rate reoccurring around multiples of the frequency of the carrier signal. By mathematical reasoning and supported by simulations of modified integrate-and-fire models we conclude that neither Hilbert transform, squaring, harmonics of the carrier, nor a threshold operation are sufficient to extract slow beats around the octave. Raising the thresholded signal to a power of three, however, is sufficient to explain the repetitive P-unit responses. Since the threshold-nonlinearity of the afferent's spike generator could be ruled out, it is most likely the transfer function of the electroreceptor synapse that implements such a non-linearity. In the auditory system the hair-cell synapse is known to act as a smooth threshold operation. We thus conclude that this mechanism within each auditory fiber contributes to the perception of beats at mistuned octaves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetically encoded sensors for measuring histamine release both in vitro and in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Histamine (HA) is a key biogenic monoamine involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes in both the central nervous system and the periphery. Because the ability to directly measure extracellular HA in real-time will provide important insights into the functional role of HA in complex circuits under a variety of conditions, we developed a series of genetically encoded G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) HA (GRABHA) sensors. These sensors produce a robust increase in fluorescence upon HA application, with good photostability, sub-second kinetics, nanomolar affinity, and high specificity. Using these GRABHA sensors, we measured electrical stimulation-evoked HA release in acute brain slices with high spatiotemporal resolution. Moreover, we recorded HA release in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and in the medial prefrontal cortex during the sleep-wake cycle in freely moving mice, finding distinct patterns of HA release in these specific brain regions. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results show that our GRABHA sensors have high sensitivity and specificity for measuring extracellular HA, thus providing a robust new set of tools for examining the role of HA signaling in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why does the error negativity peak higher when accuracy is emphasised over speed? The impact of noise and single-trial latency variability challenges traditional interpretations</a></h4>

              
                Understanding human error processing is a highly relevant interdisciplinary goal. More than 30 years of research in this field have established the error negativity (Ne) as a fundamental electrophysiological marker of various types of erroneous decisions (e.g. perceptual, economic) and related clinically relevant variations. A common finding is that the Ne is more pronounced when participants are instructed to focus on response accuracy rather than response speed, an observation that has been interpreted as reflecting more thorough error processing. We challenge this wide-spread interpretation by demonstrating that when controlling for the level of non-event-related noise in the participant-average waveform and for single-trial peak latency variability, the significant speed-accuracy difference in the participant-average waveform vanishes. This suggests that the previously reported Ne differences may be mostly attributable to a more precise alignment of neuro-cognitive processes and not (only) to more intense error processing under accuracy instructions, opening up novel perspectives on previous findings.

                Cortical depth-dependent functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI), also known as layer-fMRI, has the potential to capture directional neural information flow of brain computations within and across large-scale cortical brain networks. E.g., layer-fMRI can differentiate feedforward and feedback cortical input in hierarchically organized brain networks. Recent advancements in 3D-EPI sampling approaches and MR contrast generation strategies have allowed proof-of-principle studies showing that layer-fMRI can provide sufficient data quality for capturing laminar changes in functional connectivity. These studies have however not shown how reliable the signal is and how repeatable the respective results are. It is especially unclear whether whole-brain layer-fMRI functional connectivity protocols are widely applicable across common neuroscience-driven analysis approaches. Moreover, there are no established preprocessing fMRI methods that are optimized to work for whole-brain layer-fMRI datasets. In this work, we aimed to serve the field of layer-fMRI and build tools for future routine whole-brain layer-fMRI in application-based neuroscience research. We have developed publicly available sequences, acquisition protocols, and processing pipelines for whole-brain layer-fMRI. These protocols are validated across 60 hours of scanning in nine participants. Specifically, we identified and exploited methodological advancements for maximizing tSNR efficiency and test-retest reliability. We are sharing an extensive multi-modal whole-brain layer-fMRI dataset (20 scan hours of movie-watching in a single participant) for the purpose of benchmarking future method developments: The Kenshu dataset. With this dataset, we are also exemplifying the usefulness of whole brain layer-fMRI for commonly applied analysis approaches in modern cognitive neuroscience fMRI studies. This includes connectivity analyses, representational similarity matrix estimations, general linear model analyses, principal component analysis clustering, etc. We believe that this work paves the road for future routine measurements of directional functional connectivity across the entire brain.

                If a congenitally blind person learns to distinguish between a cube and a sphere by touch, would they immediately recognise these objects by sight if their vision is restored? This question, posed by Molyneux in 1688, has puzzled philosophers and scientists. We overcame ethical and practical difficulties in the study of cross-modal recognition by using inexperienced chicks. We hatched chicks in darkness, exposed them to tactile smooth vs. bumpy stimuli in darkness and then tested them in a visual recognition task. At first sight, chicks previously exposed to smooth stimuli approached the smooth stimulus significantly more than those exposed to the bumpy stimuli. This shows that cross-modal recognition does not require multi-modal experience. At least in precocial species, supra-modal brain areas already function at birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decision-making in dynamic, continuously evolving environments: quantifying the flexibility of human choice</a></h4>

              
                During perceptual decision-making tasks, centroparietal EEG potentials report an evidence accumulation-to-bound process that is time locked to trial onset. However, decisions in real-world environments are rarely confined to discrete trials; they instead unfold continuously, with accumulation of time-varying evidence being recency-weighted towards its immediate past. Confronted with time-varying stimuli, humans can appropriately adapt their weighting of recent evidence according to the statistics of the environment. The neural mechanisms supporting this adaptation currently remain unclear. Here, we show that humans' ability to adapt evidence weighting to different sensory environments is reflected in changes in centroparietal EEG potentials. We use a novel continuous task design to show that the Centroparietal Positivity (CPP) becomes more sensitive to fluctuations in sensory evidence when large shifts in evidence are less frequent, and is primarily sensitive to fluctuations in decision-relevant (not decision-irrelevant) sensory input. A complementary triphasic component over parietal cortex encodes the sum of recently accumulated sensory evidence, and its magnitude covaries with the duration over which different individuals integrate sensory evidence. Our findings reveal how adaptations in centroparietal responses reflect flexibility in evidence accumulation to the statistics of dynamic sensory environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans rely more on talker identity than temporal coherence in an audiovisual selective attention task using speech-like stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Audiovisual integration of speech can benefit the listener by not only improving comprehension of what a talker is saying but also helping a listener pick a particular talker's voice out of a mix of sounds. Binding, an early integration of auditory and visual streams that helps an observer allocate attention to a combined audiovisual object, is likely involved in audiovisual speech processing. Although temporal coherence of stimulus features across sensory modalities has been implicated as an important cue for non-speech stimuli (Maddox et al, 2015), the specific cues that drive binding in speech are not fully understood due to the challenges of studying binding in natural stimuli. Here we used speech-like artificial stimuli that allowed us to isolate three potential contributors to binding: temporal coherence (are the face and the voice changing synchronously?), articulatory correspondence (do visual faces represent the correct phones?), and talker congruence (do the face and voice come from the same person?). In a trio of experiments, we examined the relative contributions of each of these cues. Normal hearing listeners performed a dual detection task in which they were instructed to respond to events in a target auditory stream and a visual stream while ignoring events in a distractor auditory stream. We found that viewing the face of a talker who matched the attended voice (i.e., talker congruence) offered a performance benefit. Importantly, we found no effect of temporal coherence on performance in this task, a result that prompts an important recontextualization of previous findings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-associated Transcriptional Alterations in the Retinal of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Current approaches for studying pathologic changes in the retina associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remain heterogeneous, limiting the use of retinal amyloid-beta as a viable biomarker for AD. Transcriptomic profiling of the retina has provided cell-specific insight into AD progression in the brain yet is lacking in the retina. In this study, we implemented a non-biased approach through next-generation sequencing to profile frozen archived retinal tissues from autopsy/pathologically confirmed AD and non-diagnosed cases (NonAD). A total of 37,211 nuclei were isolated from frozen retinal tissue punches originating from AD, and 31,326 were isolated from non-diagnosed cases. Gene expression patterns specific to the retinal region and major retinal cell types were represented in both tissue groups. AD-associated genes were differentially expressed in AD retinal glial cells, including microglia. A greater percentage of microglial nuclei from AD retinal nuclei expressed TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein (TYROBP) compared to nonAD retinal nuclei. However, compared to microglia from single retinal cell datasets from elderly non-diseased individuals, TYROBP expression is highly expressed in the single cell data set, indicating TYROBP transcripts reside within the cytoplasm. However, other AD-associated genes were differentially expressed in AD nuclei such as DOCK2, PICALM, and PLCG2 compared to non-diseased single-cell microglia, implicating a role of these genes in the AD retina. To summarize, we extracted a high number of nuclei from frozen retinal tissue that retain specific gene markers for cell classification and highlighted candidate AD-associated genes in retinal microglia that may be viable in future AD retinal studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Egocentric value maps of the near-body environment</a></h4>

              
                Body-part centric response fields are pervasive: they are observed in single neurons, fMRI, EEG, and multiple behavioural measures. This prevalence across scales and measures makes them excellent candidates for studying systems-level neuroscience. Nonetheless, they remain poorly understood because we lack a unifying formal explanation of their origins and role in wider brain function. Here, we provide such explanation. We use reinforcement learning to analytically explain the existence of body-part centric receptive fields, also known as peripersonal field. We then simulate multiple experimental findings considered foundational in the peripersonal space literature. Our results demonstrate that peripersonal fields naturally arise from two simple and plausible assumptions about living agents: 1) they experience reward when they contact objects in the environment, and 2) they act to maximise reward. These simple assumptions are enough to explain empirical findings on stimulus kinematics, tool use, valence, and network-architecture. Our explanation provides further insight. First, it offers multiple empirically testable predictions. Second, it offers a formal description of the notion that the world-agent state is encoded in parieto-premotor cortices, using motor primitives: peripersonal fields provide building blocks that together create a short-term model of the world near the agent in terms of its future states; a successor representation. This short-term, close-range egocentric peripersonal map is analogous to the long-term, long-range allocentric spatial map of place and grid cells, which underlie locomotion and navigation to reach distant objects. Together, these allocentric and egocentric maps allow efficient interactions with a changing environment across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A biologically plausible dynamic deep network for recognizing structure from motion and biological motion</a></h4>

              
                A breakthrough in the understanding of dynamic 3D shape recognition was the discovery that our visual system can extract 3D shape from inputs having only sparse motion cues such as (i) point light displays and (ii) random dot displays representing rotating 3D shapes - phenomena named as biological motion (BM) processing and structure from motion (SFM) respectively. Previous psychological and computational modeling studies viewed these two as separate phenomena and could not fully identify the shared visual processing mechanisms underlying the two phenomena. Using a series of simulation studies, we describe the operations of a dynamic deep network model to explain the mechanisms underlying both SFM and BM processing. In simulation-1, the proposed Structure from Motion Network (SFMNW) is trained using displays of 5 rotating surfaces (cylinder, cone, ellipsoid, sphere and helix) and tested on its shape recognition performance under a variety of conditions: (i) varying dot density, (ii) eliminating local feature stability by introducing a finite dot lifetime, (iii) orienting shapes, (iv) occluding boundaries and intrinsic surfaces (v) embedding shape in static and dynamic noise backgrounds. Our results indicate that smaller dot density of rotating shape, oriented shapes, occluding boundaries, and dynamic noise backgrounds reduced the model's performance whereas eliminating local feature stability, occluding intrinsic boundaries, and static noise backgrounds had little effect on shape recognition, suggesting that the motion of high curvature regions like shape boundaries provide strong cues in shape recognition. In simulation-2, the proposed Biological Motion Network (BMNW) is trained using 6 point-light actions (crawl, cycle, walk, jump, wave, and salute) and tested its action recognition performance on various conditions: (i) inverted (ii) scrambled (iii) tilted (iv) masked (v) actions, embedded in static and dynamic noise backgrounds. Model performance dropped significantly for the presentation of inverted and tilted actions. On the other hand, better accuracy was attained in distinguishing scrambled, masked actions, performed under static and dynamic noise backgrounds, suggesting that critical joint movements and their movement pattern generated in the course of action (actor configuration) play a key role in action recognition performance. We also presented the above two models with mixed stimuli (a point light actions embedded in rotating shapes), and achieved significantly high accuracies. Based on the above results we hypothesize that visual motion circuitry supporting robust SFM processing is also involved in the BM processing. The proposed models provide new insights into the relationships between the two visual motion phenomena viz., SFM and BM processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expression of complexes I,II and IV decreased in noise-injured SGNs, mediating degeneration of SGNs</a></h4>

              
                Noise-induced hearing impairment can mediate delayed injury of spiral neurons (SGNs), resulting in degeneration of nerve fibers, synaptic degeneration and even death of SGNs. We believe that delayed injury is related to mitochondrial energy metabolism disorders. Therefore, we investigated ATP and the electron transport chain (ETC) in rat SGNs after noise injury and found that with prolonged injury time, ATP synthesis and the expression of complexes II and IV decreased, indicating the functional decline of the ETC. The maintenance of ETC function is related to subunit import and assembly of the complex. The disulfide relay mechanism controlled by the apoptosis inducing factor/coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 4 (AIF/CHCHD4) pathway can regulate mitochondrial protein import. The results showed that AIF expression in SGNs decreased after noise exposure, indicating that noise damage to SGNs can restore intramitochondrial protein input by downregulating the AIF/CHCHD4 pathway, hindering ETC function; insufficient ETC function is a possible reason for the delayed injury of SGNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A premotor microcircuit to generate behavior-specific muscle activation patterns in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Animals can use a common set of muscles and motor neurons (MNs) to generate diverse locomotor behaviors, but how this is accomplished remains poorly understood. Previously, we characterized the muscle activity patterns for Drosophila larval forward and backward locomotion and found that ventral oblique (VO) muscles become active earlier in backward than in forward locomotion (Zarin et al. 2019). Here, we describe how premotor circuits generate differential activation timing of VO muscles. We identify inhibitory (A06c) and excitatory (A27h) premotor neurons (PMNs) with the greatest number of synapses with VO MNs. Strikingly, A06c is a bi-modal PMN that fires before and after VO MNs in forward locomotion but fires only after MNs in backward locomotion. Further, A27h is a forward-dedicated PMN active only in forward locomotion. These two PMNs interconnect with another forward-dedicated excitatory PMN (A18b3), to create feedforward inhibitory microcircuits that define the activity window for VO MNs/muscles, producing precise VO muscle patterns underlying forward locomotion. Silencing A06c, A27h or A18b3 PMN results in premature VO muscle activation in forward locomotion, resembling early VO activation in backward locomotion. Our results identify PMN micro-circuits that produce unique MN/muscle activity patterns to create behavior-specific motor output.

	<p>Many studies have focused on navigation, spatial skills, and the olfactory system in comparative models, including those concerning the relationship between them and physical activity. Although the results are often in contrast with each other, it is assumed that physical activity can affect cognition in different ways&amp;amp;mdash;both indirectly and through a certain influence on some brain structures. In contrast, there is little research that focuses on the relationship between spatial abilities and olfactory abilities in humans. This research aimed to evaluate and compare the performance in working memory tasks of athletes and non-athletes who require good visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial navigation, olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;spatial navigation, and olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;semantic skills. The study involved 236 participants (83 athletes) between the ages of 18 and 40. All subjects were matched by age or sex. The standard Corsi Block Tapping Test (CBTT) was administrated to investigate the visual-spatial memory. Olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;spatial navigation and olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;semantic skills were assessed with two modified versions of CBTT: Olfactory CBTT (OCBTT) and Semantic&amp;amp;ndash;Olfactory CBTT (SOCBTT) respectively. The results show differences between the CORSI conditions in direction of a poor performance for athletes. A gender effect in favor of men was also found, particularly in the classic version of the CBTT. Both groups performed better in the classic version of the CBTT than OCBTT and SOCBTT. The mean of SOCBTT results is markedly lower, perhaps due to the different information processing systems needed to perform this kind of task. It is possible to explain how sports practice can affect tasks that require spatial skills and olfactory perception differently, thus supporting new hypotheses and opening new scientific horizons.</p>

	<p>New technologies, such as fiber photometry, can overcome long-standing methodological limitations and promote a better understanding of neuronal mechanisms. This study, for the first time, aimed at employing the newly available dopamine indicator (GRABDA2m) in combination with this novel imaging technique. Here, we present a detailed methodological roadmap leading to longitudinal repetitive transmitter release monitoring in in vivo freely moving animals and provide proof-of-concept data. This novel approach enables a fresh look at dopamine release patterns in the nucleus accumbens, following the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) DBS in a rodent model. Our results suggest reliable readouts of dopamine levels over at least 14 days of DBS-induced photometric measurements. We show that mfb-DBS can elicit an increased dopamine response during stimulation (5 s and 20 s DBS) compared to its baseline dopamine activity state, reaching its maximum peak amplitude in about 1 s and then recovering back after stimulation. The effect of different DBS pulse widths (PWs) also suggests a potential differential effect on this neurotransmitter response, but future studies would need to verify this. Using the described approach, we aim to gain insights into the differences between pathological and healthy models and to elucidate more exhaustively the mechanisms under which DBS exerts its therapeutic action.</p>

	<p>With discoveries of brain and spinal cord mechanisms that control gait, and disrupt gait coordination after disease or injury, and that respond to motor training for those with neurological disease or injury, there is greater ability to construct more efficacious gait coordination training paradigms. Therefore, it is critical in these contemporary times, to use the most precise, sensitive, homogeneous (i.e., domain-specific), and comprehensive measures available to assess gait coordination, dyscoordination, and changes in response to treatment. Gait coordination is defined as the simultaneous performance of the spatial and temporal components of gait. While kinematic gait measures are considered the gold standard, the equipment and analysis cost and time preclude their use in most clinics. At the same time, observational gait coordination scales can be considered. Two independent groups identified the Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool (G.A.I.T.) as the most suitable scale for both research and clinical practice, compared to other observational gait scales, since it has been proven to be valid, reliable, sensitive to change, homogeneous, and comprehensive. The G.A.I.T. has shown strong reliability, validity, and sensitive precision for those with stroke or multiple sclerosis (MS). The G.A.I.T. has been translated into four languages (English, Spanish, Taiwanese, and Portuguese (translation is complete, but not yet published)), and is in use in at least 10 countries. As a contribution to the field, and in view of the evidence for continued usefulness and international use for the G.A.I.T. measure, we have provided this update, as well as an open access copy of the measure for use in clinical practice and research, as well as directions for administering the G.A.I.T.</p>

	<p>Self-enhancement (SE) is often overlooked as a fundamental cognitive ability mediated via the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Here, we present research that establishes the relationship between the PFC, SE, and the potential evolved beneficial mechanisms. Specifically, we believe there is now enough evidence to speculate that SE exists to provide significant benefits and should be considered a normal aspect of the self. Whatever the metabolic or social cost, the upside of SE is great enough that it is a core and fundamental psychological construct. Furthermore, though entirely theoretical, we suggest that a critical reason the PFC has evolved so significantly in Homo sapiens is to, in part, sustain SE. We, therefore, elaborate on its proximate and ultimate mechanisms.</p>

	<p>While naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, better represent the complexity of the real world and are perhaps crucial to understanding the dynamics of emotion processing, there is limited research on emotions with naturalistic stimuli. There is a need to understand the temporal dynamics of emotion processing and their relationship to different dimensions of emotion experience. In addition, there is a need to understand the dynamics of functional connectivity underlying different emotional experiences that occur during or prior to such experiences. To address these questions, we recorded the EEG of participants and asked them to mark the temporal location of their emotional experience as they watched a video. We also obtained self-assessment ratings for emotional multimedia stimuli. We calculated dynamic functional the connectivity (DFC) patterns in all the frequency bands, including information about hubs in the network. The change in functional networks was quantified in terms of temporal variability, which was then used in regression analysis to evaluate whether temporal variability in DFC (tvDFC) could predict different dimensions of emotional experience. We observed that the connectivity patterns in the upper beta band could differentiate emotion categories better during or prior to the reported emotional experience. The temporal variability in functional connectivity dynamics is primarily related to emotional arousal followed by dominance. The hubs in the functional networks were found across the right frontal and bilateral parietal lobes, which have been reported to facilitate affect, interoception, action, and memory-related processing. Since our study was performed with naturalistic real-life resembling emotional videos, the study contributes significantly to understanding the dynamics of emotion processing. The results support constructivist theories of emotional experience and show that changes in dynamic functional connectivity can predict aspects of our emotional experience.</p>

	<p>This systematic review&amp;amp;rsquo;s purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of lower-limb and foot somatosensory stimulation to improve balance and gait post-stroke. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed. Included studies: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English with ethical approval statement. Studies of conditions other than stroke, functional electrical stimulation, and interventions eliciting muscle contraction, were excluded. AgeLine, AMED, CINAHL PLUS, EMBASE, EMCARE MEDLINE, PEDro, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched from 1 January 2002 to 31 March 2022. Two authors independently screened results, extracted data and assessed study quality using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool; 16 RCTs (n = 638) were included. Four studies showed a medium or large standardized between-group effect size (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d) in favor of somatosensory stimulation, in relation to: customized insoles (d = 0.527), taping (d = 0.687), and electrical stimulation (two studies: d = 0.690 and d = 1.984). Although limited by study quality and heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, with only one study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results statistically significant, several interventions showed potential for benefit, exceeding the minimally important difference for gait speed. Further research with larger trials is required. This unfunded systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42022321199).</p>

	<p>Visual encoding models based on deep neural networks (DNN) show good performance in predicting brain activity in low-level visual areas. However, due to the amount of neural data limitation, DNN-based visual encoding models are difficult to fit for high-level visual areas, resulting in insufficient encoding performance. The ventral stream suggests that higher visual areas receive information from lower visual areas, which is not fully reflected in the current encoding models. In the present study, we propose a novel visual encoding model framework which uses the hierarchy of representations in the ventral stream to improve the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance in high-level visual areas. Under the framework, we propose two categories of hierarchical encoding models from the voxel and the feature perspectives to realize the hierarchical representations. From the voxel perspective, we first constructed an encoding model for the low-level visual area (V1 or V2) and extracted the voxel space predicted by the model. Then we use the extracted voxel space of the low-level visual area to predict the voxel space of the high-level visual area (V4 or LO) via constructing a voxel-to-voxel model. From the feature perspective, the feature space of the first model is extracted to predict the voxel space of the high-level visual area. The experimental results show that two categories of hierarchical encoding models effectively improve the encoding performance in V4 and LO. In addition, the proportion of the best-encoded voxels for different models in V4 and LO show that our proposed models have obvious advantages in prediction accuracy. We find that the hierarchy of representations in the ventral stream has a positive effect on improving the performance of the existing model in high-level visual areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale Computer Modeling of Spreading Depolarization in Brain Slices</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slow-moving wave of neuronal depolarization accompanied by a breakdown of ion concentration homeostasis, followed by long periods of neuronal silence (spreading depression), and is associated with several neurologic conditions. We developed multiscale (ions to tissue slice) computer models of SD in brain slices using the NEURON simulator: 36,000 neurons (two voltage-gated ion channels; three leak channels; three ion exchangers/pumps) in the extracellular space (ECS) of a slice (1 mm sides, varying thicknesses) with ion (K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>) and O<SUB>2</SUB> diffusion and equilibration with a surrounding bath. Glia and neurons cleared K<sup>+</sup> from the ECS via Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps. SD propagated through the slices at realistic speeds of 2&ndash;4 mm/min, which increased by as much as 50% in models incorporating the effects of hypoxia or propionate. In both cases, the speedup was mediated principally by ECS shrinkage. Our model allows us to make testable predictions, including the following: (1) SD can be inhibited by enlarging ECS volume; (2) SD velocity will be greater in areas with greater neuronal density, total neuronal volume, or larger/more dendrites; (3) SD is all-or-none: initiating K<sup>+</sup> bolus properties have little impact on SD speed; (4) Slice thickness influences SD because of relative hypoxia in the slice core, exacerbated by SD in a pathologic cycle; and (5) SD and high neuronal spike rates will be observed in the core of the slice. Cells in the periphery of the slice near an oxygenated bath will resist SD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TMS Does Not Increase BOLD Activity at the Site of Stimulation: A Review of All Concurrent TMS-fMRI Studies</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used for understanding brain function in neurologically intact subjects and for the treatment of various disorders. However, the precise neurophysiological effects of TMS at the site of stimulation remain poorly understood. The local effects of TMS can be studied using concurrent TMS-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique where TMS is delivered during fMRI scanning. However, although concurrent TMS-fMRI was developed over 20 years ago and dozens of studies have used this technique, there is still no consensus on whether TMS increases blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity at the site of stimulation. To address this question, here we review all previous concurrent TMS-fMRI studies that reported analyses of BOLD activity at the target location. We find evidence that TMS increases local BOLD activity when stimulating the primary motor (M1) and visual (V1) cortices but that these effects are likely driven by the downstream consequences of TMS (finger twitches and phosphenes). However, TMS does not appear to increase BOLD activity at the site of stimulation for areas outside of the M1 and V1 when conducted at rest. We examine the possible reasons for such lack of BOLD signal increase based on recent work in nonhuman animals. We argue that the current evidence points to TMS inducing periods of increased and decreased neuronal firing that mostly cancel each other out and therefore lead to no change in the overall BOLD signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">New Subregions of the Mouse Entopeduncular Nucleus Defined by the Complementary Immunoreactivities for Substance P and Cannabinoid Type-1 Receptor Combined with Distributions of Different Neuronal Types</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) constitute the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, but studies on the EPN are limited compared with those on the SNr. Both nuclei receive projections from the striatum with axons containing substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R), and immunoreactivities for these substances show complementary patterns in the striatum and SNr. In this study, we revealed a similar complementarity in the mouse EPN, combined it with region-specific neuronal distributions, and defined subregions of the EPN. First, the EPN was divided into two areas, one showing low SP and high CB1R (lSP/hCB1R) immunoreactivities, and the other showing high SP and low CB1R (hSP/lCB1R). The former received inputs from the dorsolateral striatum that are innervated by sensorimotor cortices, whereas the latter received inputs from the medial striatum that are innervated by limbic/association cortices. Then, the lSP/hCB1R area was further divided into the dorsolateral subregion in the rostral EPN and the core subregion in the caudal EPN, the latter characterized by the concentration of parvalbumin-positive neurons targeting the ventral anterior&ndash;ventral lateral thalamic nucleus. The hSP/lCB1R area was divided into the ventromedial subregion in the rostral EPN and the shell subregion in the caudal EPN, the former characterized by the concentration of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons targeting the lateral habenula (LHb). Somatostatin-positive neurons targeting the LHb were located diffusely in three subregions other than the core. These findings illuminate structural organization inside the basal ganglia, suggesting mechanisms for sorting diverse information through parallel loops with differing synaptic modulation by CB1R.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Studies on the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial activity, and toxicity of Catha edulis (Vahl.) Endl., in Sprague Dawley rats [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Mbeere South community of Embu County consume leaves of Catha edulis for its stimulant and euphoretic actions. Other indigenous uses of the plant are undocumented. Information on the pharmacology and safety of this plant is also scanty. This study aimed to document the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial properties, and toxicity of C. edulis leaves collected from the Mbeere South community in Kenya. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected from 35 informants using semi-structured questionnaires. Leaf extracts of C. edulis were prepared using acetone, water, and methanol. The antimicrobial properties of these extracts were evaluated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The toxicity of the aqueous extract was determined using hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg doses over 28 days. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: All informants were male, most were married, >50 years old, with >10 years of experience. The sources, local names, preparation, storage conditions, indications, frequency of use, dosage, and side effects of C. edulis were documented. All extracts were ineffective against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. They had limited efficacy against B. cereus and S. aureus. Significant differences were observed in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats at the tested doses. Low, intermediate, and high doses of the aqueous extract of C. edulis produced local congestion of the cardiac and hepatic vessels. Localized interstitial connective tissue proliferation, multifocal kidney interstitial hemorrhage, and localized tubular epithelium necrosis were also observed in female rats. Conclusions: The ethnobotanical uses of C. edulis among the Mbeere South community were documented for the first time. Limited antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity at high doses limit the use of leaves of C. edulis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Need for long term safety studies before recommending viral vector vaccines in kids [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Vaccines have played a central role in dealing with COVID-19 pandemic. Now regulatory agencies in USA and around the world have begun approving vaccination for kids. Long term safety profile of live attenuated viral vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines and peptide-based vaccines are well studied in children, are safe and can play a central role in controlling the spread of COVID19 in children. But the long-term safety profile of viral vector-based vaccines is not studied. In the present correspondence we highlight the possibility of random insertional mutagenesis and potential side effects, which might be evident after long-term.  Regulators must take into consideration the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and conduct long term studies before approving the viral vector vaccines in children, so that the public have trust in the regulatory agencies and are compliant towards vaccinating their children with safe and effective vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A rare presentation of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites complicated by tumor lysis syndrome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Only 32 cases of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites have currently been reported in the literature. We present the first reported case of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites whose treatment was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome along with a literature review evaluating similar cases. Case: We present a rare case of a 78-year-old retired Caucasian male with recurrent metastatic prostate cancer and malignant ascites. He had previously received definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer but presented with bilateral hydronephrosis and right-sided bladder wall thickening 10 years later. He had imaging evidence of locoregional recurrence with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and was initiated on combined androgen blockade with intramuscular leuprolide and oral bicalutamide. After being transferred to Scripps Clinic, he was found to have a solitary right upper lobe pulmonary lesion for which he completed stereotactic body radiation therapy. Then, 10 months later, he developed new onset malignant ascites and was treated with two cycles of intravenous docetaxel. Treatment resulted in improvement in his ascites and reduction in PSA. Unfortunately, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, encephalopathy, Escherichia coli bacteremia, and a fatal saddle pulmonary embolism. Conclusions: (1) Occurrence of ascites in prostate cancer patients is associated with worse prognosis than non-ascitic variants. (2) More common etiologies of ascites must be evaluated for. (3) Ascitic fluid prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurement may aid in diagnosis of malignant ascites in cases with diagnostic uncertainty. (4) Patients with advanced disease may benefit from combined hormonal and cytotoxic therapies. (5) Awareness of the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in patients treated for prostate cancer can help identify patients in whom prophylaxis would be beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The influence of strategic innovation management on firm innovation performance in the Indonesian mid-size telecommunication industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The telecommunication industry was one of the Indonesian government's priorities in the national development plan 2015-2035. “Primary Industry” was the term for the priority industries with the central role as the prime mover in the future national economy. Various natural, human, technological, innovative, and creative resources were imperative in supporting the underlining national industry development plan. Strategic innovation management refers to the entire sequence of innovation practices, including competition mechanism analysis, such as creating an innovative vision, business strategy alignment, disseminating strategy at an entire organizational level, market tendency, technology, and competitor’s action. Firm innovation performance refers to the measurement of innovation efficiency (the number of new products, product novelty, new product development speed, and new product success rate) and innovation profitability (new product revenue proportion, quality enhancement, cost reduction, and value improvement) conducted by the firm. This study investigates the effect of Innovation Strategy, Organizational Structure, Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Supplier Relationship (these were the practice of Strategic Innovation Management mentioned in various literature) on Firm Innovation Performance.  Methods: A quantitative method, from a practical perspective, was employed to investigate the causal relationship between strategic innovation management and firm innovation performance. Data was gathered through a validated and reliable questionnaire disseminated to 90 respondents. It included a representative from the four sub-sectors of the telecommunication industry, namely fixed networks, wireless networks, telecommunication services, and special telecommunication.  Results: The survey found that firms within the telecommunication industry already employed Strategic Innovation Management practices. Moreover, this study also found that Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Suppler Relationship significantly influence Firm Innovation Performance.  Conclusion:   The implementation of Strategic Innovation Management in the mid-size companies within Indonesia's telecommunication industry appears to be relatively high. It indicates that firms within the industry were able to strategically compete by implementing Strategic Innovation Management.
