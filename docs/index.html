<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previous studies have shown that lanthionine ketimine ethyl ester (LKE), a semi-synthetic derivative of the endogenous amino acid lanthionine, can induce proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) inÂ vivo. In the current study, we examined the effects of LKE on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in primary mouse OPCs, as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate those processes. Treatment with LKE stimulated proliferation of OPCs and increased the number of Olig2+, CC1+, and PLP+ cells. LKE also reduced cell death (caspase-3 expressing cells). Measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux showed that LKE increased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following stimulation with glutamate or ATP, and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux because of depolarization with KCl. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were also observed following treatment with a peptide that disrupts interactions of collapsin response mediated protein 2 (CRMP2), a primary target of LKE. These findings demonstrate regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in OPCs by LKE and suggest that these actions may be mediated, in part, by CRMP2. LKE or related analogs could therefore be of benefit for the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other demyelinating conditions.</p>

">Minimally verbal children with autism may see the point, but do not (always) point to what they see:A behavioral and eye-tracking study in visual perceptual processing</a></h4>

              
                During typical development, non social visual object recognition emerges in the first year of life, engaging both low level cues (e.g., color, orientation) and higher level mechanisms involving inference and prior knowledge. Little is known about how these processes function in minimally verbal children with autism (mvASD). We studied 22 children with mvASD using touchscreen based oddball and contour detection tasks, targeting low level (e.g., shape, orientation) and mid level (e.g., Kanizsa figures, 3D shapes) visual stimuli, measuring both pointing and eye gaze responses. All children detected the oddball in the easiest condition with faint distractors, and approximately half succeeded across all low level tasks. Notably, some high performers showed reduced accuracy under mid level conditions with greater stimulus complexity. Strikingly, and not originally anticipated, several low performers who failed to point correctly nonetheless fixated on the correct target. In the Kanizsa oddball task, several mvASD participants, unlike typically developing (TD) peers, consistently pointed to local inducers rather than to the center of the illusory triangle. While the overall deterioration in performance with increased visual complexity suggests that mvASD visual perception may rely on low level representations with attenuated inference based processing, the dissociation between gaze and pointing, along with atypical local pointing behavior, indicates that performance depends not only on what is perceived, but also on how they use the visual signal to drive their behavior. They may, see the point, but not point to what they see.

">Chemogenetic inhibition of amygdala to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex communication selectively impacts contingent learning</a></h4>

              
                Contingent learning, the process by which specific courses of action become associated with subsequent outcomes, is dependent on the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). The amygdala and vlPFC are bidirectionally connected but it is unclear what the contribution of individual feedforward and feedback pathways is to contingent learning. Here we tested the role of amygdala projections to vlPFC in mediating two key components of contingent learning: signaling the outcome (reward/no reward) that follows a choice and maintaining representation of the choice that was made prior to outcome delivery. To test for these two aspects of contingent learning, we trained macaques to perform a probabilistic reward learning task where for separate stimulus pairs reward was either delivered immediately or after a trace interval. Inhibiting vlPFC-projecting amygdala neurons impacted contingent learning irrespective of whether there was a trace interval or not, and this effect was primarily driven by maladaptive learning on unrewarded trials. Notably, deficits in contingent learning caused by manipulating activity in the amygdala-vlPFC pathway were distinct from impairments in motivation and the ability to update the value of specific rewards in a reinforcer devaluation task. Thus, vlPFC-projecting amygdala neurons appear to play a specific role in contingent learning through signaling the outcomes of a choice, but not in maintaining a memory of the prior choice.

">Frontal cortex organization supporting audiovisual processing during naturalistic viewing</a></h4>

              
                Our brains dynamically adapt to a multisensory world by orchestrating diverse inputs across sensory streams. This process engages multiple brain regions, but it remains unclear how audiovisual stimuli are represented and evolve over time, especially in naturalistic scenarios. Here, we employed movie-watching to explore this question. We recorded intracranial electrocorticography (iEEG) to measure brain activity in 19 participants watching a short multilingual movie. Using unsupervised clustering and supervised encoding models, we identified a robust modality-specific gradient in the frontal cortex, wherein the ventral division primarily processes auditory information and the dorsal division processes visual inputs. Further, we found that this cortical organization dynamically changed, adapting to different movie contexts. This result potentially reflects flexible audiovisual-resource assignment to construct a coherent percept of the movie. Leveraging behavioral ratings, we found that the frontal cortex is the primary site in this modality assignment process. Together, our findings shed new light on the functional architecture of the frontal cortex underlying flexible multisensory representation and integration in natural contexts.

                Introduction Young people in developing nations are particularly affected by HIV infection, which primarily spreads through sexual contact, including anal, oral, and vaginal sex. Heterosexual couples engage in female anal sex, a receptive sexual behavior in which the penis is placed in the female partnerâs anus. Anal intercourse has a higher risk of HIV transmission than vaginal intercourse, especially when there is appropriately low condom use, and the majority of couples are unaware of the risk of HIV transmission during anal intercourse. PROSPERO Registration number CRD42024629445 Objectives of the review To determine the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young Ethiopian people. Methods This systematic review of peer reviews published in English up to January 31, 2025, measures heterosexual anal and oral sex practices and contributing factors among young people in Ethiopia. STATA version 17 software was used to analyze the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young people in Ethiopia. Result Female young people were 2.45 times more likely to engage in heterosexual anal sex practice 95%CI, OR 4.05[1.57-3.33]. Young people who were living alone were 2.50 more likely involved in heterosexual anal sex practice with 95% CI, OR 2.50[1.60-3.40]).Those young people who live alone were 1.91 more likely engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice with 95% CI, OR 1.91[1.7-2.12]. Young people whose intimate partners engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice were 5.13 times more likely to engage in heterosexual oral sex practice in Ethiopia. Conclusions The pooled prevalence of heterosexual oral and anal sex practices in Ethiopia is high. Living alone and female sex were associated with heterosexual anal sex practices, while intimate partner engagement in oral heterosexual sex practice was associated with heterosexual oral sex practice among young people in Ethiopia.

                Purpose This study aims to identify research trends and map the academic structure in the field of employee performance over the past five years. Given the increasing complexity of organizations and post-pandemic work dynamics, bibliometric mapping is necessary to understand the evolution of themes, the contributions of key literature, and the future directions of knowledge development. Design/Methodology/Approach A total of 2,044 articles published between 2020 and 2025 are collected from the Scopus database. The article selection process adheres to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to ensure transparency and methodological rigor. Analysis is conducted using Bibliometrix R and VOSviewer, employing performance analysis and science mapping techniques. Visualization results include trending topics, a word cloud, the most globally cited documents, and network visualizations identifying the primary thematic clusters within the literature. Findings The findings indicate that research topics are shifting from general issues toward contemporary themes such as digital leadership, work well-being, and organizational adaptation to global changes. Seven primary clusters are identified, reflecting a multidisciplinary approach encompassing structural, psychological, and contextual dimensions. Additionally, articles with high normalized citation scores demonstrate that significant contributions come from practical and cross-sectoral studies. Originality/value The novelty of this study lies in mapping the intellectual structure and research trends of employee performance using Bibliometrix R and VOSviewer, focusing on the post-pandemic period (2020-2025). It uniquely employs trending topics and normalized citation analysis to identify emerging themes and influential publications in contemporary research.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individualâs genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method, The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelorâs degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                <p>by Yuxi Long, Bruce R. Donald</p>

Accurate binding affinity prediction (BAP) is crucial to structure-based drug design. We present PATH+, a novel, generalizable machine learning algorithm for BAP that exploits recent advances in computational topology. Compared to current binding affinity prediction algorithms, PATH+ shows similar or better accuracy and is more generalizable across orthogonal datasets. PATH+ is not only one of the most accurate algorithms for BAP, it is also the first algorithm that is inherently interpretable. Interpretability is a key factor of trust for an algorithm and alongside generalizability, allows PATH+ to be trusted in critical applications, such as inhibitor design. We visualized the features captured by PATH+ for two clinically relevant protein-ligand complexes and find that PATH+ captures binding-relevant structural mutations that are corroborated by biochemical data. Our work also sheds light on the features captured by current computational topology BAP algorithms that contributed to their high performance, which have been poorly understood. PATH+ also offers an improvement of ðª(m+n)3 in computational complexity and is empirically over 10 times faster than the dominant (uninterpretable) computational topology algorithm for BAP. Based on insights from PATH+, we built PATHâ, a scoring function for differentiating between binders and non-binders that has outstanding accuracy against 11 current algorithms for BAP. In summary, we report progress in a novel combination of interpretability, speed, and accuracy that should further empower topological screening of large virtual inhibitor libraries to protein targets, and allow binding affinity predictions to be understood and trusted. The source code for PATH+ and PATHâ are released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package.

                <p>by Xixuan Feng, Shuqin Zhang, Limin Li</p>

Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a fundamental biological process essential for maintaining the functionality of multicellular organisms. It allows cells to coordinate their activities, sustain tissue homeostasis, and adapt to environmental changes. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying intercellular communication remains challenging. The rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the analysis of CCC within its spatial context. Despite the development of several computational methods for inferring CCCs from ST data, most rely on literature-curated gene or protein interaction lists, which are often inadequate due to the restricted gene coverage. In this work, we propose OrgaCCC, an orthogonal graph autoencoders approach for cell-cell communication inference based on deep generative models. OrgaCCC leverages the information of gene expression profiles, spatial locations and ligand-receptor relationships. It captures both cell/spot and gene features using two orthogonally coupled variational graph autoencoders across cell/spot and gene dimensions and combines them by maximizing the similarity between their reconstructed cell/spot features. Numerical experiments on five ST datasets demonstrate the superiority of OrgaCCC compared with state-of-the-art methods in CCC inference at the cell-type level, cell/spot level, and ligand-receptor level, in terms of inference accuracy and reliability.

                <p>by Samuel Eriksson Lidbrink, Rebecca J. Howard, Nandan Haloi, Erik Lindahl</p>

The function of a protein is enabled by its conformational landscape. For non-rigid proteins, a complete characterization of this landscape requires understanding the proteinâs structure in all functional states, the stability of these states under target conditions, and the transition pathways between them. Several strategies have recently been developed to drive the machine learning algorithm AlphaFold2 (AF) to sample multiple conformations, but it is more challenging to a priori predict what states are stabilized in particular conditions and how the transition occurs. Here, we combine AF sampling with small-angle scattering curves to obtain a weighted conformational ensemble of functional states under target environmental conditions. We apply this to the pentameric ion channel GLIC using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) curves, and identify apparent closed and open states. By comparing experimental SANS data under resting and activating conditions, we can quantify the subpopulation of closed channels that open upon activation, matching both experiments and extensive simulation sampling using Markov state models. The predicted closed and open states closely resemble crystal structures determined under resting and activating conditions respectively, and project to predicted basins in free energy landscapes calculated from the Markov state models. Further, without using any structural information, the AF sampling also correctly captures intermediate conformations and projects onto the transition pathway resolved in the extensive sampling. This combination of machine learning algorithms and low-dimensional experimental data appears to provide an efficient way to predict not only stable conformations but also accurately sample the transition pathways several orders of magnitude faster than simulation-based sampling.

Single-cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (scAIRR-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide a transformative approach to profiling immune responses at unprecedented resolution across diverse pathophysiologic contexts. This work presents scRepertoire 2, a substantial update to our R package for analyzing and visualizing single-cell immune receptor data. This new version introduces an array of features designed to enhance both the depth and breadth of immune receptor analysis, including improved workflows for clonotype tracking, repertoire diversity metrics, and novel visualization modules that facilitate longitudinal and comparative studies. Additionally, scRepertoire 2 offers seamless integration with contemporary single-cell analysis frameworks like Seurat and SingleCellExperiment, allowing users to conduct end-to-end single-cell immune profiling with transcriptomic data. Performance optimizations in scRepertoire 2 resulted in a 85.1% increase in speed and a 91.9% reduction in memory usage from the first version over the range repertoire size tested in benchmarking, addressing the demands of the ever-increasing size and scale of single-cell studies. This release marks an advancement in single cell immunogenomics, equipping researchers with a robust toolset to uncover immune dynamics in health and disease.

Attention samples visual space sequentially to enhance behaviorally relevant sensory representations. While traditionally conceptualized as a static continuous spotlight, contemporary models of attention highlight its discrete nature. But which neural mechanisms govern the temporally precise allocation of attention? Periodic brain activity as exemplified by neuronal oscillations as well as aperiodic temporal structure in the form of intrinsic neural timescales have been proposed to orchestrate the attentional sampling process in space and time. However, both mechanisms have been largely studied in isolation. To date, it remains unclear whether periodic and aperiodic temporal structure reflect distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we combined computational simulations with a multimodal approach encompassing five experiments, and three different variants of classic spatial attention paradigms, to differentiate aperiodic from oscillatory-based sampling. Converging evidence across behavior as well as scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that periodic and aperiodic temporal regularities can theoretically and experimentally be distinguished. Our results extend the rhythmic sampling framework of attention by demonstrating that aperiodic neural timescales predict behavior in a spatially-, context-, and demand-dependent manner. Aperiodic timescales increased from sensory to association cortex, decreased during sensory processing or action execution, and were prolonged with increasing behavioral demands. These results reveal that multiple, concurrent temporal regularities govern attentional sampling.

                Introduction and Importance Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital anomalies, occurring in about 1 in 25,000 births, with duodenal duplications making up 2% to 7% of cases. Typically diagnosed in childhood, they pose diagnostic challenges in adults. Case Presentation We present a case of a 14-year-old boy with mild epigastric pain, whose imaging revealed a large inter-duodeno-pancreatic cystic mass displacing nearby structures. Surgical exploration identified a cystic formation in the second part of the duodenum with a small communication to the duodenal lumen. A subtotal resection and cysto-duodenostomy were performed, leading to an uneventful postoperative recovery. Clinical Discussion Duplication cysts, or alimentary tract duplications, are rare congenital lesions, typically found in the distal ileum but infrequently in the duodenum. Diagnosed mainly in early childhood, they may occasionally present in adulthood, manifesting as abdominal mass, obstruction, or discomfort; in some cases, they mimic choledochal cysts, complicating diagnosis. Surgical removal is the standard treatment, focusing on ensuring proper drainage while preserving biliary and pancreatic ducts. Conclusion Duodenal duplication is a rare, challenging diagnosis in adolescents; this case offers guidance for timely identification and treatment. It aims to support healthcare providers in achieving timely diagnosis and effective management in similar cases.

                Abstract Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCAâs efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an emerging risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate CHIP's association with cerebrovascular or glymphatic changes in a community-based population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study examined Chinese community cohort participants. CHIP mutations were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Intracranial arterial stenosis, silent brain infarcts, cerebral small vessel disease markers, and diffusion along the perivascular space index were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. The correlation between CHIP and neuroimaging outcomes was investigated through univariate and multivariate logistic/linear regression. The multivariate regression model was adjusted for cerebrovascular disease risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 18.2% (224 out of 1,229) participants were identified as carriers of CHIP mutations. The prevalence of CHIP generally increases with age (<i>p</i>â=â0.009). After adjusting for vascular risk factors using multivariate regression, CHIP mutations were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of large magnetic resonance imaging-defined infarcts (&gt;15âmm; OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.18 to 8.43; <i>p</i>â=â0.018), inversely associated with diffusion along the perivascular space (<i>Î²</i>â=ââ0.02; 95% CI â0.04 to 0; <i>p</i>â=â0.034), and showed a borderline association with intracranial arterial stenosis (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.30; <i>p</i>â=â0.053). Notably, no statistically significant correlations were observed between CHIP and cerebral small vessel disease markers or brain atrophy measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CHIP was significantly associated with glymphatic dysfunction and large infarcts, and marginally associated with intracranial arterial stenosis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology linking CHIP to cerebral covert changes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

Using pYtags to characterize Torso activity during embryonic terminal patterning, they find that a dynamic domain of Torso activity is tuned by negative feedback to produce a longer-range stable gradient of ERK.

                Through CRISPR screening, Granda Farias et al. find results consistent with cis CD47-SIRPA interactions relying on QPCTL and that RAB21/Rab21 inactivation reduces macrophage model surface SIRPA/Sirpa expression. Through surface proteomics, they show that Rab21 inactivation modulates expression of macrophage receptors, e.g., Fc gamma receptors impacting phagocytosis of cells and particles.

They found that VCPIP1 enhanced innate immune activity by stabilizing IRAK1/2. Ablation of VCPIP1 reduces IRAK1/2 levels and thereby impairs inflammatory responses, resulting in attenuated sepsis.

Podoplanin deletion drives inflammation, disrupts lymph node architecture, and attenuates stromal/immune cell crosstalk. This study shows the significance of the podoplanin/CLEC-2 signaling axis beyond controlling cellular mechanics and actomyosin contractility.

SUV39H1 deposits lysine methylation at the IÎºBÎ± degron, which signals UACA binding and provokes IÎºBÎ± destabilization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101506">Neurons throughout the brain embed robust signatures of their anatomical location into spike trains</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain are known to encode diverse information through their spiking activity, primarily reflecting external stimuli and internal states. However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuronâs anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Computational approximations of anatomy have the potential to support in vivo electrode localization.

                <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i>, a cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobe, is considered by many to be a prime candidate for the realization of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) and is known as an industry standard for biofuel production. <i>C. thermocellum</i> is among the best biomass degraders identified to date in nature and produces ethanol as one of its main products. Many studies have helped increase ethanol titers in this microbe; however, ethanol production using <i>C. thermocellum</i> is still not economically viable. Therefore, a better understanding of its ethanol synthesis pathway is required. The main pathway for ethanol production in <i>C. thermocellum</i> involves the bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE). To better understand the function of the <i>C. thermocellum</i> AdhE, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a 3.28 Ã structure of the AdhE complex. This high-resolution structure, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, provides insight into the substrate channeling of the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde, indicates the potential role of <i>C. thermocellum</i> AdhE to regulate activity and cofactor pools, and establishes a basis for future engineering studies. The containment strategy found in this enzyme offers a template that could be replicated in other systems where toxic intermediates need to be sequestered to increase the production of valuable biochemicals.

">Temporal regulation of human reactive astrocytes reveals their capacity for antigen presentation</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes adapt to injury and disease by entering a reactive state defined by transcriptomic, morphological, and functional changes. Using a combination of human cortical organoids (hCOs) and primary fetal brain tissue, we investigated the plasticity of human astrocyte reactivity. We observed robust inflammatory transcriptomic and chromatin signatures following cytokine exposure, which varied with duration. To assess reversibility, we withdrew cytokines after acute or chronic exposure. In both cases, astrocytes returned to a quiescent genomic state within days. Chronic exposure induced MHC class II gene ex-pression, normally restricted to professional antigen-presenting cells. We validated MHCII protein in primary tissue and hCOs and used co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify candidate antigens. Finally, we showed that exogenous peptides from fetal neurons could be presented by astrocytic MHCII.

">Post-biting behavioral reprogramming underlies reproductive efficiency in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                The global spread and increasing populations of disease vector mosquitoes expose hundreds of millions of people to mosquito-borne illnesses each year. Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, global vectors of dengue, require protein from host blood to support egg development and undergo repeated cycles of blood-feeding and egg-laying. After biting, females temporarily alter their behavioral state and suppress host-seeking while using blood-derived nutrients to develop eggs. Host-seeking suppression ends once eggs are laid. While this period has generally been thought of as one of behavioral inactivity, we reveal that it instead reflects behavioral reprogramming, during which females transition from post-blood-meal inactivity into active searching for egg-laying sites. Females with mature eggs show a distinct behavioral state characterized by increased locomotor activity and a shift in circadian behavioral timing, leading to nocturnal humidity-seeking and egg-laying in an otherwise diurnal species. We show that the circadian clock gene cycle is critical for regulating this transition; its absence disrupts the timing of oviposition behaviors, leading to poor site selection and reduced predicted offspring survival. These findings suggest that during egg development, circadian clock-dependent behavioral reprogramming triggers nocturnal hyperactivity and oviposition site search, an essential process for mosquito reproduction and population viability.

">Information Spillover in Resting Memory and Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Our fMRI study investigates dependencies between brain areas during resting and working memory states using directed spillover indices estimated from vector autoregressive models that recognize dynamics in the network. A dorsolateral prefrontal centered system (DLPFC) demonstrates spillover memory capacity at rest, labeled resting memory, which facilitates self-referential thinking. Resting memory contains roughly 9 times more neurocognitive dependencies (spillover) as the difference in spillover between working and resting brains, suggesting that resting brains are highly active. The transitioning from resting memory to working memory is initiated by a right inferior fontal (IFG) centered system which connects to the DLPFC centered system when relevant information is detected in the outside world and also inhibits self-referential feedback in parietal cortices. Spillover between the IFG and DLPFC centered systems facilitate a smooth transition in attention from events that take place outside the brain to (sustained) representations of external events within the brain.

">Cerebellum and Plasma Metabolomics Identify Sepsis Biomarkers and MSC-sEV-Mediated Rescue</a></h4>

              
                Septic encephalopathy (SE) is a devastating complication of sepsis, marked by neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction, with the cerebellum being among the most affected brain regions. Progress in the field has been hindered by: (1) the incomplete characterization of cerebellar metabolic disruption in SE, (2) the limited understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicle (sEV) treatments in SE, and (3) the absence of reliable biomarkers for detecting SE. To address these gaps, we employed a murine sepsis model and performed metabolomic analyses of cerebellar tissue and plasma with and without MSC-sEV treatment. Sepsis induced profound cerebellar metabolic dysfunction, suppression of oxidative energy metabolism, and redox imbalance. MSC-sEVs mitigated these effects through their cargo, restoring cellular energetics and rebalancing antioxidant pathways. Cross-compartment analyses identified six plasma metabolites with strong diagnostic potential. These findings define key cerebellar metabolic mechanisms of SE and MSC-sEV treatment and propose plasma biomarkers for SE diagnostics.

">HILIC-Enabled Mass Spectrometric Discovery of Novel Endogenous and Glycosylated Neuropeptides in the American Lobster Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are a highly conserved and diverse class of intercellular signaling molecules that regulate a broad range of neural and hormonal processes across animal phyla. The American lobster, Homarus americanus, has long served as a powerful invertebrate model for the discovery and functional investigation of neuropeptides. Among common post-translational modifications (PTMs) found in neuropeptides, glycosylation remains underexplored due to the inherently low in vivo abundance and intrinsically complex structural heterogeneity. In this study, we employed hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) enrichment coupled with oxonium-ion triggered EThcD fragmentation strategy to simultaneously profile novel endogenous and glycosylated neuropeptides across eight distinct neural tissues and neuroendocrine organs of Homarus americanus. This integrative mass spectrometry-based approach led to the identification of 154 endogenous neuropeptides derived from 25 families, approximately one-third of which are newly reported, and uncovered 28 O-linked glycosylated neuropeptides in this species for the first time. These peptides exhibit strong tissue-specific expression, distinct proteolytic cleavage patterns, and confidently localized glycosylation sites. Our results highlight the utility of integrated sampling enrichment and hybrid fragmentation strategies for deep neuropeptidomic profiling and provide a valuable resource for future studies on the functional roles of newly identified neuropeptides and glycosylation in crustacean neuromodulation and peptidergic signaling.

">Independent directional tuning of the human triceps surae muscles during standing postural control</a></h4>

              
                The triceps surae, composed of the soleus (SOL) and medial (MG) and lateral (LG) gastrocnemii, are anatomically-derived synergists which act as a functional unit to plantarflex the ankle. However, anatomical differences suggest that each muscle is capable of generating distinct torques at the ankle, raising the possibility that each can be independently controlled to suit the needs of a given task. This possibility was explored by investigating the activation patterns of the triceps surae during two balance tasks that use different neuromechanical control strategies to maintain equilibrium. High-density surface EMG was recorded from the triceps surae of 14 healthy young adults during multiple trials of dual- and single-legged standing. Newly developed analyses examined how each muscle tuned its activity with center of pressure (COP) movement throughout 2-D space. During dual-legged standing, only the SOL and MG were active and both tuned their activity uniformly with anteroposterior COP movement. By contrast, during single-legged standing, each muscle showed robust activation and significantly different directional tuning, with the LG most active before medial COP movement, while SOL and MG were most active before lateral COP movement. Further analyses demonstrated the LG could be activated entirely independent of the SOL and MG, and vice versa, with independent activation of each muscle causing different angular deflections of the COP during single-, but not dual-legged standing. These observations reveal a sophisticated level of neural control, whereby the nervous system exploits subtle differences between highly similar muscles to tune balance corrective adjustments in a task-dependent manner.

">BELIEFS: A Hierarchical Theory of Mind Model based on StrategyInference</a></h4>

              
                Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer others' latent mental states, such as intentions, beliefs, and strategies, and use these inferences to predict behavior. A defining characteristic of ToM is its recursive nature: individuals reason not only about what others are thinking, but also about what others think about them. Most computational models of ToM adopt a hierarchical structure in which Level-0 (L0) agents are assumed to follow simple, fixed heuristics (e.g., Win-Stay-Lose-Shift, WSLS) without mentalizing. However, this assumption overlooks the diversity of non-mentalizing strategies exhibited in human behavior, such as imitation or tit-for-tat, which do not conform to WSLS yet require no recursive reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel ToM framework (BELIEFS) that flexibly infers latent L0 strategies from behavior rather than relying on predefined heuristics. We evaluated the model in four classic dyadic games: Matching Pennies, Prisoner's Dilemma, Bach or Stravinsky, and Stag Hunt, manipulating model's learning rates and the volatility of L0 strategy switching. Predictive accuracy was assessed using cumulative negative log-likelihood (NLL) of opponent's next choice and compared against both a ToM model that assumes only WSLS at L0 and chance-level performance. Our model outperformed both baselines, particularly under low-volatility conditions and at intermediate learning rate. Moreover, to evaluate strategy inference, we computed trial-wise confusion matrices and Cohen's k; between inferred and true L0 strategies, reaching significantly above-chance classification. We further tested the model's ability to distinguish between action sequences generated by the opponent's true Theory of Mind (ToM) level (L0 vs. L1) and those generated using an incorrect ToM level. The model assigned lower negative log-likelihoods (NLLs) to sequences from the true level, suggesting an indirect method for identifying the opponent's actual ToM level. Finally, we assessed whether the model effectively tracks behaviorally distinguishable action probabilities across ToM levels. Using Fisher-transformed correlations between model-generated action probabilities at L0, L1, and L2, we found significant dissimilarities, especially in competitive games. In summary, our model introduces a flexible, probabilistic approach to Theory of Mind that captures both surface-level strategy use and recursive reasoning depth. By jointly tracking dynamic beliefs over L0 strategies and ToM levels, the model adapts to behavioral shifts and outperforms static heuristics. These advances provide a powerful framework for modeling human behavior in interactive contexts, with implications for both human-human and human-machine interaction research.

">Interoception vs. Exteroception: Cardiac interoception competes with tactile perception, yet also facilitates self-relevance encoding</a></h4>

              
                Internal bodily signals, notably the heartbeat, influence our perception of the external world - but the nature of this influence remains unclear. One line of evidence (Competition) indicates that interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs compete for neural resources. Another line (Self-related Facilitation) shows a link between interoceptive and self-related processing, that might also include computing the self-relevance of exteroceptive inputs. We tested these seemingly opposing views within a single experimental task. Measuring heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs, a measure of cardiac interoception) with EEG, we manipulated the self-relevance of an audio-tactile stimulus by placing the audio source either inside or outside the peripersonal space immediately around the body. This design ensured that Competition and Self-related Facilitation accounts yielded contrasting predictions. On the one hand, pre-stimulus HEP amplitudes over somatosensory cortex were linked to slower reaction times, and affected audio-tactile stimulus-evoked responses in the same area, indicating competition for shared neural resources. On the other hand, pre-stimulus HEPs over integrative sensorimotor and default-mode network regions facilitated subsequent self-relevance encoding, both in reaction times and audio-tactile stimulus evoked responses. Importantly, Competition and Facilitation effects were spatially and statistically independent from each other. We thereby reconcile the two views by showing the co-existence of two independent mechanisms: one that allocates neural resources to either internal bodily signals or the external world, and another by which interoception and exteroception are combined to determine the self-relevance of external signals. Our results highlight the multi-dimensionality of HEPs as neurophysiological markers, and thus of internal states more generally.

">CaV1.2-dependent excitation-transcription coupling modulates nociception</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nociceptive sensory neurons integrate various noxious inputs, resulting in local depolarization that triggers the firing of action potentials and thus the sensation of pain. We recently reported that nociceptor depolarization itself initiates signaling by the calcium channel CaV1.2 causing acute hyperalgesia in vivo. However, whether this mechanism initiates excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling and thereby leads to long-lasting modulation of nociceptor activity remains poorly understood. Using high content imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, we here found that depolarization of nociceptors induces phosphorylation of the transcription factor (TF) cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which was affected by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) and calcineurin, but not Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of CaV1.2 confirmed its role in calcium-dependent kinase signaling and CREB phosphorylation after depolarization. In line with this, pharmacological modulation of CaV1 channels affected the expression of a subset of depolarization-regulated immediate early genes known to orchestrate a broader transcriptional response. Indeed, RNA-Seq analysis of DRG neurons from mice with a tissue-specific deletion of CaV1.2 in nociceptive sensory neurons (SNS-Cacna1c-/- mice) revealed downregulation of multiple calcium and potassium channel subunits as well as proteins involved in synaptic vesicle release and cell adhesion. Furthermore, repetitive firing of action potentials and release of the neuropeptide CGRP was impaired in CaV1.2-deficient sensory neurons. SNS-Cacna1c-/- mice showed increased sensitivity to noxious heat and exacerbated inflammatory but not neuropathic pain. In conclusion, our data suggest a CaV1.2-dependent E-T coupling mechanism in nociceptors that counteracts nociception in vivo.

">The Ventral Tectal Longitudinal Column: A Midbrain Nucleus for Modulation of Auditory Processing in the Cochlear Nucleus, Superior Olivary Complex and Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                A ventral tectal longitudinal column (TLCv) has been described in rats and is hypothesized to provide multisensory modulation of acoustic processing in the superior olivary complex (Saldana et al., 2007, J Neurosci 27, 13108-16). The TLCv is a column of cells in the dorsomedial tectum extending rostro-caudally through the inferior and superior colliculi. It receives ascending auditory input and projects to the superior olivary complex. Further insight into TLCv function has been hampered by limited information on its connections. Here, we provide evidence that a TLCv is recognizable in mice and that it has more extensive connections than previously believed. Deposit of retrograde tracer into the superior olivary complex labels cells bilaterally in the TLCv, comparable to results seen in rats. Viral labeling of neuronal projections demonstrate input to the TLCv from the superior olivary complex and from the inferior colliculus. Thus, the TLCv in mice has inputs and outputs similar to those described in rats. Additional experiments with retrograde tracers revealed more extensive outputs from the TLCv. Neurons in the TLCv are labeled after deposit of retrograde tracers into the cochlear nucleus or into the inferior colliculus. The projections from the TLCv to these targets, like those to the superior olivary complex, are bilateral. These projections are much broader than those described previously. The results suggest that the TLCv could exert modulation over a wide expanse of the auditory brainstem, from the cochlear nucleus through the inferior colliculus.

">Modeling the Growth of Emotional and General Vocabulary Using Nonlinear Trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how emotional and general vocabulary develop across the lifespan offers key insights into cognitive and socioemotional processes. While emotional vocabulary is foundational for emotion regulation and social interaction, general vocabulary underpins broader cognitive functions such as reasoning and reading comprehension. In this study, we modeled the growth trajectories of emotional and general vocabulary using Gompertz functions in a large cross-sectional sample (N = 820; age range = 12 - 84 years). To control for item difficulty, we selected a subset of vocabulary items with similar and low difficulty in adulthood. Both vocabulary types showed non-linear growth patterns, with emotional vocabulary exhibiting earlier and faster development, reaching near-asymptotic levels by early adulthood. General vocabulary showed a more gradual increase and later inflection point. A joint nonlinear mixed-effects model confirmed significant differences in developmental timing, with emotional vocabulary peaking approximately four years earlier than general vocabulary. These findings support theoretical models emphasizing the early emergence and adaptive relevance of emotional concepts and highlight adolescence as a sensitive period for emotional vocabulary acquisition. The Gompertz model proved effective in capturing asymmetric vocabulary growth, providing interpretable parameters aligned with developmental theory. Implications for education and emotional development interventions are discussed.

">SynaptopathyDB: a resource for studying the genetic and synaptic basis of nervous system disorders</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction resulting from pathogenic variants in genes encoding synaptic proteins is a major contributor to brain and behavioural disorders, collectively termed synaptopathies. To facilitate research into the genetic basis and clinical manifestations of synaptopathy we have created SynaptopathyDB, an online resource that integrates data from 64 mammalian synapse proteomic studies and multiple genetic and phenotypic resources. We identified a consensus set of 3,437 mammalian synapse proteins from presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments, which have wide application in genetic and omic studies. Mutations in 954 genes encoding 28% of the consensus synapse proteome were associated with 1,266 OMIM diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system. We present findings that underscore the pervasive role of synaptic gene variants in the phenotypes of neurological, psychiatric, developmental, and systemic disorders highlighting the significant burden they impose on individuals and healthcare systems. SynaptopathyDB is a versatile platform and discovery tool for understanding the role of synapse proteins and genetic variants in human disease phenotypes.

">Dopamine receptor 1 specific CRISPRa mice exhibit disrupted behaviors and striatal baseline cellular activity</a></h4>

              
                The two main cell types in the striatum, dopamine receptor 1 and adenosine receptor 2a spiny projection neurons (D1-SPNs and A2A-SPNs), have distinct roles in regulating motor- and reward-related behaviors. Cre-selective CRISPR-dCas9 systems allow for cell-type specific, epigenomic-based manipulation of gene expression with gene-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and have potential to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying striatal subtype mediated behaviors. Conditional transgenic Rosa26:LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were recently generated to allow for robust expression of dCas9-p300 expression with Cre-driven cell-type specificity. This system utilizes p300, a histone acetyltransferase which regulates gene expression by unwinding chromatin and making that region of the genome more accessible for transcription. Rosa26-LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were paired with Drd1-Cre and Ador2a-Cre mice to generate Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 mouse lines and underwent behavioral phenotyping when sgRNAs were not present. Both Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 have cell-type specific expression of spCas9 mRNA. Baseline behavioral assessments revealed that, under a sgRNA absent nontargeted state, Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice display repetitive spinning behavior, hyperlocomotion and enhanced acquisition of reward learning in comparison to all genotypic littermates. In contrast, Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 do not exhibit any changes in behavior in comparison to their littermates. Electrophysiological recordings of dorsal striatum D1-SPNs revealed that Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice have increased input resistance and increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude, together suggesting greater excitatory drive of D1-SPNs. Overall, these data demonstrate the necessity to validate CRISPR-dCas9 lines for research investigations. Additionally, the Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 line has the potential to be used to study underlying mechanisms of stereotypy and reward-learning.

">Primary and secondary auditory cortex connectivity with brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional processing: in mouse and human</a></h4>

              
                Auditory cortex connectivity extends beyond the processing of acoustic stimuli, playing a crucial role in cognitive and emotional regulation through its interactions with higher-order brain regions. Although the neural mechanisms underlying acoustic information processing along the auditory pathway are well-documented, the connections supporting auditory-related cognitive and emotional processing, particularly in comparative studies between mice and human adults, are not yet fully clarified. In this study, we aim to investigate connections between the auditory cortex and brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional processing using retrograde fluoro-gold (FG) tracer in mice and 3-tesla high-resolution diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) in human adults. The FG injections into the primary (AI)/ secondary (AII) auditory cortices showed afferent connections with cortical (olfactory bulb, piriform, orbitofrontal, cingulate, motor, primary somatosensory, insular, visual, parietal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices), subcortical (amygdala, hippocampus, globus pallidus, claustrum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, diagonal band of the Broca and medial septal nucleus) and brainstem (raphe nuclei, pedunculopontine nucleus and locus coeruleus) structures. The DTI data obtained from human adults mostly corresponded with the experimental findings. Auditory cortical processing integrates auditory signals with other sensory, limbic and motor inputs. The connections collectively may suggest its role in cognitive and emotional functions. The auditory cortex is likely a critical hub within the neural circuitry underlying multisensory integration, decision-making, prediction, learning and memory functions. Understanding the connectivity of the auditory cortex can deepen our insight into its contribution to cognitive/emotional functions, offering new perspectives on the underlying mechanism linking hearing deficits with cognitive/emotional disorders.

">Competing Programs Shape Cortical Sensorimotor-Association Axis Development</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex is organized along a dominant sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis, anchored by modality-specific primary sensorimotor areas at one end and transmodal association areas that form distributed networks supporting abstract cognition at the other. The developmental mechanisms shaping this axis remain elusive. Here, we present converging multispecies evidence supporting the Multinodal Induction-Exclusion in Network Development (MIND) model, in which S-A patterning is governed by competing processes of induction and exclusion, driven by opposing transcriptional programs emerging from different nodes. Key molecular and connectional features of association cortices arise through pericentral programs, originating around fronto-temporal poles and partially regulated by retinoic acid. They progress inward toward central territories of the naive neocortex along fronto-temporally polarized trajectories. Central programs are induced through interactions between topographically separated first-order sensorimotor thalamocortical inputs and the neocortex, promoting the formation of primary areas while excluding pericentral programs. Influenced by SATB2 and ZBTB18, these evolutionarily conserved programs compete for the same territory and create spatial compartmentalization of axon guidance, cell-cell adhesion, retinoic acid signaling, synaptogenesis, Wnt signaling, and autism risk genes. Notably, PLXNC1 and SEMA7A exhibit anti-correlated expression and repulsive functions in shaping cortico-cortical connectivity along the S-A axis. These opposing processes of induction and exclusion establish an S-A equilibrium and topography in which primary sensorimotor areas emerge as focal islands within the broader ocean of distributed associative networks. The MIND model provides a unifying framework for understanding experimental, evolutionary, and clinical phenomena, revealing induction and exclusion as antagonistic complementary principles shaping the S-A axis and processing hierarchies.

                Sensory inputs are progressively transformed into internal representations of the environment along the cortical hierarchy. How does the behavioral relevance of these inputs affect this encoding? Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice navigating virtual-reality environments, we found that visual cortex maintained high sensory discrimination regardless of behavioural engagement, whereas the hippocampal dentate gyrus required active navigation for effective discrimination. These findings suggest that sensory cortices act as general-purpose sensory discriminators, while the hippocampus filters information based on task relevance.

">A selective top-down pathway from anterior cingulate cortex embeds a representation of saliency in hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                For maximizing survival, animals must accurately memorize the structure of their environment. This is achieved by stabilizing and enriching hippocampal place cells near salient features, while the representation of neutral locations incrementally drifts with time. However, the circuit mechanisms by which top-down and bottom-up inputs selectively embed saliency into the hippocampal spatial map remain poorly understood. Here we identified a specific top-down input from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the dysgranular zone of the retrosplenial cortex (RSCd) that becomes active exclusively at reward locations. Activity of these ACC neurons is both necessary and sufficient for shaping the hippocampal saliency map. Unlike dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, which respond to reward irrespective of the context, this class of ACC neurons encodes reward-context associations. Their optogenetic activation induces a reduction in locomotor speed, a behavioral correlate of saliency detection, while their inhibition disrupts the formation of the hippocampal place map. This work not only provides the first mechanistic insight into how context-dependent saliency is integrated in a top-down fashion into the hippocampal map to guide adaptive behavior but also challenges the classical view of memory consolidation theory where memory unidirectionally moves in bottom-up fashion from the hippocampus to the neocortex.

">The human claustrum initiates networks for externally and internally driven task demands.</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control is believed to arise from interactions among multiple brain networks depending on task demands. Although several debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by cognitive network dysfunction, the neural circuit mechanisms supporting task-dependent network activation are largely unknown. Because the claustrum possesses widespread connections with cortex and can synchronize distant cortical regions, we tested whether the claustrum activates task-dependent network states using fMRI during working memory (n = 420) and autobiographical memory (n = 35), tasks which elicit opposing responses from key cognitive control networks. In both tasks, the claustrum exhibited increased activity and excitatory influence on task-associated cognitive control network nodes, with corroborating underlying structural connectivity. The claustrum also displayed stronger excitatory effective connectivity during task performance and greater structural connectivity with task-related network nodes than regions prominently implicated in directing network states - the anterior insula and pulvinar. These findings establish a role for the claustrum in initiating network states for cognitive control.

">Functional Inputs to the Subgenual Cingulate Cortex Distinguish Neurotypical Individuals with Severe and Mild Depressive Problems: Granger Causality and Clustering Analyses</a></h4>

              
                Extant research has implicated functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in major depressive disorders or depressive traits in neurotypical populations. However, prior studies have not distinguished the inputs and outputs of the sgACC, and the diagnostic accuracy of these connectivity metrics remains elusive. Here, we analyzed data of 890 subjects (459 women, age 22 to 35) from the Human Connectome Project using Granger causality analyses (GCA) with the sgACC as the seed and 268 regions of interest from the Shen atlas as targets. Individual connectivities were assessed with an F test and group results were evaluated with a binomial test, both at a corrected threshold. We identified brain regions with significant input to and output from the sgACC. Clustering analyses of Granger causality input, but not Granger causality output or resting state connectivity features revealed distinct subject clusters, effectively distinguishing individuals with severe and mild depressive symptoms and those with comorbidities. Specifically, weaker projections from the fronto-parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, anterior insula, temporal cortices, and cerebellum to the sgACC characterized five clusters with low to high scores of depression as well as comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Machine learning using a logistic classifier with the significant GCA-in features and 5-fold cross-validation achieved 87% accuracy in distinguishing subject clusters, including those with high vs. low depression. These new findings specify the functional inputs and outputs of the sgACC and highlight an outsized role of sgACC inputs in distinguishing individuals with depressive and comorbid problems.

">The neural analysis toolkit unifies semi-analytical techniques to simplify, understand, and simulate dendrites</a></h4>

              
                While simulating compartmental dynamics in response to various input patterns is the prevalent technique for understanding dendritic computation, a great deal can be learned from classical analytical methods that provide solutions for the dendritic voltage. For example, such solutions are needed to simplify spatially extended neuron models, to understand frequency-dependent response properties, to elucidate the interaction between synaptic inputs, and hence to reveal the effective compartmentalization of dendrites into functional subunits. Nevertheless, these methods have not been implemented in modern software tools. This works describes the NEural Analysis Toolkit (NEAT), a Python toolbox that implements classical algorithms to compute response properties of spatially extended neuron models, and that leverages these algorithms to simplify them. Packaged with this are a range of useful utilities to plot morphologies and spatial quantities defined on the morphology, to distribute locations on the morphology, and to select parts of the morphology to e.g. apply morphological ablations or alter the membrane properties. The resulting models can be exported to NEURON and NEST, two commonly used simulators, the former focused on detailed single neuron model simulations, and the latter geared towards distributed network simulations. As a consequence, this toolbox provides a missing link between single neuron computation and large-scale network analysis, substantially facilitating the study of the role of dendritic computation in shaping emergent network dynamics. NEAT is available through pip under the name nest-neat, or from its source code (https://github.com/nest/NEAT), which is provided under the GNU General Public License. Furthermore, support for NEAT is provided on its GitHub page and through the NEST user mailing list (users@nest-simulator.org).

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CACNA1C</span> gene, which encodes the L-type calcium channel Î±<sub>1</sub> Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit. While it is expressed throughout the body, the most serious symptoms are cardiac and neurological. Classical TS type 1 (TS1) and TS type 2 (TS2) mutations cause prolonged action potentials (APs) in cardiomyocytes and in induced neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells taken from TS patients, but the effects of TS mutations on neuronal function in vivo are not fully understood. TS is frequently associated with autistic traits, which in turn have been linked to altered sensory processing. Using the TS2-neo mouse model, we analyzed the effects of TS2 mutation on the visual system. We observed a widening of APs of pyramidal cells in ex vivo patch clamp recordings and an increase in the density of parvalbumin-positive cells in the primary visual cortex. Neurons from TS2-neo mice recorded extracellularly in vivo were less likely to respond to visual stimuli of low spatial frequency, but more likely to respond to visual stimuli of mid-to-high spatial frequency, compared to those from wild-type mice. These results point to a basic processing abnormality in the visual cortex of TS2-neo mice.</span>

Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis identified distinct theta band oscillations between the groups. The source localization highlighted the superior parietal lobule (SPL) as a critical region associated with expertsâ enhanced motor prediction capabilities. The second experiment employed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to inhibit SPL activity and explore its causal role in motor expertise. Results indicated that rTMS disrupted specific neural oscillations but did not significantly alter behavioral performance, suggesting compensatory mechanisms in functionally connected regions. Differences in theta and beta oscillations between experts and novicesâ post-stimulation highlight the adaptive neural plasticity underlying motor expertise.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fast and accurate sensoryâmotor mapping is characteristic of successful interaction with our environment and decision-making. Learning is crucial for the development of decision-making processes and has been linked to the balance of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (Î³-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurochemicals in the cortex. However, learning is not a unitary phenomenon and occurs across time. How neurochemical concentrations are involved, and the role of interventions like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remains unclear. The efficacy of tDCS to modulate learning has been linked to baseline concentrations of GABA and glutamate, and stimulation may influence neurochemical concentrations. Here, we assessed how neurochemical balance is associated with tDCS modulations to early- and later-phase sensoryâmotor learning using in vivo 7T ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the right motor cortex (M1), right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and left prefrontal cortex. A single-dual task paradigm assessed performance immediately post (early learning) and 20Â min post (later learning) offline cathodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex. tDCS modulations to learning were associated with neurochemical balance in right IPS during early learning, which shifted to right M1 for later learning. These findings elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms at play as sensoryâresponse mappings shift from executive to motoric operations.</span>

                <p>Savings refers to the gain in performance upon relearning. In sensorimotor adaptation, savings is tested by having participants adapt to perturbed feedback and, following a washout block during which the system resets to baseline, presenting the same perturbation again. While savings has been observed with these tasks, we have shown that the contribution from implicit adaptation, a process that uses errors to recalibrate the sensorimotor map, is attenuated upon relearning (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Avraham et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we test the hypothesis that this attenuation is due to interference arising from the different relationship between the movement and the feedback during washout. Removing the perturbation at the start of the washout block typically results in a salient error signal in the opposite direction to that observed during learning. We first replicated the finding that implicit adaptation is attenuated following a washout period that introduces salient opposite errors. When we eliminated feedback during washout, relearning was no longer attenuated, consistent with the interference hypothesis. Next, we created a scenario in which the perceived errors during washout were not salient, falling within the range of motor noise. Nonetheless, attenuation was still prominent. Inspired by this observation, we tested participants with an extended initial experience with veridical feedback and found that this was sufficient to attenuate adaptation during the first learning block. This effect was context specific and did not generalize to other movements. Taken together, the implicit sensorimotor adaptation system is highly sensitive to memory interference from a recent experience with a discrepant action-outcome contingency.</p>

                <p>Animal studies and human tissue experiments have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes damage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). To test the hypothesis that TBI causes disruption of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) in the ECM, we measured levels of sGAG in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and urine, in patients with severe TBI in the acute postinjury period. Samples of CSF, blood, and urine were obtained within 72&nbsp;h of injury in patients who received external ventricular drains as part of their treatment of severe TBI. Levels of chondroitin and heparan sGAGs were measured, along with their disaccharide constituents. Demographic information, presence of polytrauma, brain injury load, and distance of radiologically visible parenchymal injury from the ventricle were analyzed for correlation with total subtype sGAG levels. Levels were measured in 14 patients ranging in age from 17 to 90 years. CSF sGAG levels were variable among patients, with higher sGAG levels in plasma compared with CSF. Patients with polytrauma had nonsignificantly higher blood sGAG compared with patients with isolated head injury. Subcategories of CSF sGAG levels correlated with distance from the ventricle of parenchymal injury but not with brain injury load. This study is the first to measure sGAG levels in ventricular CSF and the first to analyze levels in TBI. These data demonstrate the elevation locally of intracranial sGAGs after severe TBI and suggest rapid local metabolism of these breakdown products. The consequences of ECM breakdown may provide unique therapeutic and preventive avenues to mitigate postinjury sequelae.</p>

                <p>by Bart Borghans, Daniel Kortzak, Piersilvio Longo, Bettina Kolen, Jan-Philipp Machtens, Christoph Fahlke</p>

Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) fill synaptic vesicles with glutamate and remove luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> via an additional anion channel mode. Both of these transport functions are stimulated by luminal acidification, luminal-positive membrane potential, and luminal Cl<sup>-</sup>. We studied VGLUT1 transporter/channel activation using a combination of heterologous expression, cellular electrophysiology, fast solution exchange, and mathematical modeling. Cl<sup>-</sup> channel gating can be described with a kinetic scheme that includes two protonation sites and distinct opening, closing, and Cl<sup>-</sup>-binding rates for each protonation state. Cl<sup>-</sup> binding promotes channel opening by modifying the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values of the protonation sites and rates of pore opening and closure. VGLUT1 transports glutamate and aspartate at distinct stoichiometries: H<sup>+</sup>-glutamate exchange at 1:1 stoichiometry and aspartate uniport. Neurotransmitter transport with variable stoichiometry can be described with an alternating access model that assumes that transporters without substrate translocate in the doubly protonated state to the inward-facing conformation and return with the bound amino acid substrate as either singly or doubly protonated. Glutamate, but not aspartate, promotes the release of one proton from inward-facing VGLUT1, resulting in preferential H<sup>+</sup>-coupled glutamate exchange. Cl<sup>-</sup> stimulates glutamate transport by making the glutamate-binding site accessible to cytoplasmic glutamate and by facilitating transitions to the inward-facing conformation after outward substrate release. We conclude that allosteric modification of transporter protonation by Cl<sup>-</sup> is crucial for both VGLUT1 transport functions.

Background <p>Polygenic risk score (PRS) have proved to offer robust risk prediction for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the global CAD PRS summarizes the joint effects of all the markers in the genome, masking potential genetic heterogeneity that may be important for disease interpretation and targeted interventions.</p> Methods <p>Using summary-level data, we identified 43 significant CAD-related traits based on genetic correlations, and further classified them into eight pleiotropy clusters based on their biological functions. We then partitioned the genome into 2,353 near-independent regions. Variants in each region were assigned to the trait most genetically similar to CAD, and then were labeled with the corresponding pleiotropy cluster. We grouped variants without labels into a ninth, non-specific cluster. The Pleiotropy Decomposed (PD) PRSs for each of the nine clusters were calculated using variants assigned to each cluster for 407,903 samples of European ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKBB).</p> Results <p>We decomposed the CAD PRS into nine PD-PRSs and further stratified individuals with high CAD-PRS into nine subgroups. Each PD-PRS accounted for a higher proportion of the global CAD-PRS within its corresponding subgroup than in the remaining subjects with high CAD-PRS (e.g., 25.2% (0.07) vs. 10.06% (0.07) for lipids-PD-PRS). Additionally, these subgroups showed distinct clinical features. For example, in the lipids-related subgroup, lipoprotein(a) and LDL-cholesterol levels were 67.5% and 18.3% higher, respectively, compared to the remaining high-risk individuals. Furthermore, significant interactions were observed between blood pressure and BP PD-PRS, and between current smoking and respiratory system PD-PRS.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings suggest that PD-PRSs may reveal substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals with high CAD-PRS. The unique PD-PRS compositions of each individual can highlight the relative importance of different pleiotropic regions.</p>

The risk of pandemics is increasing as global population growth and interconnectedness accelerate. Understanding the structural basis of protein-protein interactions between pathogens and hosts is critical for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and guiding treatment or vaccine development. Despite 21,064 experimentally supported human-pathogen interactions in the HPIDB, only 52 have resolved structures in the PDB, representing just 0.2%. Advances in protein complex structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, now enable highly accurate modelling of heterodimeric complexes, though their application to host-pathogen interactions, which have distinct evolutionary dynamics, remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the structural protein-protein interaction network between humans and ten pathogens, predicting structures for 9,452 interactions, only 10 of which have known structures. We identify 30 interactions with an expected TM-score â¥0.9, tripling the structural coverage in these networks. A detailed analysis of the Francisella tularensis dihydroprolyl dehydrogenase (IPD) complex with human immunoglobulin kappa constant (IGKC) using homology modelling and native mass spectrometry confirms a predicted 1:2:1 heterotetramer, suggesting potential roles in immune evasion. These findings highlight the transformative potential of structure prediction for rapidly advancing vaccine and drug development against novel pathogenic targets.

                <p>by Hilson Gomes Vilar de Andrade, Elisson da Silva Rocha, Kayo H. de Carvalho Monteiro, Cleber Matos de Morais, Danielle Christine Moura dos Santos, Dimas Cassimiro Nascimento, Raphael A. Dourado, Theo Lynn, Patricia Takako Endo</p>

Leprosy, or Hansenâs disease, is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) caused by <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves, causing neuropathy to varying degrees. It can result in physical disabilities and functional loss and is particularly prevalent amongst the most vulnerable populations in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The persistent stigma and social exclusion associated with leprosy complicate eradication efforts exacerbate the wider challenges faced by NTDs in sourcing the necessary resources and attention for control and elimination. The introduction of Multidrug Therapy (MDT) significantly lowers the global disease burden. Despite this breakthrough in the treatment of leprosy, over 200,000 new leprosy cases are reported annually across more than 120 countries, emphasizing the need for ongoing detection and management efforts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform leprosy care by accelerating early detection, improving accurate diagnosis, and enabling predictive modeling to improve the quality for those affected. The potential of AI to provide information to assist healthcare professionals in interventions that reduce the risk of disability, and consequently stigma, particularly in endemic regions, presents a promising path to reducing the incidence of leprosy and improving integration social status of patients. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the state of the art in research on the use of AI for leprosy care. From an initial 657 works from six scientific databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Springer), only 30 relevant works were identified, after analysis of three independent reviewers. We have excluded works due duplication, couldnât be retrieved and quality assessment. Results show that current research is focused primarily on the identification of symptoms using image based classification using three main techniques, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and support vector machines; a small number of studies focus on other thematic areas of leprosy care. A comprehensive systematic approach to research on the application of AI to leprosy care can make a meaningful contribution to a leprosy-free world and help deliver on the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

                <p>by Anika T. LÃ¶we, Marit Petzka, Maria M. Tzegka, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime nap. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27301?af=R">The Role of Electroencephalography in Predicting PostâStroke Seizures and an Updated Prognostic Model (SeLECTâEEG)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures negatively impact stroke outcomes, highlighting the need for reliable predictors of post-stroke epilepsy. Although acute symptomatic seizures are a known risk factor, most stroke survivors who develop epilepsy do not experience them. Early electroencephalography (EEG) findings may enhance risk prediction, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, aiding in patient management and counseling.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from 1,105 stroke survivors (mean age 71âyears, 54% male) with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent EEG within 7âdays post-stroke. Electrographic biomarkers, including epileptiform activity and regional slowing, were analyzed for their association with post-stroke epilepsy using Cox proportional hazards regression and FineâGray subdistribution hazard models, adjusted for differences in EEG timing and patient characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Post-stroke epilepsy developed in 119 patients (11%), whereas 233 (21%) had acute symptomatic seizures. The 5-year epilepsy risk was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30â49%) in patients with epileptiform activity versus 13% (95% CI: 9â16%) in those without. Regional slowing doubled the 5-year epilepsy risk (23%, 95% CI: 17â30% vs 11%, 95% CI: 7â16%). Epileptiform activity (subdistribution hazard ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5â3.4, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001) and regional slowing (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1â2.7, <i>p</i>â=â0.02) were independently associated with post-stroke epilepsy. A novel prognostic model, SeLECT-EEG (concordance statistic: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71â0.80), outperformed the previous standard (SeLECT<sub>2.0</sub>; 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65â0.76, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Electrographic biomarkers improve post-stroke epilepsy prediction beyond clinical risk factors. The SeLECT-EEG model enhances early risk stratification, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, informing management strategies and patient counseling.

                Background In 2022, WHOâs World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA75.8, emphasizing the critical role of clinical trials in generating high-quality evidence and promoting equitable access to health interventions globally. In response, rapid landscape reviews were conducted to assess global clinical trial regulations, capacities, and funding distribution. Methods The analysis synthesized regulatory frameworks from 94 countries, institutional capacity data from the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), and funding data from World RePORT for trials registered between 2018-2022. Gaps in data availability and quality were assessed. Results Most countries reference international ethical guidelines, with universal requirements for ethics approval and informed consent. However, only 66% mandate public trial registration, and 40% require results reporting, with stark disparities between high- and low-income countries. High-income countries host over half of global trials; low-income countries contribute less than 1% despite high disease burden. Clinical trials sponsored by non-commercial entities are particularly scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Funding remains concentrated in the Americas and European regions, primarily driven by major funders such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States of America and European Commission. Significant data accessibility challenges persist due to incomplete registry records, inconsistent standards, lack of harmonized identifiers, and limited bulk data access. Recommendations Urgent actions include reinforcing international standards for trial registries, harmonizing data fields, improving registry interoperability, leveraging unique identifiers, enhancing multilingual accessibility, auditing data quality, pooling analytical resources, promoting open data policies, and investing in registry infrastructure and trained personnel. Conclusion Addressing data gaps and inequities in clinical trial ecosystems requires concerted action by global stakeholders. Improved data transparency and interoperability are essential to guide equitable research investments, foster coordination, and strengthen clinical trial capacity worldwide.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The possible impact of meningeal Î¼-opioid receptor (Î¼OR) binding in migraine remains unknown. This study investigated Î¼OR availability in the cranial parameninges involved in migraine initiation via nociceptor activation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used positron emission tomography with [<sup>11</sup>C] carfentanil, and measured Î¼OR availability in meninges and adjacent skull bone (parameningeal tissue [PMT]) under resting and sustained thermal pain threshold stress challenge conditions. Î¼OR availability was compared between individuals with migraine in interictal and ictal phases and healthy controls. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between Î¼OR availability and headache intensity, as well as the potential influence of sex on this measure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 36 patients with interictal episodic migraine (8 also assessed ictally), 7 patients with ictal chronic migraine, and 22 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Both the episodic migraine and chronic migraine groups showed lower Î¼OR availability in the parietal PMT than healthy controls during the ictal resting phase. No significant differences were observed during the interictal phase. Exploratory analyses on the effects of sex indicated that both healthy women and migraine patients of both sexes showed lower Î¼OR availability in the frontal PMT compared with healthy men in the ictal sustained thermal pain threshold stress condition. Furthermore, the interictal Î¼OR availability in the frontal PMT was negatively associated with headache intensity in the preceding month.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed variability in PMT Î¼OR availability across the different cortical regions and migraine episodes, along with its association with pain intensity, underscores the critical role of extracerebral mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                da Silva Antunes et al. examine SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity across 3 years of repeated vaccinations. While antibodies increase with each booster, T cells responses plateau early and remain stable without signs of exhaustion or functional impairment. Asymptomatic infections promote Th17-like and regulatory CD4+ T cell expansion, suggesting balanced immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96157">Focal adhesion-derived liquid-liquid phase separations regulate mRNA translation</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a major organizing principle in cells. Recent work showed that multiple components of integrin-mediated focal adhesions, including p130Cas can form LLPS, which govern adhesion dynamics and related cell behaviors. In this study, we found that the focal adhesion protein p130Cas drives the formation of structures with the characteristics of LLPS that bud from focal adhesions into the cytoplasm. Condensing concentrated cytoplasm around p130Cas-coated beads allowed their isolation, which were enriched in a subset of focal adhesion proteins, mRNAs, and RNA binding proteins, including those implicated in inhibiting mRNA translation. Plating cells on very high concentrations of fibronectin to induce large focal adhesions inhibited message translation which required p130Cas and correlated with droplet formation. Photo-induction of p130Cas condensates using the Cry2 system also reduced translation. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in which high adhesion limits message translation via induction of p130Cas-dependent cytoplasmic LLPS. This mechanism may contribute to the quiescent state of very strongly adhesive myofibroblasts and senescent cells.

">Interference between flexible and adaptive reaching control</a></h4>

              
                Humans rapidly update the control of an ongoing movement following changes in contextual parameters. This involves adjusting the controller to exploit redundancy in the movement goal, such as when reaching for a narrow or wide target, and adapting to dynamic changes such as velocity-dependent force fields (FFs). Although flexible control and motor adaptation are computationally distinct, the fact that both unfold within the same movement suggests they may share common neural resources for task-specific adjustments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments combining changes in the target structure and a force field presented separately or in combination. Seventy-six human participants (both sexes) took part in this study, with each experiment involving different participants. They were asked to reach for a target that could change from a narrow square to a wide rectangle between or during trials. Step loads were used to assess whether participants exploited target redundancy. In a separate experiment, we added a force field in addition to target changes and step loads. Our results revealed a reduced ability to exploit target redundancy when sudden target changes occurred concurrently with FF adaptation. Furthermore, the magnitude of adaptation was reduced when step loads were added to the FF. Crucially, this interference emerged specifically when all perturbations impacted motor execution simultaneously. These results indicate that flexible control and motor adaptation interact in a non-trivial manner, suggesting possible overlap between their underlying neural mechanisms, and a clear identification of the timescale at which they are engaged, namely, during movement.

">Charting the single cell transcriptional landscape governing visual imprinting.</a></h4>

              
                Memory-related transcriptional events in brain remain poorly understood. Visual imprinting is a form of learning in which young animals develop preferences through early exposure to specific stimuli. In chicks, visual imprinting memory is stored in the intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM) of the forebrain. To investigate learning-associated molecular changes, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the left IMM in strongly imprinted chicks and untrained controls. This analysis identified over 30 cell clusters with distinct transcriptional differences putatively linked to memory formation, nearly half of them in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Expression levels of two lncRNAs and four protein-coding genes FOXP2, RORA, LUC7L, and ROBO1 correlate with memory strength, reflecting either innate learning potential or imprinting experience. Notably, the brain- and avian-specific lncRNA ENSGALG00010007489 is enriched in the nuclei of specific glutamatergic clusters. These findings offer the first single-cell resolution map of transcriptional changes underlying memory formation in the avian brain.

">NLRP3 inhibition maintains microglia architecture and enhances behavioral recovery after traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                NLRP3 plays an essential role in secondary neuroinflammatory damage following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the specific cellular substrates that mediate NLRP3's effects in TBI remain poorly understood, and it is unknown whether inhibition with recently developed oral compounds would confer a protective effect. In this study, we investigate the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in TBI-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral impairment, as well as the impact of its pharmacological inhibition. Following controlled cortical impact (CCI), most of the NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins and inflammatory markers are elevated during the first week post-injury but decrease by 30 days. Genetic deletion of the Nlrp3 gene, as well as treatment with oral NLRP3-specific inhibitors, preserves microglial homeostatic architecture, reduces ASC aggregation, and enhances neurological recovery and cognitive outcomes after CCI. Repeated intravital imaging of microglia confirms that NLRP3 inhibition prevents microglial activation after TBI. Our findings suggest that targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome could be a viable strategy for translation into clinical trials and may help prevent long-term neurocognitive decline following TBI.

">Neonatal mimicry of caregivers at home: feasibility of an asynchronous online paradigm</a></h4>

              
                While early life sets the stage for later learning, comparatively less is known about newborns' cognition than that of older infants. A striking example is the lack of consensus regarding the extent to which newborns spontaneously mimic gestures, and whether such behavior drives bonding and learning. Despite the theoretical importance of these questions, practical challenges limit researchers' ability to engage newborns in behavioral research. Webcam-based, asynchronous online studies have expanded developmental science's capacity to reach older infants. However, such scalable and replicable methods have yet to be deployed with younger infants. Taking a commonly-used neonatal mimicry paradigm as a test case, we assessed the feasibility of leveraging an open-source online platform (Children Helping Science) for asynchronous research with 0-6-week-olds and their caregivers. Caregivers modeled face movements to their 4-45 days-old infants (N = 29, N = 17 included) while webcams filmed their infants' responses; 13 dyads participated more than once (72 included test videos). There was preliminary, moderate evidence against group-level neonatal mimicry of caregivers' tongue protrusions (Bayes Factor ~ 1/3), and inconclusive evidence for or against mimicry of caregivers' mouth openings (1/3; < BF < 3). Simulations identified a target sample size for more conclusive evidence. Finally, we asked whether caregivers perceived their newborns' behavior as imitative. Caregivers' perceptions of mimicry reflected infants' behaviors but did not align with an often-used metric of mimicry ("imitators"). These results demonstrate the feasibility of asynchronous online behavioral studies with newborns and provide a foundation for future research on neonatal mimicry of caregivers.

">Untargeted Plasma Metabolomics in Canine Cognitive Dysfunction: The Naturally Occurring Alzheimer's Disease Analog in Dogs</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD) is an increasingly prevalent naturally occurring neurodegenerative condition in senescent dogs that share neuropathological and clinical features with human Alzheimers disease (AD). Metabolic profiling allows for identification of new candidates for AD biomarkers, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Despite its translational potential, plasma metabolomic profiling of dogs with CDD has not been previously characterized. Methods: This case control study analyzed plasma samples from ten client owned geriatric dogs, including five with severe CCD and five age matched, clinically healthy controls. Untargeted plasma metabolomics was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses identified significant metabolic differences between the groups. Metabolites were considered significant based on a variable importance in projection (VIP) score > 1.5, fold change (FC) > 2.0, and adjusted p-value < 0.05. Results: Fifteen metabolites across seven chemical classes were significantly altered in CCD dogs compared to controls, including glycerophospholipids, steroid derivatives, indoles, and mitochondrial-related compounds. Notably, elevated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA 20:2/0:0) and reduced ubiquinone-2 levels suggest dysregulation in neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Cholesterol exhibited the highest FC and VIP scores, further reinforcing its role in AD pathogenesis. Hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment analyses supported distinct metabolic signatures in CCD that mirror those observed in human AD. Discussion: This is the first untargeted plasma metabolomic profiling of dogs with CCD, revealing systemic metabolic disturbances that align with AD pathophysiology. Data was collected from senescent community-dwelling companion dogs, which enhances the studys ecological and translational relevance. It supports the utility of CCD as an AD model and highlight candidate plasma biomarkers that warrant further investigation. Future longitudinal studies integrating metabolomics with neuroimaging, histopathology, and behavioral assessments are required to validate these findings and contribute to AD biomarker discovery and therapeutic development

">CATERPillar: A Flexible Framework for Generating White Matter Numerical Substrates with incorporated Glial Cells</a></h4>

              
                Monte Carlo diffusion simulations in numerical substrates are valuable for exploring the sensitivity and specificity of the diffusion MRI (dMRI) signal to realistic cell microstructure features. A crucial component of such simulations is the use of numerical phantoms that accurately represent the target tissue, which is in this case, cerebral white matter (WM). This study introduces CATERPillar (Computational Axonal Threading Engine for Realistic Proliferation), a novel method that simulates the mechanic of axonal growth using overlapping spheres as elementary units. CATERPillar facilitates parallel axon development while preventing collisions, offering user control over key structural parameters such as cellular density, tortuosity, beading and myelination. Its uniqueness lies in its ability to generate not only realistic axonal structures but also realistic glial cells, enhancing the biological fidelity of simulations. We showed that our grown substrates feature distributions of key morphological parameters that agree with those from histological studies. The structural realism of the astrocytic components was quantitatively validated using Sholl analysis. Furthermore, the time-dependent diffusion in the extra- and intra-axonal compartments accurately reflected expected characteristics of short-range disorder, as predicted by theoretical models. CATERPillar is open source and can be used to (a) develop new acquisition schemes that sensitise the MRI signal to unique tissue microstructure features, (b) test the accuracy of a broad range of analytical models, and (c) build a set of substrates to train machine learning models on.

">Similar States, Different Paths: Neurodynamics of diverse meditation techniques</a></h4>

              
                Meditation encompasses diverse practices that train attention inward, in contrast to externally oriented task states. However, the neurodynamic features distinguishing meditative states from non-meditative states across traditions remain unclear. We analyzed high-density EEG data (N=170; 121 advanced meditators, 49 controls) across four traditions: Vipassana, Brahma Kumaris Raja Yoga, Heartfulness, and Isha Yoga. EEG features spanned oscillatory, aperiodic, nonlinear, and timescale components. Using random forest classifiers, we distinguished meditative from non-meditative states with robust classification performance (91%). Nonlinear features contributed the most, suggesting a core neurodynamic profile. Classification performance was higher in advanced meditators (92%) than in controls (85%), with distinct feature importance: nonlinear and aperiodic features dominated in meditators, and oscillatory and timescale features in controls. Each tradition showed distinct neurodynamic profiles, indicating technique-specific constellations. Our findings revealed shared yet distinct neurodynamic signatures across meditation techniques, suggesting that multiple neurodynamic pathways lead to meditative states.

                <p>Extracellular recordings in freely moving mice, especially those with movable electrodes (microdrives), are crucial for understanding brain function. However, existing microdrives are often heavy, expensive, fragile, and unsuited for long-term studies with multichannel recordings. The OptoDrive is a new, lightweight (3.2&nbsp;g), low-cost system for chronic neural recordings and optogenetic manipulation in mice. It features a detachable, 16-channel tungsten-wire electrode assembly with a 3&nbsp;mm stroke (15&nbsp;&mu;m step displacement) and an integrated optical fiber. This system enables repeated implantation and explantation without surgery, requiring only gas anesthesia. The OptoDrive has demonstrated stable recordings from the lateral hypothalamus of freely behaving mice for nearly 1&nbsp;month and successful optogenetic silencing of neuronal activity. In conclusion, OptoDrive offers a cost-effective, compact solution for long-term electrophysiology and optogenetics in freely moving mice.</p>

                <p>Marker-based motion capture (MBMC) is a powerful tool for precise, high-speed, three-dimensional tracking of animal movements, enabling detailed study of behaviors ranging from subtle limb trajectories to broad spatial exploration. Despite its proven utility in larger animals, MBMC has remained underutilized in mice due to the difficulty of robust marker attachment during unrestricted behavior. In response to this challenge, markerless tracking methods, facilitated by machine learning, have become the standard in small animal studies due to their simpler experimental setup. However, trajectories obtained with markerless approaches at best approximate ground-truth kinematics, with accuracy strongly dependent on video resolution, training dataset quality, and computational resources for data processing. Here, we overcome the primary limitation of MBMC in mice by implanting minimally invasive markers that remain securely attached over weeks of recordings. This technique produces high-resolution, artifact-free trajectories, eliminating the need for extensive post-processing. We demonstrate the advantages of MBMC by resolving subtle drug-induced kinematic changes that become apparent only within specific behavioral contexts, necessitating precise three-dimensional tracking beyond simple flat-surface locomotion. Furthermore, MBMC uniquely captures the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of harmaline-induced tremors, revealing previously inaccessible correlations between body parts and thus significantly improving the translational value of preclinical tremor models. While markerless tracking remains optimal for many behavioral neuroscience studies in which general posture estimation suffices, MBMC removes barriers to investigations demanding greater precision, reliability, and low-noise trajectories. This capability significantly broadens the scope for inquiry into the neuroscience of movement and related fields.</p>

                <p>When a cue is located away from its associated reward, some animals will learn to approach the site of reward (goal-tracking behavior) while others will approach the cue (sign-tracking behavior). The acquisition of sign tracking, but not goal tracking, is dependent on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and we have previously demonstrated that reward-evoked activity in the NAc core may reflect different patterns of dopamine release in sign tracker versus goal tracker individuals. However, a causal relationship among dopamine release, NAc activity, and sign tracking has not been established. Using male and female TH::Cre rats, we expressed inhibitory or excitatory opsins in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and examined the impact of optical manipulation of dopamine neurons on behavior and concurrent NAc neuronal activity. We found that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons at the time of reward suppressed the acquisition of sign-tracking, but not goal-tracking, behavior. On the other hand, stimulation of dopamine neurons did not alter the acquisition of sign tracking; however, cessation of stimulation impeded further acquisition of sign tracking. Finally, both inhibition and stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons rapidly modulated activity in a subset of NAc neurons and led to changes in cue- and reward-related activity across sessions. Overall, these findings support the ideas that sign tracking and goal tracking are the products of two different learning processes&mdash;one dopamine-dependent and one not&mdash;and that the impact of VTA dopamine on sign tracking may be mediated by activity in the NAc core.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a crucial role in excitatory neurotransmission, with numerous pathogenic variants identified in the GluN subunits, including their ligand-binding domains (LBDs). The prevailing hypothesis postulates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control machinery verifies the agonist occupancy of NMDARs, but this was tested in a limited number of studies. Using microscopy and electrophysiology in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, we found that surface expression of GluN1/GluN2A receptors containing a set of alanine substitutions within the LBDs correlated with the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for glycine (GluN1 subunit mutations) while not correlating with the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate (GluN2A subunit mutations). The mutant cycle of GluN1-S688 residue, including the pathogenic GluN1-S688Y and GluN1-S688P variants, showed a correlation between relative surface expression of the GluN1/GluN2A receptors and the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for glycine, as well as with the calculated <I>G</I><SUB>binding</SUB> values for glycine obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, the mutant cycle of GluN2A-S511 residue did not show any correlation between the relative surface expression of the GluN1/GluN2A receptors and the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate or calculated <I>G</I><SUB>binding</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate. Coexpression of both mutated GluN1 and GluN2A subunits led to additive or synergistic alterations in the surface number of GluN1/GluN2A receptors. The synchronized ER release by ARIAD technology confirmed the altered early trafficking of GluN1/GluN2A receptors containing the mutated LBDs. The microscopical analysis from embryonal rat hippocampal neurons (both sexes) corroborated our conclusions from the HEK293 cells.</p>

                <p>A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition. However, the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior are still poorly understood. We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B125">Voorhies et al., 2021</cross-ref>). These findings beg the question: What is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition? Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and the lateral parietal cortex in participants drawn from the same sample as our previous study. We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, 1,806 total) and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7&ndash;18 years (20 females). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci. Broadly, we found that (1) connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated and more accurately than cortical patches equated for size and shape; (2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; (3) sulci clustered based on connectivity patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and (4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation. These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be functionally relevant and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.</p>

                <p>Navigating within our neighborhood or learning a set of concepts requires remembering the relationship between individual items that are presented sequentially. Theta activity in the mammalian hippocampus is related to the encoding and recall of relational structures. However, how theta oscillations are involved in retrieving temporal order information in opposing directionality (forward vs backward) has not been characterized. Here, using intracranial recordings from 10 human epileptic patients of both genders with hippocampal electrodes, we tested the patients with a temporal order memory task in which they learned the spatial relationship among individual items arranged along a circular track and were tested on both forward-cued and backward-cued retrieval conditions. We found that sustained high-power oscillatory events in the hippocampal theta (2&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) band, as quantified by <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate, were higher for the backward conditions during the later stage but not in the earlier stage. The theta <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate results are consistent with the behavioral memory performance and the theta phase to gamma power cross-frequency coupling. Control analyses on change in theta or gamma power and their peak frequencies, aperiodic activity, hemispheric differences, and <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> duration confirm that elevated theta rhythmic activity carry specific physiological information with respect to experience-dependent (episodic) learning. In contrast, we observed a stronger effect of forward than backward retrieval for the low gamma (30&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz) <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate irrespective of stages. Our results revealed how theta oscillations are specifically implicated in the learning process for efficient retrieval of temporal order memories under opposing directionality.</p>

                <p>The neural processes that change when falling asleep are only partially understood. At the cortical level, features of both spontaneous neural activity and sensory responses change between wakefulness and sleep. For example, in the early auditory cortex, sleep increases the occurrence of postonset silent (OFF) periods and elevates population synchrony. However, it remains unknown whether such changes occur abruptly or gradually around sleep onset and awakening. Here, we recorded spontaneous and sound-evoked neuronal spiking activity in the early auditory cortex along with polysomnography during thousands of episodes when male rats fell asleep or woke up. We found that when falling asleep, stimulus-induced neuronal silent periods (OFF periods), characteristic of nonrapid eye movement sleep, increased within a few seconds around sleep onset. In contrast, a gradual increase in neuronal population synchrony built up over tens of seconds until reaching maximal levels. EEG auditory-evoked potentials likely representing stimulus-triggered "K-complexes" changed along with postonset neuronal firing, whereas ongoing EEG slow-wave activity was associated with neuronal population synchrony. Similar effects, but with opposite direction, were observed around awakenings. The results highlight late stimulus-induced neuronal silence as a key feature changing abruptly around transitions between vigilance states, likely reflecting neuronal bistability and manifesting also in EEG-evoked potentials. More generally, these findings emphasize the added value of going beyond monitoring ongoing activity and perturbing the nervous system to reveal its state&mdash;an insight that could also help guide the development of more sensitive noninvasive monitors of falling asleep in humans.</p>

                <p>We report here that microglia exert a surprisingly discrete but functionally critical influence on synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus. Treatment of adult male mice with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor antagonist PLX5622 (PLX), with resultant depletion of forebrain microglia, did not disturb basal synaptic transmission at four synaptic connections in the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was also intact for three of these sites, but the singular, endocannabinoid-dependent form of LTP expressed by lateral perforant path (LPP) input to the dentate gyrus (DG) was severely impaired. The LPP&ndash;LTP defect occurred in conjunction with a pronounced increase in DG (but not neocortical) levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the retrograde (spine-to-terminal) endocannabinoid messenger that initiates LPP&ndash;LTP. Despite this, concentrations of the 2-AG synthetic enzyme diacylglycerol lipase were not affected by PLX treatment. Synaptic levels of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, which mediates 2-AG effects on LPP&ndash;LTP, were similarly unaffected. Prior work has implicated the LPP in episodic memory. We determined that the LPP&ndash;LTP impairment in PLX-treated mice was accompanied by a failure to acquire the three basic elements of an episode: the identities, locations, and presentation order for a collection of olfactory cues. Treatment with JZL184, which inhibits the 2-AG degradative enzyme monoglyceride lipase, restored both LPP&ndash;LTP and episodic "What" encoding in PLX-treated mice. We conclude that microglia selectively regulate endocannabinoid transmission at the LPP-&gt;DG synapse and thereby potently influence synaptic plasticity at the initial stage of a corticohippocampal circuit that is critical for episodic memory.</p>

                <p>Speech is a multisensory signal that can be extracted from the voice and the lips. Previous studies suggested that occipital and temporal regions encode both auditory and visual speech features but their location and nature remain unclear. We characterized brain activity using fMRI (13 males and 11 females) to functionally and individually define bilateral fusiform face areas (FFA), the left word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex (word-VOTC), an audiovisual speech region in the left superior temporal sulcus (lSTS); and control regions in bilateral scene-selective parahippocampal place areas (PPA). In these regions, we performed multivariate pattern classification of corresponding phonemes (speech sounds) and visemes (lip movements). We observed that the word-VOTC and lSTS represent phonological information from both vision and sounds. The multisensory nature of phonological representations appeared selective to the word-VOTC, as we found viseme but not phoneme representation in adjacent FFA, while PPA did not encode phonology in any modality. Interestingly, cross-modal decoding revealed aligned phonological representations across the senses in lSTS, but not in word-VOTC. A whole-brain cross-modal searchlight analysis additionally revealed aligned audiovisual phonological representations in bilateral pSTS and left somato-motor cortex overlapping with oro-facial articulators. Altogether, our results demonstrate that auditory and visual phonology are represented in the word-VOTC, extending its functional coding beyond orthography. The geometries of auditory and visual representations do not align in the word-VOTC as they do in the STS and left somato-motor cortex, suggesting distinct representations across a distributed multisensory phonological network.</p>

                <p>Changes in the activity profile of cortical neurons are due to effects at the scale of local and long-range networks. Accordingly, abrupt transitions in the state of cortical neurons&mdash;a phenomenon known as Up&ndash;Down states (UDS)&mdash;have been attributed to variation in the activity of afferent neurons. However, cellular physiology and morphology may also play a role in causing UDS. This study examines the impact of dendritic nonlinearities, particularly those mediated by voltage-dependent NMDA receptors, on the response of cortical neurons to balanced excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs. Using a neuron model with two segregated dendritic compartments, we compared cells with and without dendritic nonlinearities. NMDA receptors boosted somatic firing in the balanced condition and increased the correlation between membrane potentials across the compartments of the neuron model. Dendritic nonlinearities elicited strong bimodality in the distribution of the somatic potential when the cell was driven with cortical-like input. Moreover, dendritic nonlinearities could detect small input fluctuations and lead to UDS whose statistics and dynamics closely resemble electrophysiological data. UDS also occurred in recurrent networks with oscillatory firing activity, as in anaesthetized animal models, when dendritic NMDA receptors were partially disabled. These findings suggest that there is a dissociation between cellular and network-level features that could both contribute to the emergence of UDS. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dendritic integration and activity-driven dynamics in the origin of cortical bistability.</p>

                <p>Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial in the tightly regulated process of neurogenesis from radial glial cells (RGCs) to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) to neurons during embryonic brain development. Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins as important epigenetic readers are implicated in development and diseases, yet their roles in embryonic neurogenesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we found different PHD finger proteins are differentially expressed along the neurogenesis trajectory. Among them, we investigated the function of PHF23 using mouse models, which is highly expressed in RGCs and IPCs, but not in neurons. Our findings demonstrate that PHF23 is essential for proper neurogenesis, and <I>Phf23</I> knock-out (<I>Phf2</I>3-KO) results in cortical developmental defects due to differentiation blockade of RGCs. Mechanistically, PHF23 bind with HDAC2, inhibiting its deacetylation activity on the active histone mark H3K27ac, thereby promoting the expression of neuronal differentiation pathway genes such as <I>Tcf4</I> and <I>Eya1</I>. Overexpression of <I>Tcf4</I> rescues the differentiation defects of <I>Phf2</I>3-KO NSCs. These results establish PHF23 as a pivotal regulator of neurogenesis, indicating cell type-specific functions of PHD finger proteins.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/26/e2307242025?rss=1">Inhibition of Rho-Associated Kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 as a Therapeutic Strategy to Reactivate the Repressed FXN Gene in Friedreich Ataxia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive damage to the nervous system and severe cardiac abnormalities. The disease is caused by a GAA&bull;TTC triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the <I>FXN</I> gene, resulting in epigenetic repression of <I>FXN</I> transcription and reduction in FXN (frataxin) protein which results in mitochondrial dysfunction. Factors and pathways that promote <I>FXN</I> repression represent potential therapeutic targets whose inhibition would restore <I>FXN</I> transcription and frataxin protein levels. Here, we performed a candidate-based RNAi screen to identify kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, that when knocked down upregulate <I>FXN</I> expression. Using this approach, we identified Rho kinase ROCK1 as a critical factor required for <I>FXN</I> repression. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of ROCK1, or the related kinase ROCK2, increases <I>FXN</I> mRNA and frataxin protein levels in FA patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neurons and cardiomyocytes to levels observed in normal cells. We demonstrate that small molecule ROCK inhibitors, including the FDA-approved drug belumosudil and fasudil, reactivate <I>FXN</I> expression in cultured FA iPSCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and FA patient primary fibroblasts and ameliorate the characteristic mitochondrial defects in these cell types. Remarkably, treatment of transgenic FA mice of both sexes with belumosudil or fasudil upregulates <I>FXN</I> expression, ameliorates the mitochondrial defects in the brain and heart tissues, and improves motor coordination and muscle strength. Collectively, our study identifies ROCK kinases as critical repressors of <I>FXN</I> expression and provides preclinical evidence that FDA-approved ROCK inhibitors may be repurposed for treatment of FA.</p>
