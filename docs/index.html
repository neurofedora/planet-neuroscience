            PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their associated PIWI proteins play an important role in repressing transposable elements in animal germlines. However, little is known about the function of PIWI proteins and piRNAs in the developing brain. Here, we investigated the role of an important PIWI family member, Piwi-like protein 1 (Piwil1; also known as Miwi in mouse) in the developing mouse neocortex. Using a Piwil1 knock-out (Piwil1 KO) mouse strain, we found that Piwil1 is essential for several steps of neocorticogenesis, including neocortical cell cycle, neuron migration and dendritogenesis. Piwil1 deletion resulted in increased cell cycle re-entry at embryonic day 17 (E17) when predominantly intracortically projecting neurons are being produced. Prenatal Piwil1 deletion increased the number of Pax6+ radial glia at postnatal day 0 (P0). Furthermore, Piwil1 deletion disrupted migration of Satb2+ neurons within deep layers at E17, P0 and P7. Satb2+ neurons showed increased colocalization with Bcl11b (also known as Ctip2), marker of subcortically projecting neurons. Piwil1 knock-outs had disrupted neocortical circuitry represented by thinning of the corpus callosum and altered dendritogenesis. We further investigated if Piwil1 deletion disrupted expression levels of neocortical piRNAs by small RNA sequencing in neocortex. We did not find differential expression of piRNAs in the neocortices of Piwil1 KO, while differences were observed in other Piwil1 KO tissues. This result suggests that Piwil1 may act independently of piRNAs and have novel roles in higher cognitive centers, such as neocortex. In addition, we report a screen of piRNAs derived from tRNA fragments in developing neocortices. Our result is the first report of selective subsets of piRNAs and tRNA fragments in developing prenatal neocortices and helps clarify some outstanding questions about the role of the piRNA pathway in the brain.

            Background: Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, present-centered awareness and acceptance of one's thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Interventions that promote mindfulness consistently show salutatory effects on cognition and psychological wellbeing in adults, and more recently, in children. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying mindfulness in children may allow for more judicious application of these techniques in clinical and educational settings. Methods: Using multi-echo/multi-band fMRI, we measured resting-state connectivity and tested the hypothesis that the association between mindfulness and anxiety in children (N=42) will relate to static and dynamic interactions between large-scale neural networks considered central to neurocognitive functioning and implicated in mindfulness in adults (default mode [DMN], salience and emotion [SEN], and central executive networks [CEN]). Results: Mindfulness was related to dynamic but not static connectivity in children. Specifically, more mindful children transitioned more between brain states over the course of the scan, spent overall less time in a certain connectivity state (state 2), and showed a state-specific reduction in SEN-right CEN connectivity (state 4). Results of a separate measure of present-focused thought during the resting-state were consistent with these results, suggesting state-trait convergence. Finally, the number of state transitions mediated the link between higher mindfulness and lower anxiety, suggesting that flexibility in transitioning between neural states may bridge the well-established link between mindfulness and anxiety in children. Conclusions: Results provide new insights into neural mechanisms underlying benefits of mindfulness on psychological health in children, and suggest that mindfulness relates to functional neural dynamics and interactions between neurocognitive networks, over time.

            Orientation in space is represented in specialized brain circuits. Persistent head direction signals are transmitted from anterior thalamus to the presubiculum, but the identity of the presubicular target neurons, their connectivity and function in local microcircuits are unknown. Here we examine how thalamic afferents recruit presubicular principal neurons and Martinotti interneurons and the ensuing synaptic interactions between these cells. Pyramidal neuron activation of Martinotti cells in superficial layers is strongly facilitating such that high frequency head directional stimulation efficiently unmutes synaptic excitation. Martinotti cell feedback plays a dual role: precisely timed spikes may not inhibit the firing of in-tune head direction cells, while exerting lateral inhibition. Autonomous attractor dynamics emerge from a modeled network implementing wiring motifs and timing sensitive synaptic interactions in the pyramidal - Martinotti cell feedback loop. This inhibitory microcircuit is therefore tuned to refine and maintain head direction information in the presubiculum.

            <p>by Luca Ponzoni, Giulia Rossetti, Luca Maggi, Alejandro Giorgetti, Paolo Carloni, Cristian Micheletti</p>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest superfamily of signaling proteins. Their activation process is accompanied by conformational changes that have not yet been fully uncovered. Here, we carry out a novel comparative analysis of internal structural fluctuations across a variety of receptors from class A GPCRs, which currently has the richest structural coverage. We infer the local mechanical couplings underpinning the receptors’ functional dynamics and finally identify those amino acids whose virtual deletion causes a significant softening of the mechanical network. The relevance of these amino acids is demonstrated by their overlap with those known to be crucial for GPCR function, based on static structural criteria. The differences with the latter set allow us to identify those sites whose functional role is more clearly detected by considering dynamical and mechanical properties. Of these sites with a genuine mechanical/dynamical character, the top ranking is amino acid 7x52, a previously unexplored, and experimentally verifiable key site for GPCR conformational response to ligand binding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5yO3v_6JZOI" width="1" />

            <p>by Stephanie Evans, Kieran Alden, Lourdes Cucurull-Sanchez, Christopher Larminie, Mark C. Coles, Marika C. Kullberg, Jon Timmis</p>

A calibrated computational model reflects behaviours that are expected or observed in a complex system, providing a baseline upon which sensitivity analysis techniques can be used to analyse pathways that may impact model responses. However, calibration of a model where a behaviour depends on an intervention introduced after a defined time point is difficult, as model responses may be dependent on the conditions at the time the intervention is applied. We present ASPASIA (Automated Simulation Parameter Alteration and SensItivity Analysis), a cross-platform, open-source Java toolkit that addresses a key deficiency in software tools for understanding the impact an intervention has on system behaviour for models specified in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). ASPASIA can generate and modify models using SBML solver output as an initial parameter set, allowing interventions to be applied once a steady state has been reached. Additionally, multiple SBML models can be generated where a subset of parameter values are perturbed using local and global sensitivity analysis techniques, revealing the model’s sensitivity to the intervention. To illustrate the capabilities of ASPASIA, we demonstrate how this tool has generated novel hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which Th17-cell plasticity may be controlled <i>in vivo</i>. By using ASPASIA in conjunction with an SBML model of Th17-cell polarisation, we predict that promotion of the Th1-associated transcription factor T-bet, rather than inhibition of the Th17-associated transcription factor ROR<i>γ</i>t, is sufficient to drive switching of Th17 cells towards an IFN-<i>γ</i>-producing phenotype. Our approach can be applied to all SBML-encoded models to predict the effect that intervention strategies have on system behaviour.

            <p>by Mark Roper, Chrisantha Fernando, Lars Chittka</p>

The ability to generalize over naturally occurring variation in cues indicating food or predation risk is highly useful for efficient decision-making in many animals. Honeybees have remarkable visual cognitive abilities, allowing them to classify visual patterns by common features despite having a relatively miniature brain. Here we ask the question whether generalization requires complex visual recognition or whether it can also be achieved with relatively simple neuronal mechanisms. We produced several simple models inspired by the known anatomical structures and neuronal responses within the bee brain and subsequently compared their ability to generalize achromatic patterns to the observed behavioural performance of honeybees on these cues. Neural networks with just eight large-field orientation-sensitive input neurons from the optic ganglia and a single layer of simple neuronal connectivity within the mushroom bodies (learning centres) show performances remarkably similar to a large proportion of the empirical results without requiring any form of learning, or fine-tuning of neuronal parameters to replicate these results. Indeed, a model simply combining sensory input from both eyes onto single mushroom body neurons returned correct discriminations even with partial occlusion of the patterns and an impressive invariance to the location of the test patterns on the eyes. This model also replicated surprising failures of bees to discriminate certain seemingly highly different patterns, providing novel and useful insights into the inner workings facilitating and limiting the utilisation of visual cues in honeybees. Our results reveal that reliable generalization of visual information can be achieved through simple neuronal circuitry that is biologically plausible and can easily be accommodated in a tiny insect brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OxcEoXhCzDg" width="1" />

            <p>by Miguel Won, Manuel Marques-Pita, Carlota Louro, Joana Gonçalves-Sá</p>

Every year, influenza epidemics affect millions of people and place a strong burden on health care services. A timely knowledge of the onset of the epidemic could allow these services to prepare for the peak. We present a method that can reliably identify and signal the influenza outbreak. By combining official Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) incidence rates, searches for ILI-related terms on Google, and an on-call triage phone service, Saúde 24, we were able to identify the beginning of the flu season in 8 European countries, anticipating current official alerts by several weeks. This work shows that it is possible to detect and consistently anticipate the onset of the flu season, in real-time, regardless of the amplitude of the epidemic, with obvious advantages for health care authorities. We also show that the method is not limited to one country, specific region or language, and that it provides a simple and reliable signal that can be used in early detection of other seasonal diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DRsEAt2kB3Y" width="1" />

            <p>by Berta Verd, Anton Crombach, Johannes Jaeger</p>

Pattern formation during development is a highly dynamic process. In spite of this, few experimental and modelling approaches take into account the explicit time-dependence of the rules governing regulatory systems. We address this problem by studying dynamic morphogen interpretation by the gap gene network in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Gap genes are involved in segment determination during early embryogenesis. They are activated by maternal morphogen gradients encoded by <i>bicoid (bcd)</i> and <i>caudal (cad)</i>. These gradients decay at the same time-scale as the establishment of the antero-posterior gap gene pattern. We use a reverse-engineering approach, based on data-driven regulatory models called gene circuits, to isolate and characterise the explicitly time-dependent effects of changing morphogen concentrations on gap gene regulation. To achieve this, we simulate the system in the presence and absence of dynamic gradient decay. Comparison between these simulations reveals that maternal morphogen decay controls the timing and limits the rate of gap gene expression. In the anterior of the embyro, it affects peak expression and leads to the establishment of smooth spatial boundaries between gap domains. In the posterior of the embryo, it causes a progressive slow-down in the rate of gap domain shifts, which is necessary to correctly position domain boundaries and to stabilise the spatial gap gene expression pattern. We use a newly developed method for the analysis of transient dynamics in non-autonomous (time-variable) systems to understand the regulatory causes of these effects. By providing a rigorous mechanistic explanation for the role of maternal gradient decay in gap gene regulation, our study demonstrates that such analyses are feasible and reveal important aspects of dynamic gene regulation which would have been missed by a traditional steady-state approach. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient dynamics for understanding complex regulatory processes in development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cNyXzA6TX1c" width="1" />

            Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a widely used model of addiction-related behavior whose underlying mechanism is not understood. In this study, we used dual site silicon probe recordings in freely moving mice to examine interactions between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in cocaine CPP. We found that CPP was associated with recruitment of nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons (MSNs) to fire in the cocaine-paired location, and this recruitment was driven predominantly by selective strengthening of hippocampal inputs arising from place cells that encode the cocaine-paired location. These findings provide in vivo evidence that the synaptic potentiation in the accumbens caused by repeated cocaine administration preferentially affects inputs that were active at the time of drug exposure. This provides a plausible physiological mechanism by which drug use becomes associated with specific environmental contexts.

            The use of standard anatomical templates is common in human neuroimaging, as it facilitates data analysis and comparison across subjects and studies. For non-human primates, previous in vivo templates have lacked sufficient contrast to reliably validate known anatomical brain regions and have not provided tools for automated single-subject processing. Here we present the National Institute of Mental Health Macaque Template, or NMT for short. The NMT is a high-resolution in vivo MRI template of the average macaque brain generated from 31 subjects, as well as a neuroimaging tool for improved data analysis and visualization. From the NMT volume, we generated maps of tissue segmentation and cortical thickness. Surface reconstructions and transformations to previously published digital brain atlases are also provided. We further provide an analysis pipeline using the NMT that automates and standardizes the time-consuming processes of brain extraction, tissue segmentation, and morphometric feature estimation for anatomical scans of individual subjects. The NMT and associated tools thus provide a common platform for precise single-subject data analysis and for characterizations of neuroimaging results across subjects and studies.

            Epilepsy is the most typical neurological disease in the world, and it implies an expensive and specialized diagnosis process based on electroencephalograms and video recordings. We developed a method that only requires the brainwave provided by the difference between two standard-located electrodes. Our proposed technique separates the original signal using a filter array with three different types of filters, and then extracts several features based on information theory and statistical information. In our study, we found that only 10 characteristics, of which the most important are related to higher frequencies, are required to offer an accuracy of 94%, a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 87% using C4.5 decision trees.

            A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the "hidden" portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron r' to a post-synaptic neuron r can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from r' to r plus corrections from every directed path from r' to r through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have--or do not have--major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a prominent example, we derive a formula for strong impact of hidden units in random networks with connection weights that scale with 1/{surd}N, where N is the network size--precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments.

            <p>by Olga K. Kamneva</p>

The genomic information of microbes is a major determinant of their phenotypic properties, yet it is largely unknown to what extent ecological associations between different species can be explained by their genome composition. To bridge this gap, this study introduces two new genome-wide pairwise measures of microbe-microbe interaction. The first (genome content similarity index) quantifies similarity in genome composition between two microbes, while the second (microbe-microbe functional association index) summarizes the topology of a protein functional association network built for a given pair of microbes and quantifies the fraction of network edges crossing organismal boundaries. These new indices are then used to predict co-occurrence between reference genomes from two 16S-based ecological datasets, accounting for phylogenetic relatedness of the taxa. Phylogenetic relatedness was found to be a strong predictor of ecological associations between microbes which explains about 10% of variance in co-occurrence data, but genome composition was found to be a strong predictor as well, it explains up to 4% the variance in co-occurrence when all genomic-based indices are used in combination, even after accounting for evolutionary relationships between the species. On their own, the metrics proposed here explain a larger proportion of variance than previously reported more complex methods that rely on metabolic network comparisons. In summary, results of this study indicate that microbial genomes do indeed contain detectable signal of organismal ecology, and the methods described in the paper can be used to improve mechanistic understanding of microbe-microbe interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vttGtlk4bxU" width="1" />

            <p>by Jerome M. Karp, Samuel Sparks, David Cowburn</p>

The structural mechanisms by which receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulate catalytic activity are diverse and often based on subtle changes in conformational dynamics. The regulatory mechanism of one such RTK, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) kinase, is still unknown, as the numerous crystal structures of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of the kinase domains show no apparent structural change that could explain how phosphorylation could enable catalytic activity. In this study, we use several enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) methods to elucidate the structural changes to the kinase’s activation loop that occur upon phosphorylation. We show that phosphorylation favors inward motion of Arg664, while simultaneously favoring outward motion of Leu665 and Pro666. The latter structural change enables the substrate to bind leading to its resultant phosphorylation. Inward motion of Arg664 allows it to interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP as well as the substrate tyrosine. We show that this stabilizes the tyrosine and primes it for the catalytic phosphotransfer, and it may lower the activation barrier of the phosphotransfer reaction. Our work demonstrates the value of including dynamic information gleaned from computer simulation in deciphering RTK regulatory function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGhtKnuezmU" width="1" />

            <p>by Guillaume Lajoie, Nedialko I. Krouchev, John F. Kalaska, Adrienne L. Fairhall, Eberhard E. Fetz</p>

Experiments show that spike-triggered stimulation performed with Bidirectional Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BBCI) can artificially strengthen connections between separate neural sites in motor cortex (MC). When spikes from a neuron recorded at one MC site trigger stimuli at a second target site after a fixed delay, the connections between sites eventually strengthen. It was also found that effective spike-stimulus delays are consistent with experimentally derived spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, suggesting that STDP is key to drive these changes. However, the impact of STDP at the level of circuits, and the mechanisms governing its modification with neural implants remain poorly understood. The present work describes a recurrent neural network model with probabilistic spiking mechanisms and plastic synapses capable of capturing both neural and synaptic activity statistics relevant to BBCI conditioning protocols. Our model successfully reproduces key experimental results, both established and new, and offers mechanistic insights into spike-triggered conditioning. Using analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we derive optimal operational regimes for BBCIs, and formulate predictions concerning the efficacy of spike-triggered conditioning in different regimes of cortical activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4hivcNKke9A" width="1" />

            <p>by Christoph Thiel, Henrik Cordes, Lorenzo Fabbri, Hélène Eloise Aschmann, Vanessa Baier, Ines Smit, Francis Atkinson, Lars Mathias Blank, Lars Kuepfer</p>

Drug-induced toxicity is a significant problem in clinical care. A key problem here is a general understanding of the molecular mechanisms accompanying the transition from desired drug effects to adverse events following administration of either therapeutic or toxic doses, in particular within a patient context. Here, a comparative toxicity analysis was performed for fifteen hepatotoxic drugs by evaluating toxic changes reflecting the transition from therapeutic drug responses to toxic reactions at the cellular level. By use of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling, in vitro toxicity data were first contextualized to quantitatively describe time-resolved drug responses within a patient context. Comparatively studying toxic changes across the considered hepatotoxicants allowed the identification of subsets of drugs sharing similar perturbations on key cellular processes, functional classes of genes, and individual genes. The identified subsets of drugs were next analyzed with regard to drug-related characteristics and their physicochemical properties. Toxic changes were finally evaluated to predict both molecular biomarkers and potential drug-drug interactions. The results may facilitate the early diagnosis of adverse drug events in clinical application.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-RR6tJ1aOgc" width="1" />

            Decades of cognitive neuroscience research have revealed two basic facts regarding task-driven brain activation patterns. First, distinct patterns of activation occur in response to different task demands. Second, a superordinate, dichotomous pattern of activation/de-activation, is commonly observed across a variety of task demands. We explore the possibility that a hierarchical model incorporates these two observed brain activation phenomena into a unifying framework. We apply a latent variable approach, exploratory bi-factor analysis, to a large set of brain activation patterns to determine the potential existence of a nested structure of factors that underlies a variety of commonly observed activation patterns. We find that a general factor, associated with a superordinate brain activation/de-activation pattern, explained the majority of the variance (52.37%). The bi-factor analysis also revealed several sub-factors that explained an additional 31.02% of variance in brain activation patterns, associated with different manifestations of the superordinate brain activation/de-activation pattern, each emphasizing different contexts in which the task demands occurred. Importantly, this nested factor structure provided better overall fit to the data compared with a non-nested factor structure model. These results point to domain-general psychological process, representing a 'focused awareness' process or 'attentional episode' that is variously manifested according to the sensory modality of the stimulus and degree of cognitive processing. This novel model provides the basis for constructing a biologically-informed, data-driven taxonomy of psychological processes.

            During embryogenesis, the ventral telencephalon gives rise to a remarkable variety of GABAergic cell types, from long-range projection neurons to locally-projecting interneurons. Our current understanding of how this diversity is generated is far from complete. Using Drop- seq to profile the single-cell transcriptomes of over 36,000 ventral telencephalic cells isolated from three distinct germinal zones (the ganglionic eminences), we found that regardless of their origin and ultimate fate, all lineages transit through one of three cardinal transcriptional programs that define the earliest branch points in cell fate determination. Thus, the ability of these germinal zones to generate distinct cells likely relies on the small number of genes that are differentially expressed within each of these regions.

            Alzheimer 's disease (AD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease highly correlated to aging. Whether AD originates by targeting a localized brain area and propagates to the rest of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown answer. Here, this question is addressed at the group-level by looking to differences in diffusion-tensor brain networks. In particular, making use of data from Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 4 different groups were defined (all of them matched by age, sex and education level): G1 (N1=36, healthy control participants, HC), G2 (N2=36, early mild cognitive impairment, EMCI), G3 (N3=36, late mild cognitive impairment, LMCI) and G4 (N4=36, AD). We built diffusion-tensor brain networks and performed group comparison across 3 disease stages: stage I (HC vs EMCI), stage II (HC vs LMCI) and stage III (HC vs AD). The group comparison was performed using the multivariate distance matrix regression analysis, a technique that was born in genomics and was recently proposed to handle functional network data, but here was applied to diffusion-tensor data. The results were three-fold: First, no significant differences were found in stage I. Second, in stage II, statistically significant differences were found in the connectivity pattern of a subnetwork strongly associated to memory function (including part of the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole). Third, a widespread disconnection across the entire AD brain was found in stage III, affecting stronger to the same memory subnetwork appearing in stage II plus to other subnetworks, including the default mode network, the medial visual network, frontoparietal regions, and subnetworks encompassing mainly subcortical structures (including part of the hippocampus, amygdala and putamen). The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that group differences were approached across severity progression. A better possibility would have been to analyze well time-resolved longitudinal data, building diffusion-tensor networks belonging to the same patient across all disease stages (from control to AD), but such data (to the best of our knowledge) are not available yet.

            Recent research indicates that attentional stimulus selection could in fact be a rhythmic process, operating as a sequence of successive cycles. When two items must be monitored, an intriguing corollary of this "blinking spotlight" notion could be that the successive cycles are directed alternately to each target; as a result, each item would effectively be selected at half the intrinsic rate of attentional selection. Here, we tested this prediction in two experiments. In an endogenous attention task, subjects covertly monitored one or two peripheral images in order to detect a brief contrast change. In the sustained occipital EEG power spectrum, selecting two vs. one item resulted in a relative increase around 4Hz and a relative decrease around 10-11Hz. In a second experiment, we tested if comparable oscillations could be observed in the stimulus-evoked EEG visual representational content. Subjects saw a first peripheral image displayed alone for 600ms, before a second one also appeared for the same duration, but at a different peripheral location. Using pattern analysis on EEG evoked- responses, we were able to create item selective classifiers that constantly indicated which stimulus was on the screen. The time-course of single-trial classifier decision values presented a relative spectral peak around 11Hz when only one object was present, and around 4-5Hz when two objects were on the screen. These results are both compatible with an attentional stimulus selection process sampling the visual field at around 10-11Hz, and resulting in a half-frequency effective sampling around 4-5Hz when there are two items to monitor.

            Music is increasingly used as an adjuvant for chronic pain management as it is not invasive, inexpensive, and patients usually report positive experiences with it. However, little is known about its clinical efficacy in chronic pain patients. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients that reported any type of music intervention for chronic pain, chosen by the researcher or patient, lasting for any duration. Searches were performed using PsycINFO, Scopus and PubMed for RTCs published until the end of May 2016. The primary outcome was reduction in self-reported pain using a standardized pain measurement instrument reported post-intervention. The secondary outcomes were: quality of life measures, depression and anxiety measures, among others. The study was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016039837) and the meta-analysis was done using RevMan. We identified 768 titles and abstracts, and we included 14 RTCs that fulfilled our criteria. The sample size of the studies varied between 25 and 200 participants. We found that music reduced chronic pain, and depression, with higher effect size on pain and depression. We also found music had a higher effect when the participant chose the music in contrast with researcher-chosen music. The sample size of RCTs was small and sometimes with different outcome measures. Our analysis suggests that music may be beneficial as an adjuvant for chronic pain patients, as it reduces self-reported pain and its common co-morbidities. Importantly, the analgesic effect of music appears higher with self-chosen over researcher-chosen music.

            <p>by Jannis Schuecker, Maximilian Schmidt, Sacha J. van Albada, Markus Diesmann, Moritz Helias</p>

The continuous integration of experimental data into coherent models of the brain is an increasing challenge of modern neuroscience. Such models provide a bridge between structure and activity, and identify the mechanisms giving rise to experimental observations. Nevertheless, structurally realistic network models of spiking neurons are necessarily underconstrained even if experimental data on brain connectivity are incorporated to the best of our knowledge. Guided by physiological observations, any model must therefore explore the parameter ranges within the uncertainty of the data. Based on simulation results alone, however, the mechanisms underlying stable and physiologically realistic activity often remain obscure. We here employ a mean-field reduction of the dynamics, which allows us to include activity constraints into the process of model construction. We shape the phase space of a multi-scale network model of the vision-related areas of macaque cortex by systematically refining its connectivity. Fundamental constraints on the activity, i.e., prohibiting quiescence and requiring global stability, prove sufficient to obtain realistic layer- and area-specific activity. Only small adaptations of the structure are required, showing that the network operates close to an instability. The procedure identifies components of the network critical to its collective dynamics and creates hypotheses for structural data and future experiments. The method can be applied to networks involving any neuron model with a known gain function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gngwunWtDI8" width="1" />

            <p>Research into the neural correlates of individual differences in imagery vividness point to an important role of the early visual cortex. However, there is also great fluctuation of vividness within individuals, such that only looking at differences between people necessarily obscures the picture. In this study, we show that variation in moment-to-moment experienced vividness of visual imagery, within human subjects, depends on the activity of a large network of brain areas, including frontal, parietal, and visual areas. Furthermore, using a novel multivariate analysis technique, we show that the neural overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual system correlates with experienced imagery vividness. This shows that the neural basis of imagery vividness is much more complicated than studies of individual differences seemed to suggest.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual imagery is the ability to visualize objects that are not in our direct line of sight: something that is important for memory, spatial reasoning, and many other tasks. It is known that the better people are at visual imagery, the better they can perform these tasks. However, the neural correlates of moment-to-moment variation in visual imagery remain unclear. In this study, we show that the more the neural response during imagery is similar to the neural response during perception, the more vivid or perception-like the imagery experience is.</p>

For example, electrical stimulation of the PPT region during sleep leads to rapid awakening, whereas lesions of the PPT in cats reduce REM sleep. Though these effects have been linked with the activity of cholinergic PPT neurons, the PPT also includes intermingled glutamatergic and GABAergic cell populations, and the precise roles of cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic PPT cell groups in regulating cortical activity and behavioral state remain unknown. Using a chemogenetic approach in three Cre-driver mouse lines, we found that selective activation of glutamatergic PPT neurons induced prolonged cortical activation and behavioral wakefulness, whereas inhibition reduced wakefulness and increased non-REM (NREM) sleep. Activation of cholinergic PPT neurons suppressed lower-frequency electroencephalogram rhythms during NREM sleep. Last, activation of GABAergic PPT neurons slightly reduced REM sleep. These findings reveal that glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic PPT neurons differentially influence cortical activity and sleep/wake states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> More than 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep disruption, and the development of effective treatments requires a more detailed understanding of the neuronal mechanisms controlling sleep and arousal. The pedunculopontine tegmental (PPT) nucleus has long been considered a key site for regulating wakefulness and REM sleep. This is mainly because of the cholinergic neurons contained in the PPT nucleus. However, the PPT nucleus also contains glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that likely contribute to the regulation of cortical activity and sleep–wake states. The chemogenetic experiments in the present study reveal that cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic PPT neurons each have distinct effects on sleep/wake behavior, improving our understanding of how the PPT nucleus regulates cortical activity and behavioral states.</p>

            <p>Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process whereby neuronal activity controls blood vessel diameter. In the cerebellum, the molecular layer is regarded as the main NVC determinant. However, the granular layer is a region with variable metabolic demand caused by large activity fluctuations that shows a prominent expression of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and is therefore much more suitable for effective NVC. Here, we show, in the granular layer of acute rat cerebellar slices, that capillary diameter changes rapidly after mossy fiber stimulation. Vasodilation required neuronal NMDARs and NOS stimulation and subsequent guanylyl cyclase activation that probably occurred in pericytes. Vasoconstriction required metabotropic glutamate receptors and CYP -hydroxylase, the enzyme regulating 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Therefore, granular layer capillaries are controlled by the balance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting systems that could finely tune local blood flow depending on neuronal activity changes at the cerebellar input stage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neuronal circuitry and the biochemical pathways that control local blood flow supply in the cerebellum are unclear. This is surprising given the emerging role played by this brain structure, not only in motor behavior, but also in cognitive functions. Although previous studies focused on the molecular layer, here, we shift attention onto the mossy fiber granule cell (GrC) relay. We demonstrate that GrC activity causes a robust vasodilation in nearby capillaries via the NMDA receptors–neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway. At the same time, metabotropic glutamate receptors mediate 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-dependent vasoconstriction. These results reveal a complex signaling network that hints for the first time at the granular layer as a major determinant of cerebellar blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals.</p>

            <p>The mammalian inner ear (IE) subserves auditory and vestibular sensations via highly specialized cells and proteins. Sensory receptor hair cells (HCs) are necessary for transducing mechanical inputs and stimulating sensory neurons by using a host of known and as yet unknown protein machinery. To understand the protein composition of these unique postmitotic cells, in which irreversible protein degradation or damage can lead to impaired hearing and balance, we analyzed IE samples by tandem mass spectrometry to generate an unbiased, shotgun-proteomics view of protein identities and abundances. By using Pou4f3/eGFP-transgenic mice in which HCs express GFP driven by <i>Pou4f3</i>, we FACS purified a population of HCs to analyze and compare the HC proteome with other IE subproteomes from sensory epithelia and whole IE. We show that the mammalian HC proteome comprises hundreds of uniquely or highly expressed proteins. Our global proteomic analysis of purified HCs extends the existing HC transcriptome, revealing previously undetected gene products and isoform-specific protein expression. Comparison of our proteomic data with mouse and human databases of genetic auditory/vestibular impairments confirms the critical role of the HC proteome for normal IE function, providing a cell-specific pool of candidates for novel, important HC genes. Several proteins identified exclusively in HCs by proteomics and verified by immunohistochemistry map to human genetic deafness loci, potentially representing new deafness genes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hearing and balance rely on specialized sensory hair cells (HCs) in the inner ear (IE) to convey information about sound, acceleration, and orientation to the brain. Genetically and environmentally induced perturbations to HC proteins can result in deafness and severe imbalance. We used transgenic mice with GFP-expressing HCs, coupled with FACS sorting and tandem mass spectrometry, to define the most complete HC and IE proteome to date. We show that hundreds of proteins are uniquely identified or enriched in HCs, extending previous gene expression analyses to reveal novel HC proteins and isoforms. Importantly, deafness-linked proteins were significantly enriched in HCs, suggesting that this in-depth proteomic analysis of IE sensory cells may hold potential for deafness gene discovery.</p>

            <p>Comprehending speech involves the rapid and optimally efficient mapping from sound to meaning. Influential cognitive models of spoken word recognition (Marslen-Wilson and Welsh, 1978) propose that the onset of a spoken word initiates a continuous process of activation of the lexical and semantic properties of the word candidates matching the speech input and competition between them, which continues until the point at which the word is differentiated from all other cohort candidates (the uniqueness point, UP). At this point, the word is recognized uniquely and only the target word's semantics are active. Although it is well established that spoken word recognition engages the superior (Rauschecker and Scott, 2009), middle, and inferior (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007) temporal cortices, little is known about the real-time brain activity that underpins the computations and representations that evolve over time during the transformation from speech to meaning. Here, we test for the first time the spatiotemporal dynamics of these processes by collecting MEG data while human participants listened to spoken words. By constructing quantitative models of competition and access to meaning in combination with spatiotemporal searchlight representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2006) in source space, we were able to test where and when these models produced significant effects. We found early transient effects ~400 ms before the UP of lexical competition in left supramarginal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and of semantic competition in MTG, left angular gyrus, and IFG. After the UP, there were no competitive effects, only target-specific semantic effects in angular gyrus and MTG.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding spoken words involves complex processes that transform the auditory input into a meaningful interpretation. This effortless transition occurs on millisecond timescales, with remarkable speed and accuracy and without any awareness of the complex computations involved. Here, we reveal the real-time neural dynamics of these processes by collecting data about listeners' brain activity as they hear spoken words. Using novel statistical models of different aspects of the recognition process, we can locate directly which parts of the brain are accessing the stored form and meaning of words and how the competition between different word candidates is resolved neurally in real time. This gives us a uniquely differentiated picture of the neural substrate for the first 500 ms of word recognition.</p>

            <p>The ability to improve motor function in spinal cord injury patients by reactivating spinal central pattern generators (CPGs) requires the elucidation of neurons and pathways involved in activation and modulation of spinal networks in accessible experimental models. Previously we reported on adrenoceptor-dependent sacral control of lumbar flexor motoneuron firing in newborn rats. The current work focuses on clarification of the circuitry and connectivity involved in this unique modulation and its potential use. Using surgical manipulations of the spinal gray and white matter, electrophysiological recordings, and confocal microscopy mapping, we found that methoxamine (METH) activation of sacral networks within the ventral aspect of S2 segments was sufficient to produce alternating rhythmic bursting (0.15–1 Hz) in lumbar flexor motoneurons. This lumbar rhythm depended on continuity of the ventral funiculus (VF) along the S2–L2 segments. Interrupting the VF abolished the rhythm and replaced it by slow unstable bursting. Calcium imaging of S1–S2 neurons, back-labeled via the VF, revealed that ~40% responded to METH, mostly by rhythmic firing. All uncrossed projecting METH responders and ~70% of crossed projecting METH responders fired with the concurrent ipsilateral motor output, while the rest (~30%) fired with the contralateral motor output. We suggest that METH-activated sacral CPGs excite ventral clusters of sacral VF neurons to deliver the ascending drive required for direct rhythmic activation of lumbar flexor motoneurons. The capacity of noradrenergic-activated sacral CPGs to modulate the activity of lumbar networks via sacral VF neurons provides a novel way to recruit rostral lumbar motoneurons and modulate the output required to execute various motor behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spinal central pattern generators (CPGs) produce the rhythmic output required for coordinating stepping and stabilizing the body axis during movements. Electrical stimulation and exogenous drugs can reactivate the spinal CPGs and improve the motor function in the absence of descending supraspinal control. Since the body-stabilizing sacral networks can activate and modulate the limb-moving lumbar circuitry, it is important to clarify the functional organization of sacral and lumbar networks and their linking pathways. Here we decipher the ascending circuitry linking adrenoceptor-activated sacral CPGs and lumbar flexor motoneurons, thereby providing novel insights into mechanisms by which sacral circuitry recruits lumbar flexors, and enhances the motor output during lumbar afferent-induced locomotor rhythms. Moreover, our findings might help to improve drug/electrical stimulation-based therapy to accelerate locomotor-based rehabilitation.</p>

            <p>Pitch and timbre are two primary dimensions of auditory perception, but how they are represented in the human brain remains a matter of contention. Some animal studies of auditory cortical processing have suggested modular processing, with different brain regions preferentially coding for pitch or timbre, whereas other studies have suggested a distributed code for different attributes across the same population of neurons. This study tested whether variations in pitch and timbre elicit activity in distinct regions of the human temporal lobes. Listeners were presented with sequences of sounds that varied in either fundamental frequency (eliciting changes in pitch) or spectral centroid (eliciting changes in brightness, an important attribute of timbre), with the degree of pitch or timbre variation in each sequence parametrically manipulated. The BOLD responses from auditory cortex increased with increasing sequence variance along each perceptual dimension. The spatial extent, region, and laterality of the cortical regions most responsive to variations in pitch or timbre at the univariate level of analysis were largely overlapping. However, patterns of activation in response to pitch or timbre variations were discriminable in most subjects at an individual level using multivoxel pattern analysis, suggesting a distributed coding of the two dimensions bilaterally in human auditory cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pitch and timbre are two crucial aspects of auditory perception. Pitch governs our perception of musical melodies and harmonies, and conveys both prosodic and (in tone languages) lexical information in speech. Brightness—an aspect of timbre or sound quality—allows us to distinguish different musical instruments and speech sounds. Frequency-mapping studies have revealed tonotopic organization in primary auditory cortex, but the use of pure tones or noise bands has precluded the possibility of dissociating pitch from brightness. Our results suggest a distributed code, with no clear anatomical distinctions between auditory cortical regions responsive to changes in either pitch or timbre, but also reveal a population code that can differentiate between changes in either dimension within the same cortical regions.</p>

            <p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix structures mainly enwrapping parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. The assembly of PNNs coincides with the end of the period of heightened visual cortex plasticity in juveniles, whereas removal of PNNs in adults reopens for plasticity. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. We have used chronic electrophysiological recordings to investigate accompanying electrophysiological changes to activity-dependent plasticity and we report on novel mechanisms involved in both induced and critical period plasticity. By inducing activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex of adult rats while recording single unit and population activity, we demonstrate that PNN removal alters the balance between inhibitory and excitatory spiking activity directly. Without PNNs, inhibitory activity was reduced, whereas spiking variability was increased as predicted in a simulation with a Brunel neural network. Together with a shift in ocular dominance and large effects on unit activity during the first 48 h of monocular deprivation (MD), we show that PNN removal resets the neural network to an immature, juvenile state. Furthermore, in PNN-depleted adults as well as in juveniles, MD caused an immediate potentiation of gamma activity, suggesting a novel mechanism initiating activity-dependent plasticity and driving the rapid changes in unit activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Emerging evidence suggests a role for perineuronal nets (PNNs) in learning and regulation of plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Here, we used chronic <i>in vivo</i> extracellular recordings to investigate how removal of PNNs opens for plasticity and how activity-dependent plasticity affects neural activity over time. PNN removal caused reduced inhibitory activity and reset the network to a juvenile state. Experimentally induced activity-dependent plasticity by monocular deprivation caused rapid changes in single unit activity and a remarkable potentiation of gamma oscillations. Our results demonstrate how PNNs may be involved directly in stabilizing the neural network. Moreover, the immediate potentiation of gamma activity after plasticity onset points to potential new mechanisms for the initiation of activity-dependent plasticity.</p>

            <p>The efficiency of finding an object in a crowded environment depends largely on the similarity of nontargets to the search target. Models of attention theorize that the similarity is determined by representations stored within an "attentional template" held in working memory. However, the degree to which the contents of the attentional template are individually unique and where those idiosyncratic representations are encoded in the brain are unknown. We investigated this problem using representational similarity analysis of human fMRI data to measure the common and idiosyncratic representations of famous face morphs during an identity categorization task; data from the categorization task were then used to predict performance on a separate identity search task. We hypothesized that the idiosyncratic categorical representations of the continuous face morphs would predict their distractability when searching for each target identity. The results identified that patterns of activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as well as in face-selective areas in the ventral temporal cortex were highly correlated with the patterns of behavioral categorization of face morphs and search performance that were common across subjects. However, the individually unique components of the categorization behavior were reliably decoded only in right LPFC. Moreover, the neural pattern in right LPFC successfully predicted idiosyncratic variability in search performance, such that reaction times were longer when distractors had a higher probability of being categorized as the target identity. These results suggest that the prefrontal cortex encodes individually unique components of categorical representations that are also present in attentional templates for target search.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Everyone's perception of the world is uniquely shaped by personal experiences and preferences. Using functional MRI, we show that individual differences in the categorization of face morphs between two identities could be decoded from the prefrontal cortex and the ventral temporal cortex. Moreover, the individually unique representations in prefrontal cortex predicted idiosyncratic variability in attentional performance when looking for each identity in the "crowd" of another morphed face in a separate search task. Our results reveal that the representation of task-related information in prefrontal cortex is individually unique and preserved across categorization and search performance. This demonstrates the possibility of predicting individual behaviors across tasks with patterns of brain activity.</p>

            <p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely perceived as a memory substrate and in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway, distinct forms of LTP depend on NMDA receptors (nmdaLTP) or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (vdccLTP). LTP is also known to be effectively regulated by extracellular proteolysis that is mediated by various enzymes. Herein, we investigated whether in mice hippocampal slices these distinct forms of LTP are specifically regulated by different metalloproteinases (MMPs). We found that MMP-3 inhibition or knock-out impaired late-phase LTP in the CA3-CA1 pathway. Interestingly, late-phase LTP was also decreased by MMP-9 blockade. When both MMP-3 and MMP-9 were inhibited, both early- and late-phase LTP was impaired. Using immunoblotting, <i>in situ</i> zymography, and immunofluorescence, we found that LTP induction was associated with an increase in MMP-3 expression and activity in CA1 stratum radiatum. MMP-3 inhibition and knock-out prevented the induction of vdccLTP, with no effect on nmdaLTP. L-type channel-dependent LTP is known to be impaired by hyaluronic acid digestion. We found that slice treatment with hyaluronidase occluded the effect of MMP-3 blockade on LTP, further confirming a critical role for MMP-3 in this form of LTP. In contrast to the CA3-CA1 pathway, LTP in the mossy fiber-CA3 projection did not depend on MMP-3, indicating the pathway specificity of the actions of MMPs. Overall, our study indicates that the activation of perisynaptic MMP-3 supports L-type channel-dependent LTP in the CA1 region, whereas nmdaLTP depends solely on MMP-9.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Various types of long-term potentiation (LTP) are correlated with distinct phases of memory formation and retrieval, but the underlying molecular signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Extracellular proteases have emerged as key players in neuroplasticity phenomena. The present study found that L-type calcium channel-dependent LTP in the CA3-CA1 hippocampal projection is critically regulated by the activity of matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP-3), in contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP regulated by MMP-9. Moreover, the induction of LTP was associated with an increase in MMP-3 expression and activity. Finally, we found that the digestion of hyaluronan, a principal extracellular matrix component, disrupted the MMP-3-dependent component of LTP. These results indicate that distinct MMPs might act as molecular switches for specific types of LTP.</p>

            <p>Visual working memory (VWM) guides behavior by holding a set of active representations and modifying them according to changes in the environment. This updating process relies on a unique mapping between each VWM representation and an actual object in the environment. Here, we destroyed this mapping by either presenting a coherent object but then breaking it into independent parts or presenting an object but then abruptly replacing it with a different object. This allowed us to introduce the neural marker and behavioral consequence of an online resetting process in humans' VWM. Across seven experiments, we demonstrate that this resetting process involves abandoning the old VWM contents because they no longer correspond to the objects in the environment. Then, VWM encodes the novel information and reestablishes the correspondence between the new representations and the objects. The resetting process was marked by a unique neural signature: a sharp drop in the amplitude of the electrophysiological index of VWM contents (the contralateral delay activity), presumably indicating the loss of the existent object-to-representation mappings. This marker was missing when an updating process occurred. Moreover, when tracking moving items, VWM failed to detect salient changes in the object's shape when these changes occurred during the resetting process. This happened despite the object being fully visible, presumably because the mapping between the object and a VWM representation was lost. Importantly, we show that resetting, its neural marker, and the behavioral cost it entails, are specific to situations that involve a destruction of the objects-to-representations correspondence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual working memory (VWM) maintains task-relevant information in an online state. Previous studies showed that VWM representations are accessed and modified after changes in the environment. Here, we show that this updating process critically depends on an ongoing mapping between the representations and the objects in the environment. When this mapping breaks, VWM cannot access the old representations and instead resets. The novel resetting process that we introduce removes the existing representations instead of modifying them and this process is accompanied by a unique neural marker. During the resetting process, VWM was blind to salient changes in the object's shape. The resetting process highlights the flexibility of our cognitive system in handling the dynamic environment by abruptly abandoning irrelevant schemas.</p>

            <p>Why do experimenters give subjects short breaks in long behavioral experiments? Whereas previous studies suggest it is difficult to maintain attention and vigilance over long periods of time, it is unclear precisely what mechanisms benefit from rest after short experimental blocks. Here, we evaluate decline in both perceptual performance and metacognitive sensitivity (i.e., how well confidence ratings track perceptual decision accuracy) over time and investigate whether characteristics of prefrontal cortical areas correlate with these measures. Whereas a single-process signal detection model predicts that these two forms of fatigue should be strongly positively correlated, a dual-process model predicts that rates of decline may dissociate. Here, we show that these measures consistently exhibited negative or near-zero correlations, as if engaged in a trade-off relationship, suggesting that different mechanisms contribute to perceptual and metacognitive decisions. Despite this dissociation, the two mechanisms likely depend on common resources, which could explain their trade-off relationship. Based on structural MRI brain images of individual human subjects, we assessed gray matter volume in the frontal polar area, a region that has been linked to visual metacognition. Variability of frontal polar volume correlated with individual differences in behavior, indicating the region may play a role in supplying common resources for both perceptual and metacognitive vigilance. Additional experiments revealed that reduced metacognitive demand led to superior perceptual vigilance, providing further support for this hypothesis. Overall, results indicate that during breaks between short blocks, it is the higher-level perceptual decision mechanisms, rather than lower-level sensory machinery, that benefit most from rest.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual task performance declines over time (the so-called vigilance decrement), but the relationship between vigilance in perception and metacognition has not yet been explored in depth. Here, we show that patterns in perceptual and metacognitive vigilance do not follow the pattern predicted by a previously suggested single-process model of perceptual and metacognitive decision making. We account for these findings by showing that regions of anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) previously associated with visual metacognition are also associated with perceptual vigilance. We also show that relieving metacognitive task demand improves perceptual vigilance, suggesting that aPFC may house a limited cognitive resource that contributes to both metacognition and perceptual vigilance. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of perceptual metacognition.</p>

            <p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an activity-dependent and persistent increase in synaptic transmission. Currently available techniques to measure LTP are time-intensive and require highly specialized expertise and equipment, and thus are not well suited for screening of multiple candidate treatments, even in animal models. To expand and facilitate the analysis of LTP, here we use a flow cytometry-based method to track chemically induced LTP by detecting surface AMPA receptors in isolated synaptosomes: fluorescence analysis of single-synapse long-term potentiation (FASS-LTP). First, we demonstrate that FASS-LTP is simple, sensitive, and models electrically induced LTP recorded in intact circuitries. Second, we conducted FASS-LTP analysis in two well-characterized Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models (3xTg and Tg2576) and, importantly, in cryopreserved human AD brain samples. By profiling hundreds of synaptosomes, our data provide the first direct evidence to support the idea that synapses from AD brain are intrinsically defective in LTP. Third, we used FASS-LTP for drug evaluation in human synaptosomes. Testing a panel of modulators of cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways, FASS-LTP identified vardenafil and Bay-73–6691 (phosphodiesterase-5 and -9 inhibitors, respectively) as potent enhancers of LTP in synaptosomes from AD cases. These results indicate that our approach could provide the basis for protocols to study LTP in both healthy and diseased human brains, a previously unattainable goal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning and memory depend on the ability of synapses to strengthen in response to activity. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a rapid and persistent increase in synaptic transmission that is thought to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, direct evidence of LTP deficits in human AD brain has been elusive, primarily due to methodological limitations. Here, we analyze LTP in isolated synapses from AD brain using a novel approach that allows testing LTP in cryopreserved brain. Our analysis of hundreds of synapses supports the idea that AD-diseased synapses are intrinsically defective in LTP. Further, we identified pharmacological agents that rescue LTP in AD, thus opening up a new avenue for drug screening and evaluation of strategies for alleviating memory impairments.</p>

            <p>Multivariate pattern analysis is a powerful technique; however, a significant theoretical limitation in neuroscience is the ambiguity in interpreting the source of decodable information used by classifiers. This is exemplified by the continued controversy over the source of orientation decoding from fMRI responses in human V1. Recently Carlson (2014) identified a potential source of decodable information by modeling voxel responses based on the Hubel and Wiesel (1972) ice-cube model of visual cortex. The model revealed that activity associated with the edges of gratings covaries with orientation and could potentially be used to discriminate orientation. Here we empirically evaluate whether "edge-related activity" underlies orientation decoding from patterns of BOLD response in human V1. First, we systematically mapped classifier performance as a function of stimulus location using population receptive field modeling to isolate each voxel's overlap with a large annular grating stimulus. Orientation was decodable across the stimulus; however, peak decoding performance occurred for voxels with receptive fields closer to the fovea and overlapping with the inner edge. Critically, we did not observe the expected second peak in decoding performance at the outer stimulus edge as predicted by the edge account. Second, we evaluated whether voxels that contribute most to classifier performance have receptive fields that cluster in cortical regions corresponding to the retinotopic location of the stimulus edge. Instead, we find the distribution of highly weighted voxels to be approximately random, with a modest bias toward more foveal voxels. Our results demonstrate that edge-related activity is likely not necessary for orientation decoding.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A significant theoretical limitation of multivariate pattern analysis in neuroscience is the ambiguity in interpreting the source of decodable information used by classifiers. For example, orientation can be decoded from BOLD activation patterns in human V1, even though orientation columns are at a finer spatial scale than 3T fMRI. Consequently, the source of decodable information remains controversial. Here we test the proposal that information related to the stimulus edges underlies orientation decoding. We map voxel population receptive fields in V1 and evaluate orientation decoding performance as a function of stimulus location in retinotopic cortex. We find orientation is decodable from voxels whose receptive fields do not overlap with the stimulus edges, suggesting edge-related activity does not substantially drive orientation decoding.</p>

            <p>The neuropeptide galanin has been shown to interact with the opioid system. More specifically, galanin counteracts the behavioral effects of the systemic administration of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. Yet the mechanism responsible for this galanin–opioid interaction has remained elusive. Using biophysical techniques in mammalian transfected cells, we found evidence for selective heteromerization of MOR and the galanin receptor subtype Gal1 (Gal1R). Also in transfected cells, a synthetic peptide selectively disrupted MOR–Gal1R heteromerization as well as specific interactions between MOR and Gal1R ligands: a negative cross talk, by which galanin counteracted MAPK activation induced by the endogenous MOR agonist endomorphin-1, and a cross-antagonism, by which a MOR antagonist counteracted MAPK activation induced by galanin. These specific interactions, which represented biochemical properties of the MOR-Gal1R heteromer, could then be identified <i>in situ</i> in slices of rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) with MAPK activation and two additional cell signaling pathways, AKT and CREB phosphorylation. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis experiments showed that the disruptive peptide selectively counteracted the ability of galanin to block the dendritic dopamine release in the rat VTA induced by local infusion of endomorphin-1, demonstrating a key role of MOR-Gal1R heteromers localized in the VTA in the direct control of dopamine cell function and their ability to mediate antagonistic interactions between MOR and Gal1R ligands. The results also indicate that MOR-Gal1R heteromers should be viewed as targets for the treatment of opioid use disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) localized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a key role in the reinforcing and addictive properties of opioids. With parallel <i>in vitro</i> experiments in mammalian transfected cells and <i>in situ</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rat VTA, we demonstrate that a significant population of these MORs form functional heteromers with the galanin receptor subtype Gal1 (Gal1R), which modulate the activity of the VTA dopaminergic neurons. The MOR-Gal1R heteromer can explain previous results showing antagonistic galanin–opioid interactions and offers a new therapeutic target for the treatment of opioid use disorder.</p>

            <p>GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are the G-protein coupled receptors for the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were shown to associate with homo-oligomers of auxiliary KCTD8, KCTD12, KCTD12b, and KCTD16 subunits (named after their T1 K<sup>+</sup>-channel tetramerization domain) that regulate G-protein signaling of the receptor. Here we provide evidence that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors also associate with hetero-oligomers of KCTD subunits. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that two-thirds of the KCTD16 proteins in the hippocampus of adult mice associate with KCTD12. We show that the KCTD proteins hetero-oligomerize through self-interacting T1 and H1 homology domains. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer measurements in live cells reveal that KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers associate with both the receptor and the G-protein. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers impart unique kinetic properties on G-protein-activated Kir3 currents. During prolonged receptor activation (one min) KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers produce moderately desensitizing fast deactivating K<sup>+</sup> currents, whereas KCTD12 and KCTD16 homo-oligomers produce strongly desensitizing fast deactivating currents and nondesensitizing slowly deactivating currents, respectively. During short activation (2 s) KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers produce nondesensitizing slowly deactivating currents. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons of KCTD knock-out mice are consistent with these findings and indicate that KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers increase the duration of slow IPSCs. In summary, our data demonstrate that simultaneous assembly of distinct KCTDs at the receptor increases the molecular and functional repertoire of native GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and modulates physiologically induced K<sup>+</sup> current responses in the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The KCTD proteins 8, 12, and 16 are auxiliary subunits of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors that differentially regulate G-protein signaling of the receptor. The KCTD proteins are generally assumed to function as homo-oligomers. Here we show that the KCTD proteins also assemble hetero-oligomers in all possible dual combinations. Experiments in live cells demonstrate that KCTD hetero-oligomers form at least tetramers and that these tetramers directly interact with the receptor and the G-protein. KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers impart unique kinetic properties to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-induced Kir3 currents in heterologous cells. KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers are abundant in the hippocampus, where they prolong the duration of slow IPSCs in pyramidal cells. Our data therefore support that KCTD hetero-oligomers modulate physiologically induced K<sup>+</sup> current responses in the brain.</p>

            <p>Nonhuman primate neuroanatomical studies have identified a cortical pathway from the superior temporal sulcus (STS) projecting into dorsal subregions of the amygdala, but whether this same pathway exists in humans is unknown. Here, we addressed this question by combining theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) with fMRI to test the prediction that the STS and amygdala are functionally connected during face perception. Human participants (<i>N</i> = 17) were scanned, over two sessions, while viewing 3 s video clips of moving faces, bodies, and objects. During these sessions, TBS was delivered over the face-selective right posterior STS (rpSTS) or over the vertex control site. A region-of-interest analysis revealed results consistent with our hypothesis. Namely, TBS delivered over the rpSTS reduced the neural response to faces (but not to bodies or objects) in the rpSTS, right anterior STS (raSTS), and right amygdala, compared with TBS delivered over the vertex. By contrast, TBS delivered over the rpSTS did not significantly reduce the neural response to faces in the right fusiform face area or right occipital face area. This pattern of results is consistent with the existence of a cortico-amygdala pathway in humans for processing face information projecting from the rpSTS, via the raSTS, into the amygdala. This conclusion is consistent with nonhuman primate neuroanatomy and with existing face perception models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuroimaging studies have identified multiple face-selective regions in the brain, but the functional connections between these regions are unknown. In the present study, participants were scanned with fMRI while viewing movie clips of faces, bodies, and objects before and after transient disruption of the face-selective right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS). Results showed that TBS disruption reduced the neural response to faces, but not to bodies or objects, in the rpSTS, right anterior STS (raSTS), and right amygdala. These results are consistent with the existence of a cortico-amygdala pathway in humans for processing face information projecting from the rpSTS, via the raSTS, into the amygdala.

            <p>Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a critical component of innate immune signaling and has been implicated in alcohol responses in preclinical and clinical models. Members of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA-Neuroimmune) consortium tested the hypothesis that TLR4 mediates excessive ethanol drinking using the following models: (1) <i>Tlr4</i> knock-out (KO) rats, (2) selective knockdown of <i>Tlr4</i> mRNA in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), and (3) injection of the TLR4 antagonist (+)-naloxone in mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreased food/water intake and body weight in ethanol-naive and ethanol-trained wild-type (WT), but not <i>Tlr4</i> KO rats. There were no consistent genotypic differences in two-bottle choice chronic ethanol intake or operant self-administration in rats before or after dependence. In mice, (+)-naloxone did not decrease drinking-in-the-dark and only modestly inhibited dependence-driven consumption at the highest dose. <i>Tlr4</i> knockdown in mouse NAc did not decrease drinking in the two-bottle choice continuous or intermittent access tests. However, the latency to ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex increased and the duration decreased in KO versus WT rats. In rat central amygdala neurons, deletion of <i>Tlr4</i> altered GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function, but not GABA release. Although there were no genotype differences in acute ethanol effects before or after chronic intermittent ethanol exposure, genotype differences were observed after LPS exposure. Using different species and sexes, different methods to inhibit TLR4 signaling, and different ethanol consumption tests, our comprehensive studies indicate that TLR4 may play a role in ethanol-induced sedation and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function, but does not regulate excessive drinking directly and would not be an effective therapeutic target.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key mediator of innate immune signaling and has been implicated in alcohol responses in animal models and human alcoholics. Members of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA-Neuroimmune) consortium participated in the first comprehensive study across multiple laboratories to test the hypothesis that TLR4 regulates excessive alcohol consumption in different species and different models of chronic, dependence-driven, and binge-like drinking. Although TLR4 was not a critical determinant of excessive drinking, it was important in the acute sedative effects of alcohol. Current research efforts are directed at determining which neuroimmune pathways mediate excessive alcohol drinking and these findings will help to prioritize relevant pathways and potential therapeutic targets.</p>

            Cerebellar volume abnormalities have been often suggested as a possible endophenotype for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We aimed at objectifying this possible alteration by performing a systematic meta-analysis of the literature, and an analysis of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) cohort. Our meta-analysis sought to determine a combined effect size of ASD diagnosis on different measures of the cerebellar anatomy, as well as the effect of possible factors of variability across studies. We then analysed the cerebellar volume of 328 patients and 353 controls from the ABIDE project. The meta-analysis of the literature suggested a weak but significant association between ASD diagnosis and increased cerebellar volume (p=0.049, uncorrected), but the analysis of ABIDE did not show any relationship. The studies in the literature were generally underpowered, however, the number of statistically significant findings was larger than expected. Although we could not provide a conclusive explanation for this excess of significant findings, our analyses would suggest publication bias as a possible reason. Finally, age, sex and IQ were important sources of cerebellar volume variability, however, independent of autism diagnosis.

            Sleep is an ancient animal behavior that is regulated similarly in species ranging from flies to mammals. Various genes that regulate sleep have been identified in invertebrates, but whether the functions of these genes are conserved in mammals remains poorly explored. Drosophila insomniac (inc) mutants exhibit severely shortened and fragmented sleep. Inc protein physically associates with the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase, and neuronal depletion of Inc or Cul3 strongly curtails sleep, suggesting that Inc is a Cul3 adaptor that directs the ubiquitination of neuronal substrates that regulate sleep. Three proteins similar to Inc exist in vertebrates - KCTD2, KCTD5, and KCTD17 - but are uncharacterized within the nervous system and their functional conservation with Inc has not been addressed. Here we show that Inc and its mouse orthologs exhibit striking biochemical and functional interchangeability within Cul3 complexes. Remarkably, KCTD2 and KCTD5 restore sleep to inc mutants, indicating that they can substitute for Inc in vivo and engage its neuronal targets that impact sleep. Inc and its orthologs traffic similarly within fly and mammalian neurons and are present at synapses, suggesting that their substrates include synaptic proteins. Consistent with such a mechanism, inc mutants exhibit defects in synaptic structure and physiology, indicating that Inc is vital for both synaptic function and sleep. Our findings reveal that molecular functions of Inc are conserved through ~600 million years of evolution and support the hypothesis that Inc and its orthologs participate in an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitination pathway that links synaptic function and sleep regulation.

            While red-shifted channelrhodopsin has been shown to be highly effective in activating CNS neurons in freely moving Drosophila, there were no existing high-throughput tools for closed-loop, behavior-dependent optogenetic stimulation of Drosophila. Here, we present SkinnerTrax to fill this void. SkinnerTrax stimulates individual flies promptly in response to their being at specific positions or performing specific actions. Importantly, SkinnerTrax was designed for and achieves significant throughput with simple and inexpensive components.

            <p>by Stuart P. Wilson</p>

A thermodynamic model of thermoregulatory huddling interactions between endotherms is developed. The model is presented as a Monte Carlo algorithm in which animals are iteratively exchanged between groups, with a probability of exchanging groups defined in terms of the temperature of the environment and the body temperatures of the animals. The temperature-dependent exchange of animals between groups is shown to reproduce a second-order critical phase transition, i.e., a smooth switch to huddling when the environment gets colder, as measured in recent experiments. A peak in the rate at which group sizes change, referred to as pup flow, is predicted at the critical temperature of the phase transition, consistent with a thermodynamic description of huddling, and with a description of the huddle as a self-organising system. The model was subjected to a simple evolutionary procedure, by iteratively substituting the physiologies of individuals that fail to balance the costs of thermoregulation (by huddling in groups) with the costs of thermogenesis (by contributing heat). The resulting tension between cooperative and competitive interactions was found to generate a phenomenon called self-organised criticality, as evidenced by the emergence of avalanches in fitness that propagate across many generations. The emergence of avalanches reveals how huddling can introduce correlations in fitness between individuals and thereby constrain evolutionary dynamics. Finally, a full agent-based model of huddling interactions is also shown to generate criticality when subjected to the same evolutionary pressures. The agent-based model is related to the Monte Carlo model in the way that a Vicsek model is related to an Ising model in statistical physics. Huddling therefore presents an opportunity to use thermodynamic theory to study an emergent adaptive animal behaviour. In more general terms, huddling is proposed as an ideal system for investigating the interaction between self-organisation and natural selection empirically.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPTGw-hy7-U" width="1" />

            <p>by Max Hinne, Annet Meijers, Rembrandt Bakker, Paul H. E. Tiesinga, Morten Mørup, Marcel A. J. van Gerven</p>

Our understanding of the wiring map of the brain, known as the <i>connectome</i>, has increased greatly in the last decade, mostly due to technological advancements in neuroimaging techniques and improvements in computational tools to interpret the vast amount of available data. Despite this, with the exception of the <i>C. elegans</i> roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied <i>ex vivo</i>. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a ‘latent space model’ that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque, where we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two baselines and an alternative model in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex. Finally, our probabilistic approach enables us to make explicit which connections are easy to predict and which prove difficult, allowing for informed follow-up studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6qgwyKHJI5E" width="1" />

            <p>by Te Wu, Long Wang, Feng Fu</p>

Phenotypic diversity is considered beneficial to the evolution of contingent cooperation, in which cooperators channel their help preferentially towards others of similar phenotypes. However, it remains largely unclear how phenotypic variation arises in the first place and thus leads to the construction of phenotypic complexity. Here we propose a mathematical model to study the coevolutionary dynamics of phenotypic diversity and contingent cooperation. Unlike previous models, our model does not assume any prescribed level of phenotypic diversity, but rather lets it be an evolvable trait. Each individual expresses one phenotype at a time and only the phenotypes expressed are visible to others. Moreover, individuals can differ in their potential of phenotypic variation, which is characterized by the number of distinct phenotypes they can randomly switch to. Each individual incurs a cost proportional to the number of potentially expressible phenotypes so as to retain phenotypic variation and expression. Our results show that phenotypic diversity coevolves with contingent cooperation under a wide range of conditions and that there exists an optimal level of phenotypic diversity best promoting contingent cooperation. It pays for contingent cooperators to elevate their potential of phenotypic variation, thereby increasing their opportunities of establishing cooperation via novel phenotypes, as these new phenotypes serve as secret tags that are difficult for defector to discover and chase after. We also find that evolved high levels of phenotypic diversity can occasionally collapse due to the invasion of defector mutants, suggesting that cooperation and phenotypic diversity can mutually reinforce each other. Thus, our results provide new insights into better understanding the coevolution of cooperation and phenotypic diversity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hraP-hDvC8w" width="1" />

            <p>by Cox Lwaka Tamba, Yuan-Li Ni, Yuan-Ming Zhang</p>

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) entails examining a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a limited sample with hundreds of individuals, implying a variable selection problem in the high dimensional dataset. Although many single-locus GWAS approaches under polygenic background and population structure controls have been widely used, some significant loci fail to be detected. In this study, we used an iterative modified-sure independence screening (ISIS) approach in reducing the number of SNPs to a moderate size. Expectation-Maximization (EM)-Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BLASSO) was used to estimate all the selected SNP effects for true quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) detection. This method is referred to as ISIS EM-BLASSO algorithm. Monte Carlo simulation studies validated the new method, which has the highest empirical power in QTN detection and the highest accuracy in QTN effect estimation, and it is the fastest, as compared with efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). To further demonstrate the new method, six flowering time traits in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were re-analyzed by four methods (New method, EMMA, FarmCPU, and mrMLM). As a result, the new method identified most previously reported genes. Therefore, the new method is a good alternative for multi-locus GWAS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QHSi3mOTCCk" width="1" />

            <p>by Richard John Wheeler</p>

Swimming cells typically move along a helical path or undergo longitudinal rotation as they swim, arising from chiral asymmetry in hydrodynamic drag or propulsion bending the swimming path into a helix. Helical paths are beneficial for some forms of chemotaxis, but why asymmetric shape is so prevalent when a symmetric shape would also allow highly directional swimming is unclear. Here, I analyse the swimming of the insect life cycle stages of two human parasites; <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> and <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>. This showed quantitatively how chirality in <i>T</i>. <i>brucei</i> cell shape confers highly directional swimming. High speed videomicrographs showed that <i>T</i>. <i>brucei</i>, <i>L</i>. <i>mexicana</i> and a <i>T</i>. <i>brucei</i> RNAi morphology mutant have a range of shape asymmetries, from wild-type <i>T</i>. <i>brucei</i> (highly chiral) to <i>L</i>. <i>mexicana</i> (near-axial symmetry). The chiral cells underwent longitudinal rotation while swimming, with more rapid longitudinal rotation correlating with swimming path directionality. Simulation indicated hydrodynamic drag on the chiral cell shape caused rotation, and the predicted geometry of the resulting swimming path matched the directionality of the observed swimming paths. This simulation of swimming path geometry showed that highly chiral cell shape is a robust mechanism through which microscale swimmers can achieve highly directional swimming at low Reynolds number. It is insensitive to random variation in shape or propulsion (biological noise). Highly symmetric cell shape can give highly directional swimming but is at risk of giving futile circular swimming paths in the presence of biological noise. This suggests the chiral <i>T</i>. <i>brucei</i> cell shape (associated with the lateral attachment of the flagellum) may be an adaptation associated with the bloodstream-inhabiting lifestyle of this parasite for robust highly directional swimming. It also provides a plausible general explanation for why swimming cells tend to have strong asymmetries in cell shape or propulsion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_D8_XNWlQg8" width="1" />

            The endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus Leishmaniavirus (LRV1) has been implicated as a pathogenicity factor for leishmaniasis in rodent models and human disease, and associated with drug-treatment failures in Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania guyanensis infections. Thus, methods targeting LRV1 could have therapeutic benefit. Here we screened a panel of antivirals...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/At3Ai4sCNig" width="1" />

            In most natural infections or after recovery, small numbers of Leishmania parasites remain indefinitely in the host.

            <p>Optimal decision-making requires balancing fast but error-prone and more accurate but slower decisions through adjustments of decision thresholds. Here, we demonstrate two distinct correlates of such speed-accuracy adjustments by recording subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity and electroencephalography in 11 Parkinson’s disease patients during a perceptual decision-making task; STN low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity (2–8 Hz), coupled to activity at prefrontal electrode Fz, and STN beta activity (13–30 Hz) coupled to electrodes C3/C4 close to motor cortex. These two correlates differed not only in their cortical topography and spectral characteristics but also in the relative timing of recruitment and in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. Increases of STN LFO power preceding the response predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while cue-induced reductions of STN beta power decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions. These findings indicate that distinct neural mechanisms determine whether a decision will be made in haste or with caution.</p>

            <p>Pharmacological targeting of transcription factors holds great promise for the development of new therapeutics, but strategies based on blockade of DNA binding, nuclear shuttling, or individual protein partner recruitment have yielded limited success to date. Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics.</p>

            <p>Desmoplasia, a fibrotic mass including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and self-sustaining extracellular matrix (D-ECM), is a puzzling feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs). Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGFβ is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced naïve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool.</p>

            <p>For group-living animals traveling through heterogeneous landscapes, collective movement can be influenced by both habitat structure and social interactions. Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence – baboons’ preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed – is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop’s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination.</p>

            <p>Mutations in the synaptic gene <em>SHANK3</em> lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a <em>Shank3</em>-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that <em>Shank3</em>-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS.</p>

            It is said that we lose track of time - that "time flies" - when we are engrossed in a story. How does engagement with the story cause this distorted perception of time, and what are its neural correlates? People commit both time and attentional resources to an engaging stimulus. For narrative videos, attentional engagement can be represented as the level of similarity between the electroencephalographic responses of different viewers. Here we show that this measure of neural engagement predicted the duration of time that viewers were willing to commit to narrative videos. Contrary to popular wisdom, engagement did not distort the average perception of time duration. Rather, more similar brain responses resulted in a more uniform perception of time across viewers. These findings suggest that by capturing the attention of an audience, narrative videos bring both neural processing and the subjective perception of time into synchrony.

            Computational neuroscience is, to first order, dominated by two approaches: the "bottom-up" approach, which searches for statistical patterns in large-scale neural recordings, and the "top-down" approach, which begins with a theory of computation and considers plausible neural implementations. While this division is not clear-cut, we argue that these approaches should be much more intimately linked. From a Bayesian perspective, computational theories provide constrained prior distributions on neural data---albeit highly sophisticated ones. By connecting theory to observation via a probabilistic model, we provide the link necessary to test, evaluate, and revise our theories in a data-driven and statistically rigorous fashion. This review highlights examples of this theory-driven pipeline for neural data analysis in recent literature and illustrates it with a worked example based on the temporal difference learning model of dopamine.

            In the mammalian neocortex, there is a high diversity of neuronal types. To facilitate construction of system models with multiple cell types, we generate a database of point models associated with the Allen Cell Types Database. We construct a series of generalized integrate-and-fire (GLIF) models of increasing complexity aiming to reproduce the spiking behaviors of the recorded neurons. We test the performance of these GLIF models on data from 771 neurons from 14 transgenic lines, with increasing model performance for more complex models. To answer how complex a model needs to be to reproduce the number of electrophysiological cell types, we perform unsupervised clustering on the parameters extracted from these models. The number of clusters is smaller for individual model types, but when combining all GLIF parameters 18 clusters are obtained, while 11 clusters are obtained using 16 electrophysiological features. Therefore, these low dimensional models have the capacity to characterize the diversity of cell types without the need for a priori defined features.

            Network science has emerged as a powerful tool through which we can study the higher- order architectural properties of the world around us. How human learners exploit this information remains an essential question. Here, we focus on the temporal constraints that govern such a process. Participants viewed a continuous sequence of images generated by three distinct walks on a modular network. Walks varied along two critical dimensions: their predictability and the density with which they sampled from communities of images. Learners exposed to walks that richly sampled from each community exhibited a sharp increase in processing time upon entry into a new community. This effect was eliminated in a highly regular walk that sampled exhaustively from images in short, successive cycles (i.e., that increasingly minimized uncertainty about the nature of upcoming stimuli). These results demonstrate that temporal organization plays an essential role in how robustly knowledge of network architecture is acquired.

            <p>by Ho-Yon Hwang, Jiou Wang</p>

Genetic diversity is maintained by continuing generation and removal of variants. While examining over 800,000 DNA variants in wild isolates of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we made a discovery that the proportions of variant types are not constant across the <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> genome. The variant proportion is defined as the fraction of a specific variant type (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or indel) within a broader set of variants (e.g. all variants or all non-SNPs). The proportions of most variant types show a correlation with the recombination rate. These correlations can be explained as a result of a concerted action of two mutation mechanisms, which we named Morgan and Sanger mechanisms. The two proposed mechanisms act according to the distinct components of recombination rate, specifically the genetic and physical distance. Regression analysis was used to explore the characteristics and contributions of the two mutation mechanisms. According to our model, ~20–40% of all mutations in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> wild populations are derived from programmed meiotic double strand breaks, which precede chromosomal crossovers and thus may be the point of origin for the Morgan mechanism. A substantial part of the known correlation between the recombination rate and variant distribution appears to be caused by the mutations generated by the Morgan mechanism. Mathematically integrating the mutation model with background selection model gives a more complete depiction of how the variant landscape is shaped in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. Similar analysis should be possible in other species by examining the correlation between the recombination rate and variant landscape within the context of our mutation model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rkON7vinP5s" width="1" />

Two basic physical inputs that are crucial for understanding the structure of the 30-nm fiber are the stiffness of the linker DNA and the relative orientations of the DNA entering/exiting nucleosomes. Based on these inputs we simulate chromatin structure and show that the presence of non-histone proteins, which bind and locally bend linker DNA, destroys any regular higher order structures (e.g., zig-zag). Accounting for the bending geometry of proteins like nhp6 and HMG-B, our theory predicts phase-diagram for the chromatin structure as a function of DNA-bending non-histone protein density and mean linker DNA length. For a wide range of linker lengths, we show that as we vary one parameter, that is, the fraction of bent linker region due to non-histone proteins, the steady-state structure will show a transition from zig-zag to an irregular structure—a structure that is reminiscent of what is observed in experiments recently. Our theory can explain the recent <i>in vivo</i> observation of irregular chromatin having co-existence of finite fraction of the next-neighbor (<i>i</i> + 2) and neighbor (<i>i</i> + 1) nucleosome interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/weCLwPHJltI" width="1" />

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective.</b> To characterize <em>in vivo</em> signatures of pathological diagnosis in a large cohort of patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants defined by current diagnostic classification.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods.</b> Extensive clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data were collected from 69 patients with sporadic PPA, divided into 29 semantic (svPPA), 25 non-fluent (nfvPPA), 11 logopenic (lvPPA), and 4 mixed PPA. Patterns of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy at presentation were assessed and tested as predictors of pathological diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results.</b> A clinical diagnosis of PPA was associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP inclusions in 40.5%, FTLD-tau in 40.5%, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in 19% of cases. Each variant was associated with one typical pathology: 24/29 (83%) svPPA showed FTLD-TDP type C, 22/25 (88%) nfvPPA showed FTLD-tau, and all 11 lvPPA had AD. Within FTLD-tau, 4R-tau pathology was commonly associated with nfvPPA, whereas Pick's disease was observed in a minority of subjects across all variants except for lvPPA. Compared with pathologically typical cases, svPPA-tau showed significant extrapyramidal signs, greater executive impairment, and severe striatal and frontal GM and WM atrophy. nfvPPA-TDP patients lacked general motor symptoms or significant WM atrophy. Combining GM and WM volumes, SVM analysis showed 92.7% accuracy to distinguish FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP pathologies across variants.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation.</b> Each PPA clinical variant is associated with a typical and most frequent cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological profile.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: We sought to identify genetic causes of early onset epileptic encephalopathies with burst suppression (Ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic encephalopathy) and evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We enrolled 33 patients with a referral diagnosis of Ohtahara syndrome or early myoclonic encephalopathy without malformations of cortical development. We performed detailed phenotypic assessment including seizure presentation, EEG, and MRI. We confirmed burst suppression in 28 out of 33 patients. Research-based exome sequencing was performed for patients without a previously identified molecular diagnosis from clinical evaluation or research-based epilepsy gene panel.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: In 17/28 (61%) patients with confirmed early burst suppression, we identified variants predicted to be pathogenic in <em>KCNQ2</em> (n=10), <em>STXBP1</em> (n=2), <em>SCN2A</em> (n=2), <em>PNPO</em> (n=1), <em>PIGA</em> (n=1), and <em>SEPSECS</em> (n=1). In 3/5 (60%) patients without confirmed early burst suppression, we identified variants predicted to be pathogenic in <em>STXBP1</em> (n=2) and <em>SCN2A</em> (n=1). The patient with the homozygous <em>PNPO</em> variant had a low CSF pyridoxal-5-phosphate level. Otherwise, no early laboratory or clinical features distinguished the cases associated with pathogenic variants in specific genes from each other or from those with no prior genetic cause identified.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: We characterize the genetic landscape of epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression, without brain malformations, and demonstrate feasibility of genetic diagnosis with clinically available testing in over 60% of our cohort with <em>KCNQ2</em> implicated in one third. This electroclinical syndrome is associated with pathogenic variation in <em>SEPSECS</em>. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

            <p>A high density of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes of Ranvier is necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation in myelinated axons. Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na<sup>+</sup> channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires axonal βII spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton.</p>

            <p>The joints of mammals are lined with cartilage, comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in a specialized extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes.</p>

            <p>Adult-born neurons are continually produced in the dentate gyrus but it is unclear whether synaptic integration of new neurons affects the pre-existing circuit. Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene <em>Bax</em> in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that <em>Bax</em> deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.</p>

            <p>The high levels of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues within the Presenilin 1 (PS1) N-terminus and in the large hydrophilic loop region suggest that the enzymatic function of PS1/γ-secretase can be modulated by its ‘phosphorylated’ and ‘dephosphorylated’ states. However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation, and resulting increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.</p>

            <p>A large number of drugs can induce prolongation of cardiac repolarization and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (<em>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C</em>, <em>CAMKV</em>) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions.</p>

            <div class="para"><p>Central nervous system infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) is increasingly detected by blood-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Despite this, there are no standardized diagnostic criteria, and the clinical–radiological spectrum, causes, and optimum investigation strategy are not established. We reviewed clinical and radiological details of patients with iSS assessed at a specialist neurological center during 2004–2016 using predefined standardized radiological criteria. All imaging findings were rated blinded to clinical details. We identified 65 patients with iSS, whom we classified into 2 groups: type 1 (classical) and type 2 (secondary) iSS. Type 1 (classical) iSS included 48 patients without any potentially causal radiologically confirmed single spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, of whom 39 (83%) had hearing loss, ataxia, or myelopathy; type 2 (secondary) iSS included 17 patients with a potentially causal radiologically confirmed spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, of whom none had hearing loss, ataxia, or myelopathy. Of the patients with type 1 (classical) iSS, 40 (83%) had a potentially causal cranial or spinal dural abnormality, 5 (11%) had an alternative cause, and 3 (6%) had no cause identified. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography did not identify any underlying causal lesions for type 1 iSS. Type 1 (classical) iSS, defined using simple radiological criteria, is associated with a characteristic neurological syndrome. Rational investigation, including spinal MRI, nearly always reveals a potential cause, most often a dural abnormality. Catheter angiography appears to be unhelpful, suggesting that classical iSS is not associated with macrovascular arterial pathology. Recognition of type 1 (classical) iSS should allow timely diagnosis and early consideration of treatment. Ann Neurol 2017</p></div>

            <div class="para"><p>Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated1 (LGI1) encephalitis is an antibody-associated inflammation of the limbic area. An autoimmune etiology is suspected but not yet proven. We performed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis in 25 nontumor anti-LGI1 patients and discovered a remarkably strong HLA association. HLA-DR7 was present in 88% compared to 19.6% in healthy controls (<em>p</em> = 4.1 × 10<sup>−11</sup>). HLA-DRB4 was present in all patients and in 46.5% controls (<em>p</em> = 1.19 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). These findings support the autoimmune hypothesis. An exploratory analysis was performed in a small group of 4 tumor-LGI1 patients. The strong HLA association seems not applicable in these patients. Therefore, the absence of HLA-DR7 or HLA-DRB4 could raise tumor suspicion in anti-LGI1 patients. Ann Neurol 2016</p></div>

            <p>Nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulators and potent oncoproteins, YAP/TAZ, is considered necessary for adult tissue homeostasis. Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue.</p>

            <div class="para"><p>Recent advances in the understanding of neuropathogenesis associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has led to descriptions of neonatal microcephaly cases. However, none of these reports have evaluated the humoral response during ZIKV infection. We report here polyfunctional immune activation associated with increased interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractive protein 1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels in the amniotic fluid of ZIKV-positive pregnant women with neonatal microcephaly. These cytokines have been associated not only with neuronal damage, but also with differentiation and proliferation of neural progenitor cells. Our results suggested that the immune activation caused by ZIKV infection in the uterine environment could also interfere with fetal development. ANN NEUROL 2017;81:152–156</p></div>

It remains poorly treated with current analgesics. Ciguatoxins (CTXs), ichthyosarcotoxins that cause ciguatera, produce a large peripheral sensitization to dynamic cold stimuli in Aδ-fibers by activating sodium channels without producing heat or mechanical allodynia. We used CTXs as a surrogate model of cold allodynia to dissect the framework of cold allodynia–activated central pain pathways.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24841-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Reversible cold allodynia was induced in healthy male volunteers by shallow intracutaneous injection of low millimolar concentrations of CTX into the dorsal skin of the forefoot. Cold and warm stimuli were delivered to the treated and the control site using a Peltier-driven thermotest device. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired with a 3T MRI scanner using a blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) protocol.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24841-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The CTX-induced substantial peripheral sensitization to cooling stimuli in Aδ-fibers is particularly retrieved in BOLD changes due to dynamic temperature changes and less during constant cooling. Brain areas that responded during cold allodynia were almost always located bilaterally and appeared in the medial insula, medial cingulate cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, frontal areas, and cerebellum. Whereas these areas also produced changes in BOLD signal during the dynamic warming stimulus on the control site, they remained silent during the warming stimuli on the injected site.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24841-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>We describe the defining feature of the cold allodynia pain percept in the human brain and illustrate why ciguatera sufferers often report a perceptual temperature reversal.

            <div class="section" id="ana24834-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a negative prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with permanent shunt dependency in a substantial proportion of patients post-ICH. IVH treatment by intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) was recently linked to reduced mortality rates in the CLEAR III study and IVF represents a safe and effective strategy to hasten clot resolution that may reduce shunt rates. Additionally, promising results from observational studies reported reductions in shunt dependency for a combined treatment approach of IVF plus lumbar drains (LDs). The present randomized, controlled trial investigated efficacy and safety of a combined strategy—IVF plus LD versus IVF alone—on shunt dependency in patients with ICH and severe IVH.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24834-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study included patients aged 18 to 85 years, prehospital modified Rankin Scale ≤3, ICH volume &lt; 60ml, Glasgow Coma Scale of &lt;9, and severe IVH with tamponade of the third and fourth ventricles requiring placement of external ventricular drainage (EVD). Over a 3-year recruitment period, patients were allocated to either standard treatment (control group receiving IVF consisting of 1mg of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator every 8 hours until clot clearance of third and fourth ventricles) or a combined treatment approach of IVF and—upon clot clearance of third and fourth ventricles—subsequent placement of an LD for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; intervention group). The primary endpoint consisted of permanent shunt placement indicated after a total of three unsuccessful EVD clamping attempts or need for CSF drainage longer than 14 days in both groups. Secondary endpoints included IVF- and LD-related safety, such as bleeding or infections, and functional outcome at 90 and 180 days. Conducted endpoint analyses used individual patient data meta-analyses. The study was registered at <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" title="Link to external resource: http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a> (NCT01041950).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24834-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The trial was stopped upon predefined interim analysis after 30 patients because of significant efficacy of tested intervention. The primary endpoint was analyzed without dropouts and was reached in 43% (7 of 16) of the control group versus 0% (0 of 14) of the intervention group (<em>p</em> = 0.007). Meta-analyses were based on overall 97 patients, 45 patients receiving IVF plus LD versus 42 with IVF only. Meta-analyses on shunt dependency showed an absolute risk reduction of 24% for the intervention (LD, 2.2% [1 of 45] vs no-LD, 26.2% [11 of 42]; odds ratio [OR] = 0.062; confidence interval [CI], 0.011–0.361; <em>p</em> = 0.002). Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences for CSF infections (OR = 0.869;CI, 0.445–1.695; <em>p</em> = 0.680) and functional outcome at 90 days (OR = 0.478; CI, 0.190–1.201; <em>p</em> = 0.116), yet bleeding complications were significantly reduced in favor of the intervention (OR = 0.401; CI, 0.302–0.532; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24834-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>The present trial and individual patient data meta-analyses provide evidence that, in patients with severe IVH, as compared to IVF alone, a combined approach of IVF plus LD treatment is feasible and safe and significantly reduces rates of permanent shunt dependency for aresorptive hydrocephalus post-ICH.

            <div class="section" id="ana24845-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Freezing of gait is a disabling symptom in Parkinson disease and related disorders, but the brain regions involved in symptom generation remain unclear. Here we analyze brain lesions causing acute onset freezing of gait to identify regions causally involved in symptom generation.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24845-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Fourteen cases of lesion-induced freezing of gait were identified from the literature, and lesions were mapped to a common brain atlas. Because lesion-induced symptoms can come from sites connected to the lesion location, not just the lesion location itself, we also identified brain regions functionally connected to each lesion location. This technique, termed lesion network mapping, has been recently shown to identify regions involved in symptom generation across a variety of lesion-induced disorders.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24845-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Lesion location was heterogeneous, and no single region could be considered necessary for symptom generation. However, &gt; 90% (13 of 14) of lesions were functionally connected to a focal area in the dorsal medial cerebellum. This cerebellar area overlapped previously recognized regions that are activated by locomotor tasks, termed the cerebellar locomotor region. Connectivity to this region was specific to lesions causing freezing of gait compared to lesions causing other movement disorders (hemichorea or asterixis).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24845-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Lesions causing freezing of gait are located within a common functional network characterized by connectivity to the cerebellar locomotor region.

            <div class="para"><p>Here, we report the structural evidence of cerebral white matter abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) patients and the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical disability. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in CMT patients with demyelinating (CMT1A/CMT1E), axonal (CMT2A/CMT2E), or intermediate (CMTX1/DI-CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Although all patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, all genetic subgroups except CMT1A had abnormal DTI findings indicative of significant cerebral white matter abnormalities: decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, and increased radial diffusivity. DTI abnormalities were correlated with clinical disability, suggesting that there is comorbidity of central nervous system damage with peripheral neuropathy in CMT patients.

<div class="section" id="ana24844-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The three subjects exhibited [F-18]-AV-1451 <em>in vivo</em> retention predominantly in basal ganglia and midbrain. Neuropathological examination confirmed the PSP diagnosis in the first two subjects; the <em>MAPT</em> P301L mutation carrier had an atypical tauopathy characterized by grain-like tau-containing neurites in gray and white matter with heaviest burden in basal ganglia. In all three cases, autoradiography failed to show detectable [F-18]-AV-1451 binding in multiple brain regions examined, with the exception of entorhinal cortex (reflecting incidental age-related neurofibrillary tangles) and neuromelanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra (off-target binding). The lack of a consistent significant correlation between <em>in vivo</em> [F-18]-AV-1541 retention and postmortem <em>in vitro</em> binding and tau measures in these cases suggests that this ligand has low affinity for tau lesions primarily made of straight tau filaments.</p></div></div>

            <p>We lack detailed knowledge about the spatio-temporal physiological signatures of REM sleep, especially in humans. By analyzing intracranial electrode data from humans, we demonstrate for the first time that there are prominent beta (15–35 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations in both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the DLPFC during REM sleep. We further show that these theta and beta activities in the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant but reciprocally connected regions, are coherent. These findings suggest that, counter to current prevailing thought, the DLPFC is active during REM sleep and likely interacting with other areas. Since the DLPFC and the ACC are implicated in memory and emotional regulation, and the ACC has motor areas and is thought to be important for error detection, the dialogue between these two areas could play a role in the regulation of emotions and in procedural motor and emotional memory consolidation.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a new framework for analyzing cross-frequency coupling in multichannel electrophysiological recordings. The generalized eigendecomposition-based cross-frequency coupling framework (gedCFC) is inspired by source-separation algorithms combined with dynamics of mesoscopic neurophysiological processes. It is unaffected by factors that confound traditional CFC methods—such as non-stationarities, non-sinusoidality, and non-uniform phase angle distributions—attractive properties considering that brain activity is neither stationary nor perfectly sinusoidal. The gedCFC framework opens new opportunities for conceptualizing CFC as network interactions with diverse spatial/topographical distributions. Five specific methods within the gedCFC framework are detailed, these are validated in simulated data and applied in several empirical datasets. gedCFC accurately recovers physiologically plausible CFC patterns embedded in noise that causes traditional CFC methods to perform poorly. The paper also demonstrates that spike-field coherence in multichannel local field potential data can be analyzed using the gedCFC framework, which provides significant advantages over traditional spike-field coherence analyses. Null-hypothesis testing is also discussed.</p>

            <p>Animal behavior is directed by the integration of sensory information from internal states and the environment. Neuroendocrine regulation of diverse behaviors of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> is under the control of the DAF-7/TGF-β ligand that is secreted from sensory neurons. Here, we show that <em>C. elegans</em> males exhibit an altered, male-specific expression pattern of <em>daf-7</em> in the ASJ sensory neuron pair with the onset of reproductive maturity, which functions to promote male-specific mate-searching behavior. Molecular genetic analysis of the switch-like regulation of <em>daf-7</em> expression in the ASJ neuron pair reveals a hierarchy of regulation among multiple inputs—sex, age, nutritional status, and microbial environment—which function in the modulation of behavior. Our results suggest that regulation of gene expression in sensory neurons can function in the integration of a wide array of sensory information and facilitate decision-making behaviors in <em>C. elegans</em>.</p>

            <p>Simultaneous stimulation of the antennal lobes (ALs) and the ascending fibers of the ventral nerve cord (AFV), two sensory inputs to the mushroom bodies (MBs), induces long-term enhancement (LTE) of subsequent AL-evoked MB responses. LTE induction requires activation of at least three signaling pathways to the MBs, mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), NMDA receptors (NRs), and D1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs). Here, we demonstrate that inputs from the AL are transmitted to the MBs through nAChRs, and inputs from the AFV are transmitted by NRs. Dopamine signaling occurs downstream of both nAChR and NR activation, and requires simultaneous stimulation of both pathways. Dopamine release requires the activity of the rutabaga adenylyl cyclase in postsynaptic MB neurons, and release is restricted to MB neurons that receive coincident stimulation. Our results indicate that postsynaptic activity can gate presynaptic dopamine release to regulate plasticity.</p>

            <p>Dyslexia is a prevalent reading disability whose underlying mechanisms are still disputed. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics’ shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise.</p>

            <p>The Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters (NSSs) represent an important class of proteins mediating sodium-dependent uptake of neurotransmitters from the extracellular space. The substrate binding stoichiometry of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, and thus the principal transport mechanism, has been heavily debated. Here we used solid state NMR to specifically characterize the bound leucine ligand and probe the number of binding sites in LeuT. We were able to produce high-quality NMR spectra of substrate bound to microcrystalline LeuT samples and identify one set of sodium-dependent substrate-specific chemical shifts. Furthermore, our data show that the binding site mutants F253A and L400S, which probe the major S1 binding site and the proposed S2 binding site, respectively, retain sodium-dependent substrate binding in the S1 site similar to the wild-type protein. We conclude that under our experimental conditions there is only one detectable leucine molecule bound to LeuT.</p>

            <p>Malaria is transmitted when an infected <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito deposits <em>Plasmodium</em> sporozoites in the skin during a bite. Sporozoites are formed within oocysts at the mosquito midgut wall and are released into the hemolymph, from where they invade the salivary glands and are subsequently transmitted to the vertebrate host. We found that a thrombospondin-repeat containing sporozoite-specific protein named thrombospondin-releated protein 1 (TRP1) is important for oocyst egress and salivary gland invasion, and hence for the transmission of malaria. We imaged the release of sporozoites from oocysts in situ, which was preceded by active motility. Parasites lacking TRP1 failed to migrate within oocysts and did not egress, suggesting that TRP1 is a vital component of the events that precede intra-oocyst motility and subsequently sporozoite egress and salivary gland invasion.</p>

            Ten to twenty percent of postpartum women experience anxiety or depressive disorders, which can have detrimental effects on the mother, child, and family. Little is known about the neural correlates of these affective disorders when they occur in mothers, but they do have unique neural profiles during the postpartum period compared with when they occur at other times in a woman's life. Given that the neural systems affected by postpartum anxiety and depression overlap and interact with the systems involved in maternal caregiving behaviors, mother–infant interactions are highly susceptible to disruption.

            <p>Binding of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) to origins of replication marks the first step in the initiation of replication of the genome in all eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the structure of the active form of human ORC determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The complex is composed of an ORC1/4/5 motor module lobe in an organization reminiscent of the DNA polymerase clamp loader complexes. A second lobe contains the ORC2/3 subunits. The complex is organized as a double-layered shallow corkscrew, with the AAA+ and AAA+-like domains forming one layer, and the winged-helix domains (WHDs) forming a top layer. CDC6 fits easily between ORC1 and ORC2, completing the ring and the DNA-binding channel, forming an additional ATP hydrolysis site. Analysis of the ATPase activity of the complex provides a basis for understanding ORC activity as well as molecular defects observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome mutations.</p>

            <p>Previously, we reported an in-focus data acquisition method for cryo-EM single-particle analysis with the Volta phase plate (Danev and Baumeister, 2016). Here, we extend the technique to include a small amount of defocus which enables contrast transfer function measurement and correction. This hybrid approach simplifies the experiment and increases the data acquisition speed. It also removes the resolution limit inherent to the in-focus method thus allowing 3D reconstructions with resolutions better than 3 Å.</p>

            <p>The success of fMRI places constraints on the nature of the neural code. The fact that researchers can infer similarities between neural representations, despite fMRI’s limitations, implies that certain neural coding schemes are more likely than others. For fMRI to succeed given its low temporal and spatial resolution, the neural code must be smooth at the voxel and functional level such that similar stimuli engender similar internal representations. Through proof and simulation, we determine which coding schemes are plausible given both fMRI’s successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity. Deep neural network approaches, which have been forwarded as computational accounts of the ventral stream, are consistent with the success of fMRI, though functional smoothness breaks down in the later network layers. These results have implications for the nature of the neural code and ventral stream, as well as what can be successfully investigated with fMRI.</p>

            The GluD1 and GluD2 receptors form the GluD ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subfamily. Without known endogenous ligands, they have long been referred to as ‘orphan’ and remained enigmatic functionally. Recent progress has, however, radically changed this view. Both GluD receptors are expressed in wider brain regions than originally thought. Human genetic studies and analyses of knockout mice have revealed their involvement in multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The discovery of endogenous ligands, together with structural investigations, has opened the way towards a mechanistic understanding of GluD signaling at central nervous system synapses.

            <p>The fundamental metabolic decision of a cell, the balance between respiration and fermentation, rests in part on expression of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and coordination with expression of the nuclear genome (nuDNA). Previously we described mtDNA copy number depletion across many solid tumor types (Reznik et al., 2016). Here, we use orthogonal RNA-sequencing data to quantify mtDNA expression (mtRNA), and report analogously lower expression of mtRNA in tumors (relative to normal tissue) across a majority of cancer types. Several cancers exhibit a trio of mutually consistent evidence suggesting a drop in respiratory activity: depletion of mtDNA copy number, decreases in mtRNA levels, and decreases in expression of nuDNA-encoded respiratory proteins. Intriguingly, a minority of cancer types exhibit a drop in mtDNA expression but an increase in nuDNA expression of respiratory proteins, with unknown implications for respiratory activity. Our results indicate suppression of respiratory gene expression across many cancer types.</p>

            <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. Although many patients with asthma develop type-2 dominated eosinophilic inflammation, a number of individuals develop paucigranulocytic asthma, which occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia. The aetiology of paucigranulocytic asthma is unknown. However, both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and mutations in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (<em>RAGE</em>) are risk factors for asthma development. Here, we show that RAGE deficiency impairs anti-viral immunity during an early-life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV). The elevated viral load was associated with the release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) which triggered airway smooth muscle remodelling in early-life. Re-infection with PVM in later-life induced many of the cardinal features of asthma in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation. Anti-HMGB1 mitigated both early-life viral disease and asthma-like features, highlighting HMGB1 as a possible novel therapeutic target.</p>

            <p>To study the molecular basis for predator-prey coevolution, we investigated how <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> responds to the predatory fungus <em>Arthrobotrys oligospora</em>. <em>C. elegans</em> and other nematodes were attracted to volatile compounds produced by <em>A. oligospora</em>. Gas-chromatographic mass-spectral analyses of <em>A. oligospora</em>-derived volatile metabolites identified several odors mimicking food cues attractive to nematodes. One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC. We propose that <em>A. oligospora</em> likely evolved the means to use olfactory mimicry to attract its nematode prey through the olfactory neurons in <em>C. elegans</em> and related species.</p>

            <p>Injury-induced (Wallerian) axonal degeneration is regulated via the opposing actions of pro-degenerative factors such as SARM1 and a MAPK signal and pro-survival factors, the most important of which is the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 that inhibits activation of the SARM1 pathway. Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the <em>Drosophila</em> ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program.</p>

            <p>The populations of light-demanding trees that dominate the canopy of central African forests are now aging. Here, we show that the lack of regeneration of these populations began ca. 165 ya (around 1850) after major anthropogenic disturbances ceased. Since 1885, less itinerancy and disturbance in the forest has occurred because the colonial administrations concentrated people and villages along the primary communication axes. Local populations formerly gardened the forest by creating scattered openings, which were sufficiently large for the establishment of light-demanding trees. Currently, common logging operations do not create suitable openings for the regeneration of these species, whereas deforestation degrades landscapes. Using an interdisciplinary approach, which included paleoecological, archaeological, historical, and dendrological data, we highlight the long-term history of human activities across central African forests and assess the contribution of these activities to present-day forest structure and composition. The conclusions of this sobering analysis present challenges to current silvicultural practices and to those of the future.</p>

            <p>In response to environments that cause cellular stress, animals engage in sleep behavior that facilitates recovery from the stress. In <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, stress-induced sleep(SIS) is regulated by cytokine activation of the ALA neuron, which releases FLP-13 neuropeptides characterized by an amidated arginine-phenylalanine (RFamide) C-terminus motif. By performing an unbiased genetic screen for mutants that impair the somnogenic effects of FLP-13 neuropeptides, we identified the gene <em>dmsr-1</em>, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor similar to an insect RFamide receptor. DMSR-1 is activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell culture, is required for SIS <em>in vivo</em>, is expressed non-synaptically in several wake-promoting neurons, and likely couples to a Gi/o heterotrimeric G-protein. Our data expand our understanding of how a single neuroendocrine cell coordinates an organism-wide behavioral response, and suggest that similar signaling principles may function in other organisms to regulate sleep during sickness.</p>

            <p>Kinase inhibitors are effective cancer therapies, but tumors frequently develop resistance. Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. <em>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></em>mutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with <em>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></em> brain tumors.</p>

            Ghrelin is a multifaceted regulator of metabolism. Ghrelin regulates energy balance in the short term via induction of appetite and in the long term via increased body weight and adiposity. Recently, several central pathways modulating the metabolic actions of ghrelin were unmasked, and it was shown to act through different hypothalamic nuclei to induce feeding. Ghrelin also modulates glucose homeostasis, but the central mechanisms responsible for this action have not been studied in detail. Although ghrelin also acts through extrahypothalamic areas to promote feeding, this review specifically dissects hypothalamic control of ghrelin’s orexigenic and adipogenic actions and presents current understanding of the intracellular ghrelin orexigenic pathways, including their dependence on other relevant systems implicated in energy balance.

            <p>Fibronectin (FN), a major extracellular matrix component, enables integrin-mediated cell adhesion <em>via</em> binding of α5β1, αIIbβ3 and αv-class integrins to an RGD-motif. An additional linkage for α5 and αIIb is the synergy site located in close proximity to the RGD motif. We report that mice with a dysfunctional FN-synergy motif (<em>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></em>) suffer from surprisingly mild platelet adhesion and bleeding defects due to delayed thrombus formation after vessel injury. Additional loss of β3 integrins dramatically aggravates the bleedings and severely compromises smooth muscle cell coverage of the vasculature leading to embryonic lethality. Cell-based studies revealed that the synergy site is dispensable for the initial contact of α5β1 with the RGD, but essential to re-enforce the binding of α5β1/αIIbβ3 to FN. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for the FN synergy site when external forces exceed a certain threshold or when αvβ3 integrin levels decrease below a critical level.</p>

            <p>The DEAH-box helicase Prp43 is a key player in pre-mRNA splicing as well as the maturation of rRNAs. The exact <em>modus operandi</em> of Prp43 and of all other spliceosomal DEAH-box RNA helicases is still elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Prp43 complexes in different functional states and the analysis of structure-based mutants providing insights into the unwinding and loading mechanism of RNAs. The Prp43•ATP-analog•RNA complex shows the localization of the RNA inside a tunnel formed by the two RecA-like and C-terminal domains. In the ATP-bound state this tunnel can be transformed into a groove prone for RNA binding by large rearrangements of the C-terminal domains. Several conformational changes between the ATP- and ADP-bound states explain the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation, mainly mediated by a β-turn of the RecA1 domain containing the newly identified RF motif. This mechanism is clearly different to those of other RNA helicases.</p>

            <p><em>FOXC1</em> loss contributes to Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), a common human cerebellar malformation. Previously, we found that complete <em>Foxc1</em> loss leads to aberrations in proliferation, neuronal differentiation and migration in the embryonic mouse cerebellum (<a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</a>). We now demonstrate that hypomorphic <em>Foxc1</em> mutant mice have granule and Purkinje cell abnormalities causing subsequent disruptions in postnatal cerebellar foliation and lamination. Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobule which echoes the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging studies. Lineage tracing experiments in <em>Foxc1</em> mutant mouse cerebella indicate that aberrant migration of granule cell progenitors destined to form the posterior-most lobule causes this unique phenotype. Analyses of rare human del chr 6p25 fetal cerebella demonstrate extensive phenotypic overlap with our <em>Foxc1</em> mutant mouse models, validating our DWM models and demonstrating that many key mechanisms controlling cerebellar development are likely conserved between mouse and human.</p>

            Recently, Meyer and Bucci used chemogenetic technology – artificial excitatory and inhibitory receptors – to modulate neuronal activity in two connected brain regions in opposite directions simultaneously. This innovative manipulation revealed that the two regions studied, orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, are not sequentially dependent during contextual decision-making.

            <p>Bacteria often live in biofilms, which are microbial communities surrounded by a secreted extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild-type cells always increase in relative abundance in planar microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles – which are common in natural environments – wild-type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero shear that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment, providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments.</p>

            <p>Neurons face unique challenges of transporting nascent autophagic vacuoles (AVs) from distal axons toward the soma, where mature lysosomes are mainly located. Autophagy defects have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying altered autophagy remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that defective retrograde transport contributes to autophagic stress in AD axons. Amphisomes predominantly accumulate at axonal terminals of mutant hAPP mice and AD patient brains. Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers associate with AVs in AD axons and interact with dynein motors. This interaction impairs dynein recruitment to amphisomes through competitive interruption of dynein-Snapin motor-adaptor coupling, thus immobilizing them in distal axons. Consistently, deletion of <em>Snapin</em> in mice causes AD-like axonal autophagic stress, whereas overexpressing Snapin in hAPP neurons reduces autophagic accumulation at presynaptic terminals by enhancing AV retrograde transport. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insight into AD-associated autophagic stress, thus establishing a foundation for ameliorating axonal pathology in AD.</p>

            <p>Grid cells represent an ideal candidate to investigate the allocentric determinants of the brain’s cognitive map. Most studies of grid cells emphasized the roles of geometric boundaries within the navigational range of the animal. Behaviors such as novel route-taking between local environments indicate the presence of additional inputs from remote cues beyond the navigational borders. To investigate these influences, we recorded grid cells as rats explored an open-field platform in a room with salient, remote cues. The platform was rotated or translated relative to the room frame of reference. Although the local, geometric frame of reference often exerted the strongest control over the grids, the remote cues demonstrated a consistent, sometimes dominant, countervailing influence. Thus, grid cells are controlled by both local geometric boundaries and remote spatial cues, consistent with prior studies of hippocampal place cells and providing a rich representational repertoire to support complex navigational (and perhaps mnemonic) processes.</p>

            <p>Organ morphogenesis depends on the precise orchestration of cell migration, cell shape changes and cell adhesion. We demonstrate that Notch signaling is an integral part of the Wnt and Fgf signaling feedback loop coordinating cell migration and the self-organization of rosette-shaped sensory organs in the zebrafish lateral line system. We show that Notch signaling acts downstream of Fgf signaling to not only inhibit hair cell differentiation but also to induce and maintain stable epithelial rosettes. Ectopic Notch expression causes a significant increase in organ size independently of proliferation and the Hippo pathway. Transplantation and RNASeq analyses revealed that Notch signaling induces apical junctional complex genes that regulate cell adhesion and apical constriction. Our analysis also demonstrates that in the absence of patterning cues normally provided by a Wnt/Fgf signaling system, rosettes still self-organize in the presence of Notch signaling.</p>

            <p>Transient increases in mitochondrially-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate an adaptive stress response to promote longevity. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases produce ROS locally in response to various stimuli, and thereby regulate many cellular processes, but their role in aging remains unexplored. Here, we identified the <em>C. elegans</em> orthologue of mammalian mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility, MEMO-1, as a protein that inhibits BLI-3/NADPH oxidase. MEMO-1 is complexed with RHO-1/RhoA/GTPase and loss of <em>memo-1</em> results in an enhanced interaction of RHO-1 with BLI-3/NADPH oxidase, thereby stimulating ROS production that signal via p38 MAP kinase to the transcription factor SKN-1/NRF1,2,3 to promote stress resistance and longevity. Either loss of <em>memo-1</em> or increasing BLI-3/NADPH oxidase activity by overexpression is sufficient to increase lifespan. Together, these findings demonstrate that NADPH oxidase-induced redox signaling initiates a transcriptional response that protects the cell and organism, and can promote both stress resistance and longevity.</p>

            <p>Symbiotic bacteria assist in maintaining homeostasis of the animal immune system. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie symbiont-mediated host immunity are largely unknown. Tsetse flies (<em>Glossina</em> spp.) house maternally transmitted symbionts that regulate the development and function of their host’s immune system. Herein we demonstrate that the obligate mutualist, <em>Wigglesworthia</em>, up-regulates expression of <em>odorant binding protein six</em> in the gut of intrauterine tsetse larvae. This process is necessary and sufficient to induce systemic expression of the hematopoietic RUNX transcription factor <em>lozenge</em> and the subsequent production of crystal cells, which actuate the melanotic immune response in adult tsetse. Larval <em>Drosophila’s</em> indigenous microbiota, which is acquired from the environment, regulates an orthologous hematopoietic pathway in their host. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie enteric symbiont-stimulated systemic immune system development, and indicate that these processes are evolutionarily conserved despite the divergent nature of host-symbiont interactions in these model systems.</p>

            <p>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric malignacy of muscle with myogenic regulatory transcription factors MYOD and MYF5 being expressed in this disease. Consensus in the field has been that expression of these factors likely reflects the target cell of transformation rather than being required for continued tumor growth. Here, we used a transgenic zebrafish model to show that Myf5 is sufficient to confer tumor-propagating potential to RMS cells and caused tumors to initiate earlier and have higher penetrance. Analysis of human RMS revealed that MYF5 and MYOD are mutually-exclusively expressed and each is required for sustained tumor growth. ChIP-seq and mechanistic studies in human RMS uncovered that MYF5 and MYOD bind common DNA regulatory elements to alter transcription of genes that regulate muscle development and cell cycle progression. Our data support unappreciated and dominant oncogenic roles for MYF5 and MYOD convergence on common transcriptional targets to regulate human RMS growth.</p>

            <p>Sensory signals undergo substantial recoding when neural activity is relayed from sensors through pre-thalamic and thalamic nuclei to cortex. To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas.</p>

            <p>Hebb's idea of a cell assembly as the fundamental unit of neural information processing has dominated neuroscience like no other theoretical concept within the past 60 years. A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely synchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed under this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of statistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary constellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the severe computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and conceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying this methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical areas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that assembly structure and precision significantly depends on the brain area recorded and ongoing task demands.</p>

            <p>The master spindle checkpoint kinase Mps1 senses kinetochore-microtubule attachment and promotes checkpoint signaling to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. The kinetochore scaffold Knl1, when phosphorylated by Mps1, recruits checkpoint complexes Bub1–Bub3 and BubR1–Bub3 to unattached kinetochores. Active checkpoint signaling ultimately enhances the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of BubR1–Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome bound to Cdc20 (APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>) to delay anaphase onset. Using in vitro reconstitution, we show that Mps1 promotes APC/C inhibition by MCC components through phosphorylating Bub1 and Mad1. Phosphorylated Bub1 binds to Mad1–Mad2. Phosphorylated Mad1 directly interacts with Cdc20. Mutations of Mps1 phosphorylation sites in Bub1 or Mad1 abrogate the spindle checkpoint in human cells. Therefore, Mps1 promotes checkpoint activation through sequentially phosphorylating Knl1, Bub1, and Mad1. This sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade makes the checkpoint highly responsive to Mps1 and to kinetochore-microtubule attachment.</p>

            <p>Pregnancy complications are poorly represented in the archeological record, despite their importance in contemporary and ancient societies. While excavating a Byzantine cemetery in Troy, we discovered calcified abscesses among a woman’s remains. Scanning electron microscopy of the tissue revealed ‘ghost cells’, resulting from dystrophic calcification, which preserved ancient maternal, fetal and bacterial DNA of a severe infection, likely chorioamnionitis. <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em> dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that <em>G. vaginalis</em> Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas <em>S. saprophyticus</em> Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of <em>S. saprophyticus</em> infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals. These results highlight the complex and dynamic interactions with our microbial milieu that underlie severe maternal infections.</p>

            <p>While 20–30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) may arise from precursors with serrated glands, only 8–10% of CRCs manifest serrated morphology at diagnosis. Markers for distinguishing CRCs arising from ‘serrated’ versus ‘conventional adenoma’ precursors are lacking. We studied 36 human serrated CRCs and found CDX2 loss or <em>BRAF</em> mutations in ~60% of cases and often together (p<em>=</em>0.04). CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in adult mouse intestinal epithelium led to serrated morphology tumors (including carcinomas) and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> potently interacted with CDX2 silencing to alter gene expression. Like human serrated lesions, CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium expressed gastric markers. Organoids from CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>–mutant colon epithelium showed serrated features, and partially recapitulated the gene expression pattern in mouse colon tissues. We present a novel mouse tumor model based on signature defects seen in many human serrated CRCs – CDX2 loss and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. The mouse intestinal tumors show significant phenotypic similarities to human serrated CRCs and inform about serrated CRC pathogenesis.</p>

            <p>Many pancreatic transcription factors that are essential for islet cell differentiation have been well characterized; however, because they are often expressed in several different cell populations, their functional hierarchy remains unclear. To parse out the spatiotemporal regulation of islet cell differentiation, we used a <em>Neurog3-Cre</em> allele to ablate <em>Nkx2.2</em>, one of the earliest and most broadly expressed islet transcription factors, specifically in the Neurog3<sup>+</sup> endocrine progenitor lineage (<em>Nkx2.2<sup>△endo</sup></em>). Remarkably, many essential components of the β cell transcriptional network that were down-regulated in the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>KO</sup></em> mice, were maintained in the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>△endo</sup></em> mice - yet the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>△endo</sup></em> mice displayed defective β cell differentiation and recapitulated the <em>Nkx2.2<sup>KO</sup></em> phenotype. This suggests that Nkx2.2 is not only required in the early pancreatic progenitors, but has additional essential activities within the endocrine progenitor population. Consistently, we demonstrate Nkx2.2 functions as an integral component of a modular regulatory program to correctly specify pancreatic islet cell fates.</p>

            <p>Expanded GGGGCC repeats in the first intron of the <em>C9orf72</em> gene represent the most common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the mechanisms underlying repeat-induced disease remain incompletely resolved. One proposed gain-of-function mechanism is that repeat-containing RNA forms aggregates that sequester RNA binding proteins, leading to altered RNA metabolism in motor neurons. Here, we identify the zinc finger protein Zfp106 as a specific GGGGCC RNA repeat-binding protein, and using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that Zfp106 interacts with multiple other RNA binding proteins, including the ALS-associated factors TDP-43 and FUS. We also show that <em>Zfp106</em> knockout mice develop severe motor neuron degeneration, which can be suppressed by transgenic restoration of Zfp106 specifically in motor neurons. Finally, we show that Zfp106 potently suppresses neurotoxicity in a <em>Drosophila</em> model of <em>C9orf72</em> ALS. Thus, these studies identify Zfp106 as an RNA binding protein with important implications for ALS.</p>

            <p>RbpA and CarD are essential transcription regulators in mycobacteria. Mechanistic analyses of promoter open complex (RPo) formation establish that RbpA and CarD cooperatively stimulate formation of an intermediate (RP2) leading to RPo; formation of RP2 is likely a bottleneck step at the majority of mycobacterial promoters. Once RPo forms, CarD also disfavors its isomerization back to RP2. We determined a 2.76 Å-resolution crystal structure of a mycobacterial transcription initiation complex (TIC) with RbpA as well as a CarD/RbpA/TIC model. Both CarD and RbpA bind near the upstream edge of the −10 element where they likely facilitate DNA bending and impede transcription bubble collapse. In vivo studies demonstrate the essential role of RbpA, show the effects of RbpA truncations on transcription and cell physiology, and indicate additional functions for RbpA not evident in vitro. This work provides a framework to understand the control of mycobacterial transcription by RbpA and CarD.</p>

            <p>Membrane proteins frequently assemble into higher order homo- or hetero-oligomers within their natural lipid environment. This complex formation can modulate their folding, activity as well as substrate selectivity. Non-disruptive methods avoiding critical steps, such as membrane disintegration, transfer into artificial environments or chemical modifications are therefore essential to analyze molecular mechanisms of native membrane protein assemblies. The combination of cell-free synthetic biology, nanodisc-technology and non-covalent mass spectrometry provides excellent synergies for the analysis of membrane protein oligomerization within defined membranes. We exemplify our strategy by oligomeric state characterization of various membrane proteins including ion channels, transporters and membrane-integrated enzymes assembling up to hexameric complexes. We further indicate a lipid-dependent dimer formation of MraY translocase correlating with the enzymatic activity. The detergent-free synthesis of membrane protein/nanodisc samples and the analysis by LILBID mass spectrometry provide a versatile platform for the analysis of membrane proteins in a native environment.</p>

            <p>Animals host multi-species microbial communities (microbiomes) whose properties may result from inter-species interactions; however, current understanding of host-microbiome interactions derives mostly from studies in which elucidation of microbe-microbe interactions is difficult. In exploring how <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences <em>Drosophila</em> olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. <em>Drosophila</em> prefers a <em>Saccharomyces</em>-<em>Acetobacter</em> co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, <em>Or42b. Acetobacter</em> metabolism of <em>Saccharomyces-</em>derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline. Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal a beneficial multispecies microbiome.</p>

            <p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is believed to confer protection against <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria, but the precise nature of the protective effect has proved difficult to define as G6PD deficiency has multiple allelic variants with different effects in males and females, and it has heterogeneous effects on the clinical outcome of <em>P. falciparum</em> infection. Here we report an analysis of multiple allelic forms of G6PD deficiency in a large multi-centre case-control study of severe malaria, using the WHO classification of G6PD mutations to estimate each individual’s level of enzyme activity from their genotype. Aggregated across all genotypes, we find that increasing levels of G6PD deficiency are associated with decreasing risk of cerebral malaria, but with increased risk of severe malarial anaemia. Models of balancing selection based on these findings indicate that an evolutionary trade-off between different clinical outcomes of <em>P. falciparum</em> infection could have been a major cause of the high levels of G6PD polymorphism seen in human populations.</p>

            Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) was recently revealed to be a synaptic player during plasticity events in addition to its well-established role as a general controlling factor in cell proliferation and neuronal growth during development. Alterations of these direct actions of PTEN at synapses may lead to synaptic dysfunction with behavioral and cognitive consequences. A recent paradigmatic example of this situation, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with excessive recruitment of PTEN into synapses leading to pathological synaptic depression.
