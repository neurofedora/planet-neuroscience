              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19826">Neurotremor: A wearable Supportive Device for Supporting Upper Limb Muscle Function</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sensor-fused wearable assistance prototype for upper-limb function (triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis) is presented. The device integrates surface electromyography (sEMG), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and flex/force sensors on an M5StickC plus an ESP32-S3 compute hub. Signals are band-pass and notch filtered; features (RMS, MAV, zero-crossings, and 4-12 Hz tremor-band power) are computed in 250 ms windows and fed to an INT8 TensorFlow Lite Micro model. Control commands are bounded by a control-barrier-function safety envelope and delivered within game-based tasks with lightweight personalization. In a pilot technical feasibility evaluation with healthy volunteers (n = 12) performing three ADL-oriented tasks, tremor prominence decreased (Delta TI = -0.092, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.079]), range of motion increased (+12.65%, 95% CI [+8.43, +13.89]), repetitions rose (+2.99 min^-1, 95% CI [+2.61, +3.35]), and the EMG median-frequency slope became less negative (Delta = +0.100 Hz/min, 95% CI [+0.083, +0.127]). The sensing-to-assist loop ran at 100 Hz with 8.7 ms median on-device latency, 100% session completion, and 0 device-related adverse events. These results demonstrate technical feasibility of embedded, sensor-fused assistance for upper-limb function; formal patient studies under IRB oversight are planned.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19764">A flexible framework for structural plasticity in GPU-accelerated sparse spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20323">Convexity of Neural Codes with Four Maximal Codewords</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.20323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Place cells are neurons that act as biological position sensors, associated with and firing in response to regions of an environment to situate an organism in space. These associations are recorded in (combinatorial) neural codes, motivating the following mathematical question: Which neural codes are generated by a collection of convex open sets in Euclidean space? Giusti and Itskov showed that a necessary condition for convexity is the absence of ``local obstructions." This necessary condition is, in fact, sufficient for certain families of codes. One such family consists of all codes with up to three maximal codewords. In this article, we investigate codes with four maximal codewords, showing that for many such codes, convexity is characterized by the absence of local obstructions, whereas for other such codes, convexity is characterized by the absence of local obstructions and a second type of obstruction, a ``wheel". Key to our analysis is a case-by-case investigation based on the nerve complex of the set of maximal codewords of a neural code. Up to symmetry, there are 20 possible nerves; and our results fully characterize convexity in 15 of the 20 cases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20709">Separating the what and how of compositional computation to enable reuse and continual learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible (re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network (RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional. We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial. We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional generalization to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Neurological disorders pose major global health challenges, driving advances in brain signal analysis. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are widely used for diagnosis and monitoring. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations hinder the development of robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. For each condition, we review representative methods and their quantitative results, integrating performance comparisons with analyses of data usage, model design, and task-specific adaptations, while highlighting the role of pre-trained multi-task models in achieving scalable, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a standardized benchmark to evaluate models across diverse datasets and improve reproducibility, emphasizing how recent innovations are transforming neurological diagnostics toward intelligent, adaptable healthcare systems.

                arXiv:2509.02139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii) Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image transformations.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for quantifying mental and emotional states over time by combining virtual reality (VR) exposure with EEG recordings. Participants experienced a stress-inducing work scenario in VR, originally designed as a training tool for bank employees, providing a controlled proxy for high-stakes situations. This setup enables integration of subjective emotional self-assessments with objective neural data, from which an algorithm was efficiently used to infer emotional states. Building on these measurements, we propose possible mathematical models to capture the temporal dynamics of mental states, offering a quantitative approach to studying emotional processing and informing adaptive training in complex environments.

                arXiv:2510.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cerebral cortex spontaneously displays different patterns of activity that evolve over time according to the brain state. Sleep, wakefulness, resting states, and attention are examples of a wide spectrum of physiological states that can be sustained by the same structural network. Furthermore, additional states are generated by drugs (e.g., different levels of anesthesia) or by pathological conditions (e.g., brain lesions, disorders of consciousness). While the significance of understanding brain states in relation to brain dynamics and behavior has become increasingly evident over the past two decades, a unified definition of brain states remains elusive. In this review, we focus on two extremes of this spectrum: synchronous versus asynchronous states. These functional states predominantly underlie unconsciousness and consciousness, respectively, although exceptions exist. Our aim is to integrate data from different levels into a multiscale understanding, ranging from local circuits to whole-brain dynamics, including properties such as cortical complexity, functional connectivity, synchronization, wave propagation, and excitatory-inhibitory balance that vary across states and characterize them. Experimental and clinical data, as well as computational models (at micro-, meso-, and macrocortical levels) associated with the discussed brain states, are made available to readers.

Abstract: Although quantum systems are generally described by quantum state vectors, we show that in certain cases their measurement processes can be reformulated as probabilistic equations expressed in terms of probabilistic state vectors. These probabilistic representations can, in turn, be approximated by the neural network dynamics of the Tensor Brain (TB) model.
  The Tensor Brain is a recently proposed framework for modeling perception and memory in the brain, providing a biologically inspired mechanism for efficiently integrating generated symbolic representations into reasoning processes.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

                arXiv:2510.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving and optimizing differential equations (DEs) is ubiquitous in both engineering and fundamental science. The promise of quantum architectures to accelerate scientific computing thus naturally involved interest towards how efficiently quantum algorithms can solve DEs. Differentiable quantum circuits (DQC) offer a viable route to compute DE solutions using a variational approach amenable to existing quantum computers, by producing a machine-learnable surrogate of the solution. Quantum extremal learning (QEL) complements such approach by finding extreme points in the output of learnable models of unknown (implicit) functions, offering a powerful tool to bypass a full DE solution, in cases where the crux consists in retrieving solution extrema. In this work, we provide the results from the first experimental demonstration of both DQC and QEL, displaying their performance on a synthetic usecase. Whilst both DQC and QEL are expected to require digital quantum hardware, we successfully challenge this assumption by running a closed-loop instance on a commercial analog quantum computer, based upon neutral atom technology.

                arXiv:2505.24161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making on neuromorphic hardware, making them attractive for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. However, most RL algorithms for continuous control are designed for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly the target network soft update mechanism, which conflicts with the discrete and non-differentiable dynamics of spiking neurons. We show that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training and degrades performance. To bridge the gap between discrete SNNs and continuous-control algorithms, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The proxy network introduces continuous and differentiable dynamics that enable smooth target updates, stabilizing the learning process. Since the proxy operates only during training, the deployed SNN remains fully energy-efficient with no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently improves stability and achieves up to $32\%$ higher performance across various spiking neuron models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables SNNs with simple Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons to surpass their ANN counterparts in continuous control. This work highlights the importance of SNN-tailored RL algorithms and paves the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

                arXiv:2211.00198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their high temporal resolution and large dynamic range, event cameras are uniquely suited for the analysis of time-periodic signals in an image. In this work we present an efficient and fully asynchronous event camera algorithm for detecting the fundamental frequency at which image pixels flicker. The algorithm employs a second-order digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter to perform an approximate per-pixel brightness reconstruction and is more robust to high-frequency noise than the baseline method we compare to. We further demonstrate that using the falling edge of the signal leads to more accurate period estimates than the rising edge, and that for certain signals interpolating the zero-level crossings can further increase accuracy. Our experiments find that the outstanding capabilities of the camera in detecting frequencies up to 64kHz for a single pixel do not carry over to full sensor imaging as readout bandwidth limitations become a serious obstacle. This suggests that a hardware implementation closer to the sensor will allow for greatly improved frequency imaging. We discuss the important design parameters for fullsensor frequency imaging and present Frequency Cam, an open-source implementation as a ROS node that can run on a single core of a laptop CPU at more than 50 million events per second. It produces results that are qualitatively very similar to those obtained from the closed source vibration analysis module in Prophesee's Metavision Toolkit. The code for Frequency Cam and a demonstration video can be found at https://github.com/ros-event-camera/frequency_cam

                arXiv:2502.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.

                arXiv:2505.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Designing effective black-box optimizers is hampered by limited problem-specific knowledge and manual control that spans months for almost every detail. In this paper, we present \textit{DesignX}, the first automated algorithm design framework that generates an effective optimizer specific to a given black-box optimization problem within seconds. Rooted in the first principles, we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2) hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which, conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community. We provide DesignX's Python project at~ https://github.com/MetaEvo/DesignX.

                Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is recognized as one of the key strategies to support culturally responsive and inclusive education. In the sections that follow, we draw upon current international literature and studies to identify approaches with respect to embedding Indigenous knowledge into TVET curricula - strategies and challenges; outcomes. Eighty-five peer-reviewed articles between 2020 and 2025 were reviewed according to PRISMA 2020, concentrating on pedagogical models and methods, curriculum construction process, community involvement and student performance. The outcomes reveal that effective integration is grounded on culturally relevant teaching resources and active engagement with indigenous communities, along with traditional knowledge systems coupling to technical skills. Some of the challenges involve institutionalized barriers, a lack of teacher training and resources can restrict the ways in which we see Indigenous perspectives incorporated in meaningful ways. Notwithstanding these obstacles, there is evidence that students who experience Indigenous knowledge in TVET display higher levels of cultural awareness and identity formation, and engagement with learning; their communities are more empowered to participate in education. The review emphasizes the necessity for an overall framework and policies supporting sustainable integration, and advises that long-term effects on employability, social inclusion and community development be investigated in future studies. By highlighting the importance of Indigenous knowledge in TVET, this study adds to discussions on culturally-responsive pedagogical practice and offers practical advice for educators, policy makers and researchers aiming to improve TVET practices across the world.

                In the contemporary digital landscape, social media platforms have radically reshaped consumer-brand interactions, with Instagram emerging as a pivotal channel for luxury brand marketing. This study investigates the adoption of luxury products through Instagram by integrating psychological, social, and demographic predictors with advanced analytical methodologies. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 205 respondents, we examine how Instagram engagement metrics—such as time spent on the platform, influencer marketing, sponsored advertisements, and interactive content—impact consumer adoption behaviours. Employing multiple statistical techniques including multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and path analysis, alongside machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and decision trees, we identify the primary drivers of purchase intention and brand trustworthiness in the luxury context. Notably, while surface-level engagement metrics show limited predictive power, factors such as brand trust, prestige, uniqueness, and personalized recommendations have strong influences on consumer purchase intention. The SVM model accurately predicts adoption likelihood with 87% accuracy, underscoring the efficacy of psychological and social variables as discriminators. Additionally, sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback reveals predominantly positive consumer attitudes toward Instagram marketing strategies. Our findings highlight the nuanced role of brand-related psychological constructs and demographic variables in shaping luxury product adoption, offering actionable insights for marketers aiming to optimize Instagram’s potential in luxury branding. This integrative approach advances both theoretical understanding and practical applications, reinforcing the importance of authenticity, emotional connection, and targeted psychographic segmentation in luxury digital marketing.

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. A total of 82 participants (41 cases and 41 controls) will be recruited. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024, during the Indonesia’s dry season. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                <p>Epileptic seizures involve the brain transitioning from a resting state to an abnormal state of synchronized bursting, akin to a bifurcation in dynamical systems where a parameter shift triggers a qualitative change in behavior. A comprehensive model was previously developed that used dynamical equations capable of simulating 16 "dynamotypes" of seizures that span the full range of theoretical first-order dynamics. The current work is a tool to understand and implement this model with the goal of generating a wide range of synthetic seizures. We present a dynamical atlas of all 16 possible onset&ndash;offset bifurcation combinations, each characterized by distinct features in simulated EEG-like recordings. We include a tutorial and graphical user interphase that generates diverse simulated seizures. In addition, we include methods to add realistic noise and filtering effects to enhance their resemblance to human EEG data. This toolbox has two purposes: it is a practical, educational demonstration of the dynamical principles underlying seizure bifurcations, and it provides the algorithms necessary to produce large numbers of realistic, diverse seizure patterns that have similar noise and filtering characteristics as human EEG. This generative model can aid in training seizure detection algorithms, understanding brain dynamical behavior for clinicians, and exploring the impact of noise on EEG recordings and detection algorithms.</p>

                <p>Most statistical inferences in neuroscience and psychology are based on frequentist statistics, which rely on sampling distributions: the long-run outcomes of multiple experiments, given a certain model. Yet, sampling distributions are poorly understood and rarely explicitly considered when making inferences. In this tutorial and commentary, I demonstrate how to use simulations to illustrate sampling distributions to answer simple practical questions: for instance, if we could run thousands of experiments, what would the outcome look like? What do these simulations tell us about the results from a single experiment? Such simulations can be run a priori, given expected results, or a posteriori, using existing datasets. Both approaches can help make explicit the data generating process and the sources of variability; they also reveal the large uncertainty in our experimental estimation and lead to the sobering realization that, in most situations, we should not make a big deal out of results from a single experiment. Simulations can also help demonstrate how the selection of effect sizes conditional on some arbitrary cutoff (<I>p</I> &le; 0.05) leads to a literature filled with false positives, a powerful illustration of the damage done in part by researchers&rsquo; over-confidence in their statistical tools. The tutorial focuses on graphical descriptions and covers examples using correlation analyses, proportion data, and response latency data.

                <p>by Ernesto Tavares-Neto, Marcel Aguilella-Arzo, Vicente M. Aguilella</p>

Electrostatic interactions are crucial for protein structure and function, especially in mesoscopic protein channels where ion selectivity is largely governed by the protein’s electrostatic properties. Understanding the protonation state of ionizable residues across pH values —often described by their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>— is key to linking structure and function. However, experimental p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> determination is challenging, typically carried out using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance only in a limited number of membrane proteins. Thus, computational methods are the primary alternative. Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) simulation is one of the most accurate p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods in proteins that contain many charged residues since it captures the coupling between conformational dynamics and residue protonation. Here we study the charge state of a general diffusion porin, OmpF, in which protons exert a crucial regulation of the channel discrimination of small inorganic ions as well as antibiotic translocation. We compare different p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods, using CpHMD as a benchmark, and discuss the somewhat unusual titration of several acidic residues. The most widely used p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods, though effective for globular proteins, fall short for membrane-embedded channels either because they were trained using pKa measurements in globular proteins or because of a poor description of the lipidic environment.

                <p>by Jiawen Chang, Zhuda Yang, Changsong Zhou</p>

The spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are jointly shaped by directed structural interactions and heterogeneous intrinsic features of the neural components. Despite well-developed methods for estimating directionality in network connections from network of homogeneous nodes, how local heterogeneity impacts on directionality estimation remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in shaping network directionality and how these interactions should be incorporated into reconstruction frameworks remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel reconstruction framework that simultaneously estimates effective heterogeneity across network nodes and asymmetric network connections from neural activity and symmetric connection, both are assessible in experimental data, validated using macaque cortical connectivity data and several circuit models. We found that the estimated local heterogeneity remains consistent across various forms of parameterized local circuit heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated and quantified how hidden local inhibitory populations only modify within-region connection strengths, elucidating the functional equivalence between dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory networks and purely observing excitatory networks when estimating effective heterogeneity and asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrated the sampling interval effect in estimating network interactions with respect to the sampling resolution. Together, our results not only provide a unified framework for evaluating relative functional contributions of local heterogeneity and asymmetry to overall system dynamics but also reveal the fundamental limitations and scaling principles in reconstructing neural circuit connectivity from experimental observations.

                <p>by Krutika Patidar, Ashlee N. Ford Versypt</p>

The progression of diabetic kidney disease is often characterized by early dysfunction of glomerular endothelial cells, including alterations in fenestration size and number linked to impaired glomerular filtration. However, the cellular mechanisms regulating fenestrations in glomerular endothelial cells remain poorly understood due to limitations in existing <i>in vitro</i> models, challenges in imaging small fenestrations <i>in vivo</i>, and inconsistencies between <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> findings. This study used a logic-based protein-protein interaction network model with normalized Hill functions for dynamics to explore how glucose-mediated signaling dysregulation impacts fenestration dynamics in glomerular endothelial cells. Key drivers of fenestration loss and size changes were identified by incorporating signaling pathways related to actin remodeling, myosin light chain kinase, Rho-associated kinase, calcium, and VEGF and its receptors. The model predicted how hyperglycemia in diabetic mice leads to significant fenestration loss and increased size of fenestrations. Glycemic control in the pre-diabetic stage mitigated signaling dysregulation but was less effective as diabetic kidney disease developed and progressed. The model suggested alternative disease intervention strategies to maintain the integrity of the fenestration structure, such as targeting Rho-associated kinase, VEGF-A, NFκB, and actin stress fibers.

                <p>by Yiyuan Teresa Huang, Zenas C. Chao</p>

Our brain uses prior experience to anticipate the timing of upcoming events. This dynamic process can be modeled using a hazard function derived from the probability distribution of event timings. However, the contexts of an event can lead to various probability distributions for the same event, and it remains unclear how the brain integrates these distributions into a coherent temporal prediction. In this study, we create a foreperiod sequence paradigm consisting of a sequence of paired trials, where in each trial, participants respond to a target signal after a specified time interval (i.e., foreperiod) following a warning cue. The prediction of the target onset in the second trial can be based on two probability distributions: the unconditional probability of the second foreperiod and its conditional probability given the foreperiod in the first trial. These probability distributions are then transformed into hazard functions to represent the unconditional and conditional temporal predictions. The behavioral model incorporating both predictions and their mutual modulation provides the best fit for reaction times to the target signal, indicating that both temporal statistics are integrated to make predictions. We further show that electroencephalographic source signals are also best reconstructed when integrating both predictions. Specifically, the unconditional and conditional predictions are encoded separately in the posterior and anterior brain regions, and integration of these two types of predictive processing requires a third region, particularly the right posterior cingulate area. Our study reveals brain networks that integrate multilevel temporal information, offering insight into the hierarchical predictive coding of time.

Neurons can adjust synaptic output according to the postsynaptic partners. However, the target-specific regulation of synaptic structures within individual neurons in the central nervous system remains unresolved. Applying the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated split-GFP tagging, we visualized the endogenous active zone scaffold protein, Bruchpilot (Brp), in specific cells. This technology enabled the spatial characterization of the presynaptic scaffolds only within the Kenyon cells (KCs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom bodies. We found the patterned accumulation of Brp among the compartments of axon terminals, where a KC synapses onto different postsynaptic neurons. Mechanistically, the localized octopaminergic projections along γ KC terminals regulate this compartmental Brp heterogeneity via Octβ2R and cAMP signaling. We further found that physiological stress, such as food or sleep deprivation reorganizes this intracellular pattern in an octopamine-dependent manner. Such concurrent regulation of local active zone assemblies thus suggests how the mushroom bodies integrate changing physiological states.

                <p>by Kazuo L. Nakamura, Karen Zhang, Mario R. Mestre, Matías Rojas-Montero, Seth L. Shipman</p>

Retrons are bacterial immune systems that protect a bacterial population against phages by killing infected hosts. Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase (RT), a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase (RT), noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we identify seven new retron systems, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize DNA production by these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of <i>Escherichia coli</i> phages. We find that two of these retrons are disrupted by other elements, in one case a group II intron and in another a separate defense system, yet both retrons still produce RT-DNA. For two other retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we engineer these retrons for genome editing in <i>E. coli</i>, demonstrating their potential use in a biotechnological application.

                Background Performance monitoring is essential for enhancing academic staff productivity and institutional accountability in higher education. In Uganda, private chartered universities face challenges in implementing effective performance monitoring systems. This study examines the types and effectiveness of these systems in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 386 academic staff using structured questionnaires, while qualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 10 academic deans from four selected universities. Ethical approval was obtained from institutional review boards and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS3145ES). Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to analyze quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative responses. Results Findings indicate that various performance monitoring tools are in use, including student evaluations, peer reviews, and supervisory assessments. However, their application is often inconsistent, with limited feedback loops and weak integration into staff development initiatives. Quantitative analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between effective performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that performance monitoring accounted for 21.3% of the variance in staff performance. Conclusions While performance monitoring tools are present in private chartered universities in Western Uganda, their inconsistent implementation undermines their effectiveness. Strengthening the integration of monitoring outcomes into professional development and decision-making processes could enhance academic staff performance. These findings underscore the need for systematic policy enforcement and capacity-building in performance management practices within the sector.

                Wang et al. reveal a neuroanatomical and functional crosstalk between cholinergic enteric neurons and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia that mediates colonic interoception. While this pathway typically elicits non-aversive reflexes under physiological conditions, inflammatory colitis triggers plasticity that transforms its output to promote aversive behaviors.

                Xu et al. report that intratumoral Citrobacter enrichment correlates with poor overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients. An intratumoral Citrobacter freundii strain metabolizes 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) into inactive products via PreTA. Gimeracil, an inhibitor of human dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, preserves 5-FU efficacy by blocking PreTA activity.

                Ras mutations drive tumorigenesis yet persist in normal tissues. Elliot et al. explore this paradox, finding that HRASG12V induces bifurcating cell fates in the zebrafish larval epidermis, with lamc2+krt18+ cancer stem cell-like cells emerging from permissive cells at the preneoplastic stage and expressing neutrophil-modulating cytokines that instigate reciprocal tumor-supportive crosstalk.

                Waschina et al. explored how multi-strain probiotic supplementation influenced the gut microbiome and metabolome in very-low-birth-weight infants at high risk of late-onset sepsis. Probiotics promote colonization with beneficial microbes and reduce antibiotic-resistant pathobionts. Late-onset sepsis is associated with lower levels of key fermentation products (lactate and acetate) of probiotics.

                Gao et al. reveal that the metabolic interactions of gut microbial community are driven by the key competitive and cooperative microbiota, which are potentially associated with non-human primate health. The study improves our understanding of the complex interactions in microbial community, providing potential avenues to therapeutic implications.

                Rodriguez et al. employ bioinformatic analyses to discover effectors involved in the virulence of the understudied human fungal pathogen Histoplasma and uncover an expansion of knottins (inhibitor cystine knot proteins). Their algorithms are broadly applicable to other organisms and uncover virulence effectors with diverse predicted structures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104043">Toward stable replication of genomic information in pools of RNA molecules</a></h4>

              
                The transition from prebiotic chemistry to living systems requires the emergence of a scheme for enzyme-free genetic replication. Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, monomers and short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a feedstock molecule to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the formation of erroneous products can be suppressed if each ligation involves at least one monomer, while ligations between two long oligomers are effectively prevented. This kinetic discrimination (favoring monomer incorporation over oligomer–oligomer ligation) may be an intrinsic property of the activation chemistry, or can be externally imposed by selectively activating only monomers in the pool. Surprisingly, under these conditions, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon that has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers. Taken together, the VCG constitutes a promising scenario of prebiotic information replication: It could mitigate challenges in non-enzymatic copying via template-directed polymerization, such as short lengths of copied products and high error rates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105319">Molecular dynamics of the matrisome across sea anemone life history</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary expansion of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules has been crucial for the establishment of cell adhesion and the transition from unicellular to multicellular life. Members of the early diverging metazoan phylum Cnidaria offer an exceptionally rich perspective into the metazoan core adhesome and its original function in developmental and morphogenetic processes. Here, we present the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors for the starlet sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> based on in silico prediction and quantitative proteomic analysis of decellularized mesoglea from different life stages. The integration of the matrisome with single-cell transcriptome atlases shows that gastrodermal cells are the primary producers of <i>Nematostella’s</i> complex ECM, confirming the homology of the cnidarian inner cell layer with bilaterian mesoderm. The transition from larva to polyp is marked by an upregulation of metalloproteases and basement membrane components including all members of an unusually diversified SVEP1/Polydom family, suggesting massive epithelial remodeling. The enrichment of Wnt/PCP pathway factors during this process further indicates directed cell rearrangements as a key contributor to the polyp’s morphogenesis. Mesoglea maturation in adult polyps involves wound response proteins indicating shared molecular patterns in growth and regeneration. Our study identifies conserved matrisomal networks that coordinate transitions in <i>Nematostella’s</i> life history.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98920">Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness outside of perturbation paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Signatures of consciousness are found in spectral and temporal properties of neuronal activity. Among these, spatiotemporal complexity after a perturbation has recently emerged as a robust metric to infer levels of consciousness. Perturbation paradigms remain, however, difficult to perform routinely. To discover alternative paradigms and metrics, we systematically explore brain stimulation and resting-state activity in a whole-brain model. We find that perturbational complexity only occurs when the brain model operates within a specific dynamical regime, in which spontaneous activity produces a large degree of functional network reorganizations referred to as being fluid. The regime of high brain fluidity is characterized by a small battery of metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and predicts the impact of consciousness-altering drugs (Xenon, Propofol, and Ketamine). We validate the predictions in a cohort of 15 subjects at various stages of consciousness and demonstrate their agreement with previously reported perturbational complexity, but in a more accessible paradigm. Beyond the facilitation in clinical use, the metrics highlight complexity properties of brain dynamics in support of the emergence of consciousness.

">Persistent Adaptation through Dual-Timescale Regulation of Ion Channel Properties</a></h4>

              
                Neurons are terminally differentiated cells that adapt to maintain stable function over years, despite encountering a wide range of environmental perturbations. Some adaptations are transient, fading once the perturbation ends. Others are persistent, continuing to influence a neuron's responses to future challenges even after baseline conditions are restored. These persistent adaptations are especially intriguing because some remain undetectable under normal conditions -- only becoming apparent upon re-exposure to a perturbation. Among the many mechanisms that may contribute to persistent adaptation, we investigate one based on the regulation of intrinsic currents. Using a computational model of activity-dependent homeostasis, we show that slow changes in channel density can encode the influence of past experience and shape future responses while rapid shifts in ion channel voltage-dependence provide immediate compensation during perturbations. Together, these dual processes tune a neuron's intrinsic excitability, enabling persistent adaptation.

">Neurally-Informed Models of Protracted Sequential Sampling of Long, Noise-free Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Sequential sampling models have provided a rich theoretical framework in the study of perceptual decision-making and quantitatively capture diverse behavioural data. However, research has increasingly highlighted that for the long-duration, statistically stationary stimuli commonly studied, it is difficult to definitively establish the operation of protracted sampling or temporal integration as opposed to non-integration strategies like extremum-detection, especially when based on behaviour alone. Here, we attempted to resolve such mechanistic details in the interesting case of judging subtle feature-differences (contrast) in a long (1.6-sec), noiseless stimulus, by jointly analysing the accuracy of delayed reports and the dynamics of a centroparietal electroencephalographic signal (CPP) reflecting decision formation. Accuracy steadily increased across four covertly-manipulated evidence durations and the CPP remained elevated throughout the stimulus period, together indicating protracted sampling. Models fit to CPP dynamics as well as accuracy resolved more details than those fit to accuracy alone, such as the setting of a bound. However, a convincing joint neural-behaviour fit could be achieved not only by a temporal integration model, but also by an extremum detection model that evoked a stereotyped signal flagging the first single-sample bound crossing. This illuminates interesting, testable alternatives to integration, and the limited extent to which combining neural decision dynamics with behavioural information can uniquely identify underlying mechanisms in some behavioural scenarios.

">Proteomic characterization of neuronal extracellular vesicle interactomes in Alzheimer's disease mouse model through TurboID-based proximity labeling</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are critical mediators of neuronal communication and have been implicated in propagating pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular interactome of neuronal EVs in vivo remains poorly defined. Here, we employed TurboID-CD9-based proximity biotinylation to label and capture EV-interacting proteins in the hippocampus of wild-type (WT) and APPNLGF knock-in AD mouse models. Adeno-associated viral delivery of hSyn1 promoter-driven TurboID-CD9 enabled neuron-specific EV tagging, followed by in vivo biotinylation and affinity purification of labeled proteins. Proteomic analysis using data independent acquisition liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry identified 5,502 proteins, with enriched pathways involving synaptic transmission, vesicle trafficking, and inhibitory neurotransmission. Comparative analyses revealed robust enrichment of GABAergic signaling components, including GABAA receptor subunits (Gabrb3, Gabra1, Gabbr2), Ncam1, and chloride transporters, in both WT and APPNLGF EV interactomes, with additional disease-associated proteins (Mapt, Snca) and potassium channel enrichment observed in APPNLGF mice. Proximity ligation assays validated direct EV-associated biotinylation of Ncam1, Gabrb3, and Gad1, with Gad1 showing significant upregulation in the APPNLGF cohort. In silico HADDOCK docking supported stable interactions between CD9 and these target proteins, revealing plausible EV-protein interfaces. These findings define the in vivo neuronal EV interactome and its remodeling in amyloid pathology, implicating EV-associated GABAergic and ion channel proteins in network excitability regulation. This work establishes a proteomic and structural framework for understanding EV-mediated signaling in health and disease, providing candidate targets for therapeutic modulation of excitatory / inhibitory balance in AD.

">Exacerbation of a Subset of Behavioral Phenotypes by Early Treatment with AAV FOXG1 Gene Replacement Therapy in a Mouse Model of FOXG1 Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                FOXG1 syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, profound intellectual disability with communication deficits including lack of speech, impaired social interaction, increased anxiety, hyperkinetic/dyskinetic movements, seizures and abnormal sleep patterns. Mutations in a single allele of the FOXG1 gene cause disease, likely due to loss-of-function. However, current therapies do not target this root cause of FOXG1 syndrome and have little to modest therapeutic benefit on only a small subset of symptoms. Recently, we reported the beneficial effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV) human FOXG1 gene replacement therapy administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection at postnatal day 6 (P6) on several behavioral deficits that are relevant to key features of human FOXG1 syndrome, in male FOXG1 mice that were engineered with a highly prevalent, patient-specific Q84P mutation. Here, we report the behavioral effects of AAV human FOXG1 gene replacement therapy administered by ICV injection in female as well as male mice and at an earlier age - postnatal day 2 (P2). Although the earlier studies had suggested that AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of a subset of functional deficits in human FOXG1 syndrome with no toxicity observations, our current study shows that certain motor behaviors can be negatively impacted or exacerbated by P2 treatment with AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy, in female but not male FOXG1 mice. Given these results, the risk-benefit balance of AAV FOXG1 gene replacement therapy in patients with FOXG1 syndrome should be carefully considered, especially in female patients.

">Aβ-42 sidechain deamidation at Q15 and N27 modulate protein aggregation and microglial responses via altered cytokine production and CD68 expression</a></h4>

              
                The progressive aggregation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) monomers into oligomers is a critical factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Although mutated forms of A{beta} have been shown to display altered aggregation dynamics, the specific effects of deamidated A{beta} on microglial function remain understudied. Our research group previously found that the deamidated variant A{beta}-42-N27D modified A{beta} aggregation, reduced neurotoxicity, and reduced microglial reactivity, but the impact of A{beta}-42 side chain deamidation in general on such parameters remained unclear. Here, we expanded on our prior work by investigating how two site-specific A{beta}-42 mutations (Q15E & N27D), where neutral amide side chains are replaced with negatively charged carboxylic acids, affect aggregation and microglial immune response using a mouse microglial cell line. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D exhibit distinct aggregation profiles compared to A{beta}-42 wild type (WT). Multiplexed analysis of 8 cytokines secreted into the culture medium revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IP-10, and MIP-1 relative to A{beta}-42-WT. Immunocytochemistry revealed that A{beta}-42-Q15E and A{beta}-42-N27D decrease CD68 expression relative to A{beta}-42-WT. These findings demonstrate that deamidation significantly alters A{beta}-42 aggregation and microglial activation, suggesting structural modifications to A{beta}-42 modulate inflammatory signaling in AD. This work provides a foundation for future studies on A{beta}-42 post-translational modifications as potential therapeutic targets in AD.

">Synapse-related protein alterations and estradiol deficiency associate with early Parkinsonism in female A53T-α-synuclein transgenic mice fed on a high-fat diet</a></h4>

              
                Substantial evidence highlights the detrimental impact of a fat-rich diet on cognitive and emotional behaviour. Epidemiological studies have linked the consumption of saturated fat with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas a low-fat or ketogenic diet is reported to improve both motor and non-motor symptoms. Several animal model studies further support these associations. However, the impact of a high-fat diet (HFD) on sex-specific behavioural alterations and the underlying molecular mechanism in PD remains poorly studied. In the present study, we investigated the impact of HFD on PD progression in a sex-specific manner using the A53T transgenic mouse model of PD. Behavioural and pathophysiological analyses revealed a faster onset and progression of PD-like phenotype in female mice exposed to HFD compared with the male mice. Proteomics profiling of brain tissues demonstrated positive enrichment of immune system-related pathways in males, while females exhibited considerable downregulation of synapse-associated pathways under HFD conditions. The reduced estradiol level was identified as a potential factor contributing to synaptic dysfunction and the subsequent early onset of PD in female mice. These findings provide novel insights into the sex-specific consequences of HFD on PD pathogenesis and highlight the role of estrogen-linked synaptic vulnerability in mediating diet-induced PD onset.

">Auditory network persistence of stimulus representation in awake and naturally sleeping mice</a></h4>

              
                Persistent neural activity often outlasts sensory stimulation, bridging perception and action. While commonly linked to working memory and decision making, its existence during passive states and sleep remains unclear. Using chronic high-density electrophysiology in freely behaving mice, we show that population spiking activity across the auditory cortical hierarchy enables decoding of past stimuli long after their offset, during both wakefulness and sleep. Time-resolved decoding revealed that in wakefulness, persistent representations decay uniformly across sensory and association cortices, whereas during sleep, persistence is prolonged in association cortex but remains brief in early auditory regions. Recurrent neural network modeling showed that higher internal noise during wakefulness reproduces this pattern, suggesting that reduced interference during sleep stabilizes sensory traces in associative areas. Our results demonstrate that persistent representation is a passive, state-dependent feature of sensory processing, supporting sensory maintenance even in the absence of active engagement.

">Multimodal Connectivity-based Cortical Segmentation with Graph Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Due to the significant amount of time and expertise needed for manual segmentation of the brain cortex from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, there is a substantial need for efficient and accurate algorithms to replace the need for human involvement. In this work, we explore the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to segment the brain surface based on structural brain connectivity. We train three different GNN architectures, the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), the Graph Attention Network (GAT), and the Graph U-Net, and evaluate their performances when trained on silver-standard cortical region labels created by FreeSurfer. We take a multimodal approach to brain segmentation by examining the influence of the structural connectivity values inferred from diffusion MRI (dMRI) in addition to using values from structural MRI (sMRI). Our results demonstrate the utility of GNN models, particularly the GAT architecture, which achieved Dice scores competitive to those reported in the literature with non-graph methods. Additionally, structural connectivity derived from dMRI revealed significant value in improving automatic segmentation, as models trained on combined attributes from dMRI and sMRI outperformed those trained only on sMRI. Finally, we compared the GNN-based and the FreeSurfer segmentations in their ability to predict demographic characteristics, where neither of the two approaches was statistically significantly superior to the other.

">Individual cortical neurons innervating large proportions of the neocortical areas in the MouseLight database</a></h4>

              
                The general notion of the extent of cortical areal interconnectivity in the neuroscience community can in part be due to results from traditional neuroanatomical studies, which later insights have shown to systematically represent underestimates of the extent of the axonal arborizations. But any underestimate of this interconnectivity could in turn be a factor in strengthening the notion of functional localization in the cortex, i.e. the idea that there are circumscribed cortical areas with specific functions that do not to a large extent depend on information being processed in other such cortical areas. Recent advances in neuroanatomical techniques have greatly improved the possibilities to follow the axonal projections of individual neurons in full, and many reconstructed neurons are made available by the MouseLight database. We sampled individual cortical neurons with the majority of their axons within the neocortex and explored the extent of their axonal connections. We found that the efferent axon of individual cortical neurons can commonly cover as much as 30-40% of all types of cortical areas, with a coverage of up to 80% for a single neuron also being demonstrated. Combining the distributions of the axonal trees of more than one cortical neuron, we found that as few as three neurons within one area could reach 100% of the other cortical areas.

">Associations Between Frailty and Cognitive Outcomes Across the Lifespan of Mice</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in monitoring biological and brain aging with precise measures of health and longevity have the potential to accelerate research on pharmacological, genetic, and aging-related interventions. Over the past decade, frailty index has been used as an assessment tool for rodents, evaluating more than 30 non-invasive parameters that are strongly associated with chronological age, correlated with mortality, and sensitive to lifespan-altering interventions. However, whether aging phenotypes captured by the frailty index reflect brain aging remains unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between frailty index and cognitive ability in young (3-4 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (24 months) male and female C57BL/6J mice using a battery of behavioral and locomotor assays to determine whether frailty index scores can predict performance in tasks evaluating behavioral and cognitive function. Among the behavioral assays tested, frailty index scores had good correlation with the percentage of time spent in the center of the open-field apparatus, the duration spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and the time spent in the target hole of the Barnes maze. These findings indicate that the frailty index not only reflects general physiological aging but may also serve as a reliable predictor of age-related cognitive decline in mice, providing a valuable tool for studies of interventions targeting brain aging.

">Neural Inflammation in Thoracic Dorsal Root Ganglia Mediates Cardiopulmonary Spinal Afferent Sensitization in Chronic Heart Failure</a></h4>

              
                The cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) and pulmonary spinal afferent reflex (PSAR) amplify sympathetic activity and may contribute to chronic heart failure (CHF). We hypothesized that neural inflammation in thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) drives cardiopulmonary afferent sensitization through suppression of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels after myocardial infarction (MI). MI was induced in rats by coronary ligation. Molecular profiling, immunofluorescence, tissue clearing, and functional assays were used to assess neuroinflammation and reflex responses. Post MI, thoracic DRGs showed macrophage infiltration, glial activation, cytokine upregulation, and reduced Kv channel expression. Bulk RNAseq identified enrichment of macrophage activation related genes, and in vitro studies confirmed that pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated macrophages suppressed Kv channels and increased DRG neuron excitability. Epicardial injection of biotinylated TNFalpha; demonstrated cardiac afferent mediated cytokine transport to DRGs, inducing macrophage infiltration via a cytokine receptor-dependent mechanism. Anti-inflammatory interventions including oral minocycline, systemic macrophage depletion, and local epidural delivery of thermoresponsive hydrogel forming dexamethasone prodrug (ProGel Dex) significantly reduced DRG neuroinflammation, restored Kv channel levels, and attenuated exaggerated CSAR and PSAR responses. ProGel Dex also improved cardiac chamber dilation in the post-MI rats. These findings identify a cytokine uptake/glial activation/macrophage activation pathway as a driver of cardiopulmonary afferent sensitization after MI. Targeting DRG inflammation, particularly with sustained local dexamethasone delivery using ProGel Dex, offers a precision medicine to dampen pathological sympathetic activation and improve cardiac outcomes in CHF.

">Infinite horizon control captures modulation of movement duration in reaching movements</a></h4>

              
                Movement duration, a fundamental aspect of motor control, is often viewed as a pre-programmed parameter requiring dedicated selection mechanisms. An alternative view posits that movement duration emerges from the control policy itself. Here, we demonstrate, using infinite horizon optimal feedback control (IHOFC) and nonlinear limb dynamics that this alternative hypothesis successfully captures diverse aspects of human reaching behavior, including tradeoffs between movement duration and task parameters. Specifically, we reproduced the modulation of movement duration with varying reach distances and accuracy (Fitts' law), and extended the infinite horizon framework to include the effect of rewards and biomechanical costs. Furthermore, our model also featured a temporal evolution of feedback responses to perturbations that resembles experimental observations, and naturally accounted for motor decisions observed when participants select one among multiple goals in dynamic environments. Together, these developments show that in many cases, movement duration may not need to be specified a priori, but instead could result from task-dependent control policies. This framework validates a candidate explanation for varied movement durations, which invites to reconsider the nature and strength of evidence for the finite horizon formulation.

">Is the whole more than the sum of its parts? Considering global and local features of the connectome improves prediction of individuals and phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Popular methods for analyzing the brain's functional connectome examine statistical associations between pairs of atlas-defined brain regions, viewing the strength of these links as independent values. However, edges within a standard connectivity matrix, i.e., correlations between individual regions or nodes, are not independent. They are part of an interconnected system. Here, we propose that consideration of both independent, linear relationships (as in standard approaches such as linear kernel ridge regression and connectome-based predictive modeling) as well as higher order statistical associations - such as tertiary interactions between matrix components and global features of the matrix space - will enhance identification of meaningful individual differences. To test this, we adopt a geometrically grounded measure of similarity that accounts for higher-order local statistical relationships and global interactions, the Wasserstein metric. Results indicate that considering connectivity matrices as representations of their associated Gaussian distributions significantly improves both identification of individuals based on their connectivity matrices (aka, 'fingerprinting') and prediction of individual differences in phenotypes such as fluid intelligence and openness to experience. Thus, both pairwise local and global brain connectivity properties encode for meaningful individual differences that relate to phenotypic expressions and should be considered in brain-behavior predictive models.

">Emotional amnesia in humans with focal temporal pole lesions</a></h4>

              
                Memory is typically better for emotional relative to neutral events, a process involving amygdala modulation of hippocampal activity. These structures, however, form part of a larger emotional brain network, which in humans includes the temporal pole, a cortical node whose functional role in emotional cognition remains poorly understood. Here, we show, in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy patients performing verbal and visual emotional episodic memory tasks, a selective impairment in recalling verbal emotional memories in left ventral temporal pole (vTP) lesioned patients compared with control patients. Memory for neutral words, and verbal comprehension performance on standard neuropsychological testing, were intact in these patients, indicating absence of general episodic memory or semantic impairment. All patients underwent recordings with intracranial electrodes during memory task performance. Left vTP lesioned patients showed no differences in amygdala or hippocampal electrophysiological responses to emotional words, compared with control patients, putatively isolating a vTP role in emotional memory. Unlike verbal emotional recall, left vTP lesioned patients showed memory enhancement for emotional vs. neutral pictures, whereas two patients with right vTP lesions showed the opposite pattern: impaired memory for emotional pictures but intact verbal emotional memory. These observations establish a critical, lateralized, modality-specific role for human vTP in emotional memory, imply emotional memory deficits in neurological conditions affecting this region, and advance the vTP as a target for neuromodulation in diseases characterized by maladaptive emotional memories.

">Abnormally increased intrinsic neural timescales in sensory and default mode networks in cocaine use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is associated with abnormal structural and functional brain changes. However, the neurodynamics and molecular underpinnings remain unclear. In this study, we mapped whole-brain intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), reflecting temporal neural processing, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 44 CUD patients and 44 healthy controls (HC). CUD showed increased INTs in visual, somatomotor, and default mode networks compared with HC. Mediation analysis linked local INTs abnormalities to altered dorsal attention network neurodynamics, associated with inhibitory control deficits. Notably, these changes were primarily correlated with alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and the noradrenaline transporter. Machine learning classifiers based on INTs achieved a maximum accuracy of 75.5% in distinguishing CUD from HC, with a generalization accuracy of 65.0% on an independent dataset. This study elucidates aberrant neural mechanisms underlying CUD and highlights INTs as promising diagnostic biomarkers for clinical detection and intervention.

">Discovery of Small Molecules and a Druggable Groove That Regulate DNA Binding and Release of the AP1 Transcription Factor DeltaFOSB</a></h4>

              
                DeltaFOSB, a member of the AP1 family of transcription factors, mediates long-term neuroadaptations underlying drug addiction, seizure-related cognitive decline, dyskinesias, and several other chronic conditions. AP1 transcription factors are notoriously difficult to modulate pharmacologically due to the absence of well-defined binding pockets. Here, we identify a novel site on deltaFOSB, located outside the DNA-binding cleft, that accommodates small molecules. We show that sulfonic acid-containing compounds bind to this site via an induced-fit mechanism, reorienting side chains critical for DNA binding, and that they may hinder the deltaFOSB bZIP alpha-helix from binding to the major groove of DNA. In vivo, direct administration of one such compound, JPC0661, into the brain reduces deltaFOSB occupancy at genomic AP1 consensus sites by approximately 60% as determined by CUT&RUN-sequencing. These findings suggest that DNA binding and release by AP1 transcription factors can be controlled via small molecules that dock into a novel site that falls outside of the DNA-binding cleft. Minimal sequence conservation across 29 bZIP domain-containing transcription factors in this druggable groove suggests that it can be exploited to develop AP1-subunit-selective compounds. Our studies thus reveal a novel strategy to design small-molecule inhibitors of deltaFOSB and other members of the bZIP transcription factor family.

">A unique neural signature of long-term memory encoding from EEG inter-electrode correlation</a></h4>

              
                Classic memory models proposed that the encoding process involved in visual working memory (VWM) controls the bandwidth of encoding in long-term memory (LTM). Behaviorally, VWM and LTM accuracies are reliably correlated at the behavioral level, raising the question of whether LTM encoding uniquely engages processes that are distinct from VWM encoding. To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity as participants completed recognition memory tasks with set sizes of 32 and 128, far beyond typical VWM capacity. Using interelectrode correlation (IC) analysis, we found that IC patterns reliably predicted individual differences in LTM encoding across both set sizes, indicating a robust, domain-general neural signature. Importantly, this predictive power remained even after controlling for VWM and attentional control performance, suggesting that the model captures variance specific to LTM encoding. Temporally, predictive signals emerged only after stimulus onset and persisted for 500-600 ms. Early and late encoding phases involved distinct network structures, reflecting dynamic neural processes underlying individual differences in LTM encoding. Together, our findings reveal a unique and temporally dynamic neural signature that supports individual differences in LTM encoding, independent of general cognitive abilities.

">Efficient in vivo pharmacological inhibition of deltaFOSB, an AP1 transcription factor, in brain</a></h4>

              
                DeltaFOSB, an unusually stable member of the AP1 family of transcription factors, mediates long-term maladaptations that play a key role in the pathogenesis of drug addiction, cognitive decline, dyskinesias, and several other chronic neurological and psychiatric conditions. We have recently identified that 2-phenoxybenzenesulfonic acid-containing compounds disrupt the binding of deltaFOSB to DNA in vitro in cell-based assays, and one such compound, JPC0661, disrupts deltaFOSB binding to genomic DNA in vivo in mouse brain with partial efficiency. JPC0661 binds to a groove outside of the DNA-binding cleft of the deltaFOSB/JUND bZIP heterodimer in the co-crystal structure. Here, we generated a panel of analogs of JPC0661 with the goal of establishing structure-activity relationships and improving its in vivo efficacy by replacing the amino-pyrazolone cap moiety with various substituents. We show that one such analog, YL0441, disrupts the binding of deltaFOSB to DNA in vitro and in vivo, and suppresses deltaFOSB-function in cell-based assays. Importantly, infusion of YL0441 into the hippocampus of APP mice (a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease) leads to virtually complete loss of deltaFOSB bound to genomic DNA by CUT&RUN sequencing. Our findings corroborate that DNA binding/release of AP1 transcription factors can be controlled via small molecules, even by analogs of a compound that binds to a groove outside of the DNA-binding cleft, and that our lead can be optimized via medicinal chemistry to yield a highly efficacious inhibitor of deltaFOSB function in vivo. These findings define a strategy to design small-molecule inhibitors for other AP1- and AP1-related transcription factors.

">BACE: Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation for Interpretable Graphs of Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many micro contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines. Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for each within trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase specific graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions during behavior.

">Bridging Histology and Tractography: First Visualization of the Short-Range Prefrontal Connections in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Decades of histological research in non-human primates have revealed a dense web of short-range connections underpinning prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. However, translating this anatomical ground-truth to the living human brain has been a major challenge, leaving our understanding of the PFC's intrinsic wiring incomplete. These short-range fibers are difficult to resolve with non-invasive methods like diffusion tractography, which are often hampered by false positives. Here, we provide the first systematic in-vivo visualization of these pathways in the human brain. By guiding high-resolution probabilistic tractography with established histological findings, we mapped the short-range connections within and between five major PFC subdivisions in 1,003 individuals (547 F, 456 M). Our anatomically-guided approach successfully reconstructed these intricate connections with high precision (>80%) and accuracy (>70%) relative to histological findings. The resulting tracts not only captured broad organizational principles but also replicated fine-grained patterns previously only seen in invasive studies. Furthermore, these connections showed high test-retest reliability within individuals alongside significant variability between them, highlighting a stable yet unique anatomical fingerprint. Ultimately, this study shows how linking histology to tractography provides a powerful framework to advance our understanding of the human connectome and opens avenues to investigate local circuitry that underpins cognition and disease.

">Canonical decision computations underlie behavioral and neural signatures of cooperation in primates</a></h4>

              
                Successful cooperation requires dynamic integration of social cues. However, the neural mechanisms supporting this complex process remain unknown. Here, we reveal that the primate dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) implements a gaze-dependent social evidence accumulation process to guide cooperative decisions in freely moving marmoset dyads. A drift-diffusion process in which the partner's action variability is accumulated by social gaze best explains the cooperative actions of the actor. Single-neuron recordings in dmPFC revealed a direct neural correlate: the slope of predictive ramping activity mapped directly onto the rate of evidence accumulation, while baseline firing, modulated by prior outcomes, mapped onto the initial bias. At the population level, the geometry of dmPFC neural trajectories reflected the strength of social evidence and was linked to cooperative success. Together, these findings establish a multi-level neural mechanism for transforming active sensing into a decision variable, linking a canonical computation to cooperative behavior in a naturalistic setting.

">Coupled rhythms in early auditory cortex mirror speech acoustics</a></h4>

              
                Theta and gamma neural dynamics dominate the human auditory cortex during speech perception and have been proposed to track syllable boundaries and encode phonemic information, respectively. To what extent these rhythms engage intrinsic mechanisms or mirror the phase and frequency of the speech acoustics remains unsolved. Applying signal processing techniques from neuroscience to speech audio corpora from 17 languages, we found that canonical brain features (theta, gamma, and their phase-amplitude coupling) are distinctive and visible in the speech envelope. They represent syllabic rate (between 2 and 6 Hz), vocalic features (between 30 and 50 Hz), and fundamental frequency (between 100 and 150 Hz). Intracerebral (sEEG) recordings from the auditory cortex of 18 epilepsy patients revealed that theta-gamma dynamics and their coupling are absent at rest but emerge during speech perception, linearly driven by the acoustic envelope. These responses originate from distinct neural populations within overlapping auditory regions. Thus, theta-gamma auditory dynamics primarily mirror speech acoustics rather than being generated by endogenous mechanisms.

">Expression and localization of NMDA receptor GluN2 subunits in dorsal horn pain circuits across sex, species, and late postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                Despite being essential mediators of pain processing, the molecular identity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subtypes in nociceptive dorsal horn circuits is poorly understood, especially between sexes and in humans. Given the importance of GluN2 subunits in shaping NMDAR function and plasticity, we investigated the expression and localization of specific GluN2 NMDAR variants in the dorsal horn of viable spinal cord tissue from male and female rodents and human organ donors. Analysis of single-cell/nuclei sequencing datasets revealed that the GluN2A (GRIN2A) and GluN2B (GRIN2B) subunits are robustly expressed in dorsal horn neurons of both mice and humans, with moderate expression of GluN2D (GRIN2D) and minimal expression of GluN2C (GRIN2C). Immunohistochemistry with antigen retrieval demonstrated that GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D proteins are all preferentially localized to the superficial dorsal horn of both adult rats and humans, which is conserved between males and females. Surprisingly, we found that these GluN2 NMDAR subunits are enriched in the lateral superficial dorsal horn for rats but not for humans, while presynaptic and neuronal markers are symmetrically distributed across the rat mediolateral axis. A dramatic shift in localization of GluN2A to the lateral superficial dorsal horn was observed across later postnatal development (PD21-PD90) in both male and female rats, with a corresponding change in synaptic NMDAR currents. This discovery of changes in NMDAR subunit distribution into rodent adulthood and between species will shed light on the physiological roles of NMDARs and their utility as potential therapeutic targets for pain.

">PSD-95 drives binocular vision maturation critical for predation</a></h4>

              
                Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is a signalling scaffold within the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses which drives silent synapse maturation during critical periods (CP). Binocularity develops during visual CPs and matures before its closure. Despite lifelong critical period plasticity, PSD-95 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit relatively subtle sensory phenotypes as adult mice in standard cage housing. To assess PSD-95s role in ethologically relevant binocular visual processing, we compared prey capture behaviour in PSD-95 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. KO mice were profoundly impaired in diverse epochs of predatory behaviour, but exhibited improved prey localisation under monocular conditions, indicating impaired binocular integration. This was confirmed in an orientation discrimination task, where KO mice were impaired binocularly but performed monocularly like WT mice. Our results depict a critical role of PSD-95 to drive binocular maturation which becomes evident under ethologically demanding behaviours.

">Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories</a></h4>

              
                One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting rewarding and aversive experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories and motivation. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes, and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of the fluorescent calcium indicator jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of Long-Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue-alcohol association, a mild foot shock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we trained rats to associate three different cues with either alcohol, foot-shock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, LH-GABA activity responds to an aversive shock stimulus, but this response is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations, and their interaction in conflict.

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/43/e0037252025?rss=1">A Neural Signature of the Bias Toward Self-Focus</a></h4>

              
                <p>People are remarkably self-focused, disproportionately choosing to think about themselves relative to other topics. Self-focus can be adaptive, helping individuals fulfill their needs. It can also be maladaptive, with self-focus a risk and maintenance factor for internalizing disorders like depression. Yet, the drive to focus on the self remains to be fully characterized. We discovered a brain pattern that when spontaneously brought online during a quick mental break predicts the desire to focus on oneself just a few seconds later. In Study 1 (19 female and 13 male human subjects), we identified a default network neural signature from pr-trial activity that predicts multiple indicators of self-focus within our sample. In Study 2 (588 female and 498 male human subjects), we applied our neural signature to independent resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project. We found that individuals who score high on internalizing, a form of maladaptive self-focus, similarly move in and out of this pattern during rest, suggesting a systematic trajectory toward self-focused thought. This is the first work to "decode" the bias to focus on the self and paves the way toward stopping maladaptive self-focus in its course.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, neuroprotection, and reprogramming of Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) into neurogenic MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the adult male and female mouse retina. We found that S1P-related genes were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. <I>S1pr1</I> (S1P receptor 1) and <I>Sphk1</I> (sphingosine kinase 1) are expressed at low levels by resting MG and are rapidly upregulated following acute damage. Overexpression of the neurogenic bHLH transcription factor Ascl1 in MG downregulates <I>S1pr1</I>, and inhibition of Sphk1 and S1pr1/3 enhances Ascl1-driven differentiation of bipolar-like cells. Treatments that activate S1pr1 or increase retinal levels of S1P initiate proinflammatory NFB signaling in MG, whereas treatments that inhibit S1pr1 or decreased levels of S1P suppress NFB signaling in MG. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of <I>S1pr1</I> in MG, but not <I>Sphk1</I>, enhances the accumulation of immune cells in damaged retinas. cKO of <I>S1pr1</I> promotes the survival of ganglion cells, whereas cKO of <I>Sphk1</I> promotes the survival amacrine cells in damaged retinas. Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatments that inhibit S1P receptors or inhibit Sphk1 have protective effects upon inner retinal neurons. We conclude that the S1P signaling pathway is activated in MG after damage and this pathway restricts the accumulation of immune cells, impairs neuron survival, and suppresses the reprogramming of MG into neurogenic progenitors in the adult mouse retina.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/43/e0199252025?rss=1">Involvement of the Endothelial N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor on Vessel-Associated Positioning and Differentiation of Cortical Oligodendrocytes and on Motor Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>During cortical development, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) attachment and detachment to microvessels play a crucial role in their positioning and differentiation. In the developing brain, endothelial cells are regionally diverse, and previous studies showed a peak in cortical endothelial NMDA receptor (eNMDAR) expression during perinatal life, coinciding with OPC migration along microvessels. This raises the hypothesis that eNMDAR might influence the fate of vessel-associated OPC. In this study, a Grin1<sup>lox/lox</sup>/VeCad<sup>Cre</sup> mouse model was used to investigate in females and males the effects of endothelial GluN1 invalidation (eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) on (1) positioning and differentiation of cortical oligodendrocytes and myelination, (2) OPC/microvessel association and endothelial MMP9-like activity, and (3) motor activity. Results showed that, from postnatal days (P) 2 to P15, PDGFR&alpha; expression was increased in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice and returned to wild-type levels by P45. CNPase and MBP expression was reduced at P15 and remained low in adult eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Histological analysis revealed no change in OPC&ndash;microvessel association, but positioning was altered with increased density in layers VI and V at P15. Myelination was impaired, as evidenced by thinner corpus callosum, reduced myelin sheath thickness, and higher g-ratio. Axonal mitochondria density was significantly increased. Functional tests revealed that glutamate could not stimulate endothelial MMP9-like activity in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Molecular, histological and functional changes were linked to sensorimotor disabilities. At P45, despite the absence of observable myelination defects, locomotor impairments persisted, suggesting that early OPC differentiation disruption contributes to lasting motor dysfunction. These findings offer new insights into OPC vulnerability in human preterm infants.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are complex phenomena governed by genetics, neurophysiology, environment, and societal structures. New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing personalized interventional strategies. Here, we used a two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha3 (<I>chrna3</I>) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish, of either sex, prior to complete sex differentiation, were examined in this study. They exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate exposure to alcohol. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behavior. Exposure to low concentration of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviors, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, these responses are blunted in <I>chrna3</I> mutants. They exhibited prolonged alcohol self-administration and increased gregariousness. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission alongside cholinergic signaling is impacted in the mutant brains. Our results thus suggest that <I>chrna3</I> dysfunction has a systemic change with an increase in alcohol tolerance being one effect. These findings also highlight the use of nonrodent alternatives to understand the neurogenetics of development of AUD.</p>

                <p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs) and fine-tunes gene expression by targeting RNA transcripts with other NMD inducing features. This study demonstrates that conditional knock-out of <I>Smg5</I>, a key NMD component, in oligodendrocyte lineage cells disrupts the degradation of PTC-containing transcripts, including aberrant variants of the RNA-binding protein <I>Hnrnpl</I>. The loss of SMG5 in both sexes of mice impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation, reduced myelin gene expression, and led to thinner myelin sheaths and compromised motor function in mice. Mechanistically, HNRNPL was shown to regulate the alternative splicing of myelin-associated genes <I>Mag</I> and <I>Nfasc</I> and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. These findings reveal that SMG5-mediated NMD ensures RNA processing fidelity essential for proper oligodendrocyte development and CNS myelination.</p>

                <p>Following injury, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity, whereas the central nervous system (CNS) has limited regenerative potential. This difference is partially attributed to distinct postinjury myelin breakdown. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this disparity remain unclear. By comparing the expression profiles of injured peripheral and central nerves in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice, we identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) as a key regulator that determines the differences in myelin breakdown between the injured PNS and CNS. Schwann cell-derived IGFBP2 in the injured PNS promotes myelin breakdown and facilitates axonal regeneration. Furthermore, through lipidomics, we identify ceramide, a sphingolipid regulated by ceramide synthase 6 in injured nerves, as playing a critical role in IGFBP2-mediated myelin breakdown. Conversely, minimal IGFBP2 expression is observed in the injured CNS, contributing to the limited myelin breakdown and axon regeneration in injured CNS. These findings provide insights into the divergent regenerative potential of the PNS and CNS and unveil IGFBP2 and ceramide as promising targets for promoting CNS regeneration after injury.</p>

                <p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>

                <p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>

                <p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>

                <p>Presenilin mutations are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), but the mechanisms by which they disrupt neuronal function remain unresolved, particularly in relation to -secretase activity. Using <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, we show that the presenilin ortholog SEL-12 supports synaptic transmission and axonal integrity through a pathway involving the ryanodine receptor RYR-1. Loss-of-function mutations in either <I>sel-12</I> or <I>ryr-1</I> reduce neurotransmitter release and cause neuronal structural defects, with no additional impairment in double mutants, suggesting a shared pathway. Transgenic expression of a -secretase&ndash;inactive SEL-12 variant or human presenilin 1 restores normal synaptic transmission in <I>sel-12</I> mutants. Notably, <I>sel-12</I> loss does not alter <I>ryr-1</I> transcript or protein levels. These findings define a novel -secretase&ndash;independent role of presenilin in maintaining neuronal function via ryanodine receptor signaling, providing new mechanistic insight into presenilin-linked neurodegeneration and pointing to potential therapeutic strategies for FAD.</p>

                <p>Stress is a potent trigger for drug-seeking behaviors in both rodents and humans with a history of substance use. Kappa opioid receptors (kORs) play a critical role in mediating stress responses. Our previous studies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) demonstrated that acute stress activates kORs to block long-term potentiation at GABA<SUB>A</SUB> synapses on dopamine neurons (LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB>) and triggers stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Here we identify the specific GABAergic afferents affected by stress, the precise localization of kORs within the VTA, and show that VTA kOR activation is sufficient to drive reinstatement. In male and female mice, we optogenetically activated specific GABAergic afferents and found that nucleus accumbens (NAc)-to-VTA, but not lateral hypothalamus-to-VTA projections, exhibit stress-sensitive LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB>. Using a conditional knock-out approach, we found that selectively deleting kORs from NAc neurons but not from dopamine cells prevents stress-induced block of LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB>. Selectively activating dynorphin-containing NAc neurons with an excitatory DREADD mimics acute stress, preventing LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB> at VTA synapses. We furthermore demonstrated that without acute stress, microinjection of a selective kOR agonist directly into the VTA of male rats facilitates cocaine reinstatement without similarly affecting sucrose-motivated responding, demonstrating the critical role of kORs in stress-induced cocaine reinstatement. Our results show that kORs on GABAergic NAc nerve terminals in the VTA underlie loss of LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB> that may drive stress-induced addiction&ndash;related behaviors. Our work highlights the importance of inhibitory inputs for controlling dopamine neuron excitability in the context of addiction and contributes to defining the circuit involved in stress-induced drug reinstatement.</p>

                <p>The work of Hubel and Wiesel has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of V1, leading to modeling neural responses as cascades of linear and nonlinear processes in what is known as the "standard model" of vision. Under this formulation, however, some dendritic properties cannot be represented in a practical manner, while evidence from both experimental and theoretical work indicates that dendritic processes are an indispensable element of key neural behaviors. As a result, current V1 models fail to explain neural responses in a number of scenarios. In this work, we propose an implicit model for V1 that considers nonlinear dendritic integration and backpropagation of action potentials from the soma to the dendrites. Our model can be viewed as an extension of the standard model that minimizes an energy function, allows for a better conceptual understanding of neural processes, and explains several neurophysiological phenomena that have challenged classical approaches.</p>

                <p>Preventing deception requires understanding how lie detectors process social information across social distance. Although the outcomes of such information are crucial, how detectors evaluate gains or losses from close versus distant others remains unclear. Using a sender&ndash;receiver paradigm and functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning, we recruited 66 healthy adult dyads (32 male and 34 female dyads) to investigate how perceived social distance modulates the neural basis in receivers (the detector) during deceptive gain/loss evaluation. The results showed that detectors were more prone to deception in gain contexts, with these differences mediated by connectivity in risk evaluation (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), reward-processing (orbitofrontal cortex, OFC), and intention-understanding regions (frontal pole area). Hyperscanning analyses revealed that friend dyads exhibited higher interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) in these regions than stranger dyads. In gain contexts, friend dyads showed enhanced INS in the OFC, whereas in loss contexts, enhanced INS was observed in the DLPFC. Trial-level analysis revealed that the INS during the current trial effectively predicted the successful deception of that trial. We constructed a series of regression models and found that INS provides superior predictive power over single-brain measures. The INS-based support vector regression model achieved an accuracy of 86.66% in predicting deception. This indicates that increased trust at closer social distances reduces vigilance and fosters relationship-oriented social information processing. As the first to identify INS as a neural marker for deception from the detector's perspective, this work advances interpersonal deception theory and offers a neuroscientific basis for credit risk management.</p>

                <p>Studying locomotor activity in animal models is crucial for understanding physiological, behavioral, and pathological processes. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence-based tracking system called Goblotrop, designed to localize rodents within their laboratory environment. The Goblotrop system uses two infrared cameras to record videos of rodents in their home cages. A neural network analyzes these videos to determine the rodent's position at each time point. By tracking changes in position over time, the system provides detailed insights into rodent behavior, including speed, mobility, and climbing activity. To evaluate the system's reliability, we utilized a starvation-induced hyperactivity model, employed as a female mouse model for anorexia nervosa. This model is characterized by pronounced hyperactivity, typically assessed using electronically monitored running wheels. Both the Goblotrop system and running wheel measurements demonstrated that starvation increases food-anticipatory activity (up to 4&nbsp;h before food availability) while reducing nocturnal activity. The results from the Goblotrop system and running wheel measurements exhibited remarkable consistency. Thus, the Goblotrop system proves to be a valuable tool for studying locomotor activity and circadian rhythms in different cage areas in animal models. This tool provides potential for various scientific fields, including neuroscience, pharmacology, toxicology, and behavioral research.</p>

                <p>Recent investigations have revealed that selective attention to lateralized speech increases ipsilateral tonic electromyographic activity in the vestigial human auriculomotor system. However, it has yet to be determined whether this modulation depends upon predictive cues that are inherent in continuous speech or whether it is a general concomitant of selective attention to sounds in the auditory periphery. The present study addressed this question by replacing speech with randomized, unpredictable sequences of brief tonal stimuli in a dichotic listening task that necessitated a sustained anticipatory focus of attention. Participants (8 female, 23 male) were presented with sequences of brief tone bursts in one ear and frequency-modulated "chirps" in the other ear and were instructed to focus on sounds in one ear and report attenuated deviant stimuli in that ear. Posterior auricular muscle (PAM) activity was recorded behind both ears, and non-rectified stimulus-locked responses were assessed to ensure the reliability of PAM activity. Recordings of non-stimulus-locked rectified activity indicated that ipsilateral tonic PAM amplitudes were elevated when same-side sounds were attended, and follow-up analyses demonstrated that these modulations were independent of sound-evoked PAM reflexes. These findings provide evidence that this ipsilateral tonic increase in PAM activity is generally present in scenarios of lateralized selective listening and not reliant on predictive linguistic cues that may facilitate tracking of the attended stream. Due to its accessibility and capability of decoding the spatial focus of attention, this PAM modulation could support the development of intelligent hearing devices that maximize sensitivity toward a user&rsquo;s listening goals.</p>

                This paper presents a synthetic dataset to study the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSC) simulations using the simulation tool SCAPS-1D. The dataset consists of 18.570 simulated devices generated from four baseline device architectures and their respective photovoltaic performance values. The data set was generated through numerical simulations, and the evaluation of the electrical performance of the device was carried out by studying current density-voltage (J-V) curves under standard illumination conditions, temperature, and maximum applied voltage as working conditions, which were not modified. The dataset can be used to train different machine learning (ML) models using supervised methods or unsupervised techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, which facilitate the identification of patterns or relationships between parameters. Thus, it can be useful in reverse design strategies to determine optimal configurations based on defined objectives. This work contributes to the development of PSC by providing a broad dataset for further analysis and optimization.

                Background Chronic migraine is frequently refractory to available preventive therapies. Image-guided cryoneurolysis of the greater occipital nerve (CryoGON) may provide longer-lasting relief than conventional greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. This Stage 1 Registered Report describes a prospective, exploratory study evaluating whether response to a conventional GON block predicts subsequent response to CryoGON, and assesses open-label safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of CryoGON. Methods The study is planned as a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical investigation. Adults with chronic migraine will complete a ≥28-day electronic baseline diary before receiving bilateral conventional GON blocks, followed by a ≥28-day observation. Eligible participants then undergo navigation-guided CryoGON with 12-week follow-up. The primary endpoint is the association between change in moderate-to-severe headache days after GON block (weeks 1–4) and after CryoGON (weeks 9–12). Key secondary endpoints estimate the diagnostic performance of GON-block response applying a ≥30% reduction threshold for treatment effect to identify CryoGON responders, including sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Additional endpoints include change in migraine days, patient-reported global impression of change, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1, procedure tolerability, technical success, and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse device effects). Women of childbearing potential, including pregnant and breastfeeding participants, are eligible for participation. Discussion This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of whether a simple, widely available GON block can guide patient selection for CryoGON and will generate foundational open-label data on its clinical performance and safety. Findings will inform the design and justification of a subsequent sham-controlled trial. Trial registration and approvals The study will preregister at ClinicalTrials.gov. and obtain all necessary ethical approvals before study initiation.

                This opinion article examines the convergence between artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification in learning environments, with an emphasis on deep gamification designs aimed at creating interactive and meaningful experiences that transcend extrinsic motivation. The introduction sets the context by presenting AI as a tool that must be critically analyzed within the framework of critical pedagogy, which underscores the importance of adopting technology reflectively, placing the student at the center, and responding to the real needs of the community. The body of the article develops this claim: the integration of artificial intelligence into deep gamification designs can contribute to genuine educational transformation, provided that such integration is guided by critical pedagogical principles and maintains a balance between the potential of technology and the formative power of teaching practices. Arguments related to this claim are provided, including the use of AI in gamified designs to create personalized learning experiences based on students’ needs, rhythms, and learning styles; to transform the way students learn; to offer new educational resources; to adapt elements such as difficulty levels, challenges, and feedback in real time; and to develop engaging learning systems that lead to better academic outcomes. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of instructors utilizing critical pedagogy to direct AI-optimized gamification designs by incorporating culture, creativity, and critical awareness as pillars of educational transformation. This approach enables the surmounting of the obstacles presented by this synergy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-760/v2?src=rss">A bibliometric review of research on resilience, motivation and prisoners, 1912-2024 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research on resilience and motivation among incarcerated individuals has gained increasing academic interest due to its relevance in rehabilitation, reducing recidivism, and promoting societal reintegration. Prisoners often face psychological distress, social isolation, and behavioral challenges, making resilience and motivation essential for enduring incarceration and engaging in rehabilitative efforts. However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis that maps the evolution, influence, and thematic development of this research area remains limited. Methods This study aims to examine publication trends, key contributors, major thematic domains, and intellectual structures in resilience and motivation research related to prisoners from 1912 to 2024. Using Scopus-indexed literature, a bibliometric analysis was conducted employing co-authorship networks, keyword co-occurrence, and citation analysis to assess research output, collaboration patterns, and thematic progression. Results Findings reveal a significant surge in research since the early 2000s, with the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany leading in publication volume. Keyword analysis identifies four dominant thematic clusters: psychological resilience and coping, addiction rehabilitation, post-incarceration reintegration strategies, and decision-making within correctional environments. Citation analysis highlights pivotal works that have shaped the field, reflecting a shift from punitive correctional models toward rehabilitative, psychological, and policy-oriented approaches. Despite advancements, gaps remain in cross-cultural perspectives, gender-specific interventions, and post-release support systems. Conclusions The findings underscore the need for global collaboration, interdisciplinary approaches, and innovative rehabilitation strategies to advance resilience and motivation research in correctional contexts. This review contributes to the development of evidence-based policies, correctional education, and rehabilitation frameworks aimed at improving prisoner well-being, reducing recidivism, and fostering successful reintegration into society.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1155/v1?src=rss">Quality of Life and Sexual Health in Patients with Behçet’s Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Tunisian Cohort [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic, inflammatory disorder with unpredictable relapses. It can significantly impair quality of life (QoL) and sexual function, but data on these outcomes remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate QoL and sexual function in patients followed for BD and identify associated clinical factors. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, monocentric study involving 35 adult patients with BD, diagnosed according to the 2013 International Criteria. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were collected. Disease activity was measured using the Behçet’s Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF). Quality of life was assessed with the SF-36 and the Behçet’s Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (BD-QoL). Sexual function was evaluated using the IIEF-5 for men and the FSFI for women. Statistical analyses included correlations, group comparisons, and assessment of associations with clinical factors. Results Participants had a mean age of 45.3, with 74.3 % male. Common manifestations included oral ulcers (97 %), articular involvement (54 %), ocular lesions (40 %), and vascular involvement (34 %). Impaired QoL was identified in 66 % of patients via SF-36 and 40 % via BD-QoL. SF-36 and BD-QoL scores were strongly inversely correlated (p < 0.001). Higher disease activity, ocular and vascular involvement, elevated inflammatory markers, and comorbidities were significantly associated with poorer QoL. Erectile dysfunction occurred in 82.6 % of men and sexual dysfunction in 71.4 % of women; vascular involvement was significantly associated with male erectile dysfunction (p = 0.024). Conclusions BD imposes a substantial negative impact on quality of life and sexual health. Disease activity, particular organ involvement, inflammation, and comorbidities are key determinants of reduced QoL. Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent, notably among men with vascular involvement. These findings support the need for routine QoL and sexual health assessments in BD and for integrated multidisciplinary care to address these concerns.

                Purpose Research on inhibitors that hinder the progress of startups and their underlying motivators is increasingly gaining prominence in contemporary times. Encouraging and assisting start-up businesses to generate more employment has become an increasingly important issue at the global level. Methods This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of the scholarly literature pertaining to the drivers that motivate entrepreneurs and the inhibitors that influence their entrepreneurial activity. The gathered information was extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases from 1991 to 2020 (three decades). R-studio was used for initial data analysis, citation and co-citation analysis, and bibliographic coupling with co-authoring. Findings The study found that the pace of start-up research has been increasing since 2009, with a mean citation per document of 30.24. During the analysis, we identified that the most contributing countries producing the maximum number of research articles on entrepreneurship are the USA, the Netherlands, Germany, China, and France. The Journal of Business Venturing produced the maximum number of research articles, followed by international entrepreneurship and management journal. Originality/value This study aims to enrich our understanding of the content and structure related to startups and how it is presented in the literature. In contrast to recent advancements in entrepreneurial drivers and inhibitors, the current study exhibits a higher level of comprehensiveness regarding the methodologies and utilized databases. The findings of this study make a valuable contribution to the existing body of literature on the factors that drive and hinder entrepreneurship.

                Background As lung cancer treatment has progressed, there has been an increase in awareness of the short- and long-term adverse effects of targeted cancer therapies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly cardiovascular toxicities. Methods The current study assessed the potential drug-drug interactions using interaction checkers (IBM Micromedex and Drugs.com). Molecular docking was employed to further investigate the involvement of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) proteins to elucidate their potential interactions and their underlying mechanisms. Results A total of 74 pharmacokinetic and 105 pharmacodynamic interactions were detected between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs, along with a report on the severity and level of documentation. A considerable fraction of molecular modelling outcomes concurred with information from drug-drug interaction checkers. The binding energies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hERG and PXR were high, indicating significant interactions. The cardiovascular drug class encompasses calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medicines, and statins, which were observed to exhibit synergistic interactions. The identification of these potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4, P-gp, and hERG proteins can be utilized in therapy optimization in clinical settings. Conclusion This study will aid clinicians in designing safe dosage regimens for patients with lung cancer. In cases where patients have multiple comorbidities, it is essential to study the clinical aspects to design efficient chemotherapy and manage adverse effects and toxicities.

                <p>by David P. Shorten, Viola Priesemann, Michael Wibral, Joseph T. Lizier</p>

When analysing high-dimensional time-series datasets, the inference of effective networks has proven to be a valuable modelling technique. This technique produces networks where each target node is associated with a set of source nodes that are capable of providing explanatory power for its dynamics. Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) has proven to be a popular and effective tool for inferring these networks. Recently, a continuous-time estimator of TE for event-based data such as spike trains has been developed which, in more efficiently representing event data in terms of inter-event intervals, is significantly more capable of measuring multivariate interactions. The new estimator thus presents an opportunity to more effectively use TE for the inference of effective networks from spike trains, and we demonstrate in this paper for the first time its efficacy at this task. Using data generated from models of spiking neurons—for which the ground-truth connectivity is known—we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach in various dynamical regimes. We further show that it exhibits far superior inference performance to a pairwise TE-based approach as well as a recently-proposed convolutional neural network approach. Moreover, comparison with Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which are commonly applied to spike-train data, showed clear benefits, particularly in cases of high synchrony. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in revealing the patterns by which effective connections develop from recordings of developing neural cell cultures.

                <p>by Ying Joey Zhou, Mats W. J. van Es, Saskia Haegens</p>

Why do we sometimes perceive a faint stimulus but miss it at other times? One explanation is that fluctuations in the brain’s internal state result in variability in perception. Ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha band (8–13 Hz), crucial in setting the internal state of the brain, have been shown as a key contributor to such perceptual variability. However, findings on how alpha oscillations modulate perceptual variability have been mixed. Some studies suggested alpha modulates perceptual criterion (<i>c</i>), shifting the threshold for interpreting sensory information; while others suggested alpha modulates sensitivity (<i>d′</i>), changing the precision of sensory encoding. Moreover, most studies have focused solely on overall alpha activity—whether within a region of interest or across the whole brain—and overlooked the coexistence of multiple distinct alpha networks, leaving it unclear whether different alpha networks contribute differently to perception. Here, to characterize how different alpha networks influence perceptual decision-making, we analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded while human participants performed a visual detection task with threshold-level stimuli. We found that while the visual alpha network modulates sensitivity, the sensorimotor alpha network modulates criterion in perceptual decision-making. These findings reconcile previous conflicting results and highlight the functional diversity of alpha networks in shaping perception.

                <p>by Wakiko Iwata, Nora Haggerty, Hiromi Sesaki, Miho Iijima</p>

Mitochondrial division and fusion are critical regulators of cancer cell metabolism, proliferation, survival, metastasis, and drug resistance. Division promotes tumor development by reprogramming energy metabolism, whereas its inhibition can suppress tumor growth and metastasis. The mechanochemical GTPase DRP1, a key mediator of mitochondrial division, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Mitochondrial cristae also contribute to cancer progression by modulating metabolic reprogramming and oncogenic signaling. Targeting these processes may stimulate anti-tumor innate immune responses through the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm. A deeper understanding of tumor-specific mitochondrial membrane structures and dynamics could therefore reveal novel intervention strategies and guide precision cancer therapies.

                <p>by Manasvi Balachandran, Rohini Chatterjee, Ishaan Chaudhary, Chinmaya Jena, Nishad Matange</p>

Pathways of intrinsic resistance in bacteria are promising targets for novel antibiotics and resistance breakers. Here, we used a genome-wide screen to identify single gene knockouts of <i>Escherichia coli</i> that were hypersusceptible to trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, two chemically diverse broad-spectrum antibiotics. Among the hits from our screen, knockouts of <i>acrB</i>, an efflux pump, and <i>rfaG</i> or <i>lpxM</i>, both involved in cell envelope biogenesis, were hypersensitive to multiple antimicrobials and could sensitize genetically resistant <i>E. coli</i> strains to antibiotics. Using experimental evolution under trimethoprim pressure, we show that high drug selection regimes drove these knockouts to extinction more frequently than wild type. Among them, Δ<i>acrB</i> was most compromised in its ability to evolve resistance, establishing it as a promising target for “resistance proofing.” At a sub-inhibitory trimethoprim concentration, however, all three knockouts adapted to the antibiotic and consequently recovered from hypersensitivity, albeit to different extents. This recovery was driven by mutations in drug-specific resistance pathways, rather than compensatory evolution, frequently involving upregulation of the drug target. Notably, resistance-conferring mutations could by-pass defects in cell wall biosynthesis more effectively than efflux even though resistant mutations did not directly engage either pathway. Since inhibiting drug-efflux emerged as a better strategy, we tested the ability of chlorpromazine, an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), to resistance proof <i>E. coli</i> against trimethoprim. While qualitatively similar in the short term, genetic and pharmacological inhibition differed dramatically on an evolutionary time scale due to evolution of resistance to the EPI. Further, adaptation to the EPI-antibiotic pair also led to multidrug adaptation. The lack of concordance between genetic and pharmacological inhibition revealed a crucial lacuna in our understanding of the mutational repertoires that facilitate adaptation to antibiotics in bacteria. We propose that while intrinsic resistance mechanisms are effective targets for antibiotic sensitization, rapid evolutionary recovery may significantly limit their utility.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) was once considered a static neural event following resolution of acute injuries, numerous studies now demonstrate progressive losses to volume and white matter integrity in the months and years postinjury, leading to a paradigm shift in our understanding. These findings have yet to be synthesized. Therefore, our objective was to assimilate longitudinal studies of chronic msTBI to better elucidate the scale and timelines of neurodegeneration, regions of vulnerability, and ongoing gaps in the literature.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>As per our published systematic review protocol (see PROSPERO CRD42019117548), 6 electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2024. Included studies examined adults (&gt; 17) with msTBI, were longitudinal with first acquisition at least 2 months postinjury, and reported whole brain and/or regional volumetrics or fractional anisotropy (FA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 studies, with and without controls, and computed annualized percent change for the limited studies with overlapping regions and timelines with sufficient data. Overall, widespread progressive volumetric and FA losses were observed, with no evidence of accelerated progression across time. No volumetric but some FA increases (predominantly nonsignificant) were observed. Annualized percent changes in ascending order were: total grey matter volume (−0.28%), total white matter volume (−0.65%), hippocampal volume (−1.98%, bilaterally), and corpus callosum FA (−3.15%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Gaps in our understanding include mechanisms of degeneration, whether progressive losses remain constant or attenuate with time, and how patterns vary by region. Longitudinal research with 3 timepoints, standardized reporting, and additional outcome modalities (eg, functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], and blood biomarkers) would refine our understanding and inform treatment research.

<p>This final part 3 review builds on the practical applications discussed in part 2 and explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming data management, neurological education, and neurological care across large healthcare networks and datasets. The review also highlights AI's role in real-world and synthetic data, digital twins, and innovative clinical trial designs, such as in silico and adaptive trials. The review emphasizes AI's ability to drive continuous improvements in care and discovery through comparative effectiveness research and learning health systems. The global healthcare implications discussed here tie back to earlier discussions on human-AI collaboration and precision care, underscoring the neurological sciences' responsibility to adopt AI advances judiciously, while managing their ethical, economic, and environmental impacts.

                <p><i>SCN3B</i> encodes the β3 auxiliary subunit, essential for voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) channel trafficking and gating. Although <i>SCN3B</i> has been associated with cardiac disorders, a link with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) has not been established. Using a genotype-first approach, we identified homozygous truncating variants (c.281G&gt;A-β3<sup>W94*</sup>, c.584 + 1G&gt;A-β3<sup>S196*</sup>) in 2 consanguineous Pakistani families, leading to global developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism, with severe cognitive impairment, ataxia, and seizures in the case of β3<sup>W94*</sup>. Electrophysiological analysis revealed subtype-specific gating alterations on multiple brain Nav channel subtypes. This is the first report linking <i>SCN3B</i> mutations to NDD, expanding our understanding of Nav channelopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:864–870</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Prospective studies demonstrated that essential tremor is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Identifying clinical markers for conversion from essential tremor to essential tremor-Parkinson's disease would be of considerable value. Rest tremor can be present in advanced essential tremor and may be a harbinger of conversion. We examined (1) the brain distribution and severity of Lewy pathology and (2) whether patients met pathologically based criteria for Lewy body disease in relation to (1) the presence and severity of isolated rest tremor and (2) the diagnosis of essential tremor-Parkinson's disease during life.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two hundred one essential tremor brains in the Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository underwent deep clinical phenotyping and complete neuropathological assessment, including assessment of Lewy pathology with α-synuclein immunostaining.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Clinical diagnoses were essential tremor (93.5%), essential tremor with possible Parkinson's disease (3.5%), and essential tremor-Parkinson's disease (3.0%). Among 188 with essential tremor, 90 (47.9%) had rest tremor; 75.6% with rest tremor did not have Lewy pathology and 80% were not assigned pathological diagnoses of Lewy body disease. Rest tremor increased the odds of a pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disease (odds ratios = 1.98–2.73), but its positive predictive value was only 20.0 to 25.6%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In clinical practice, isolated rest tremor should be viewed as a finding that is associated with increased odds of Parkinson's disease but not, in the large majority of cases, indicative of underlying Lewy body disease. Our quantitative data can be conveyed to patients to provide prognostic information in discussions of risk stratification. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:741–749</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to determine patient, disease, and treatment characteristics associated with outcome in patients with primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) in a large multicenter German cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a retrospective, observational cohort study, we analyzed 163 adult patients who met the diagnostic criteria for PACNS. Data were collected from January 2004 to December 2018 in 13 tertiary care centers in Germany. Survival, recurrence-free survival and long-term global disability were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 163 patients with PACNS (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age 48 [39–59.5] years; 73 [45%] women), 29 (18%) died, 84 (52%) had a poor outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 3–6 at last follow-up), and 82 (50%) patients relapsed. Poorer survival was associated with patient age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41–2.74] per 10 years), longer time between initial manifestation and diagnosis (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00–1.01] per month), and necrotizing subtype (HR, 10.2 [95% CI, 2.18–48.2]). Long-term disability was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.07–1.86] per 10 years), and worse mRS score at diagnosis (OR, 4.43 [95% CI, 1.97–10.4]). Patients treated with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with steroids had a lower incidence of relapse than untreated patients (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.22–0.86]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.92]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with PACNS, the long-term outcome depends on several patient and disease characteristics. Our results favor treatment with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with steroids, because this was associated with a reduction in the relapse rate.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27303?af=R">Intravenous Thrombolysis Use before Inter‐Facility Transfer for Thrombectomy: Association with Efficacy and Safety Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion (LVO) often require transfer from primary stroke centers (PSCs) to thrombectomy-capable centers. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) initiated before inter-hospital transfer.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 2 prospective cohorts of patients with anterior circulation LVO transferred for thrombectomy from a PSC, regardless of whether thrombectomy was eventually attempted at the endovascular-capable center, were analyzed. Efficacy outcomes included good 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] = 0–2), excellent functional outcome (mRS = 0–1), and arterial recanalization during transfer. Safety outcomes included any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic ICH (sICH) at 24 hours. Propensity score with overlap weighting balanced the covariates between patients treated with IVT versus those without.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 521 patients, 260 (50%) received IVT before transfer. IVT was withheld mainly due to being outside the 4.5-hour window (58%) or anticoagulant use (21%). Median age was 72 years, 55% were men, and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 15. After propensity score with overlap weighting, patients receiving IVT more frequently had good functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43–3.30, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), excellent functional outcome (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.21–3.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and inter-facility recanalization (OR = 5.64, 95% CI = 2.92–10.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) compared with patients not treated with IVT. Any ICH (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.76–1.70) and sICH (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.36–1.51) rates were similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IVT before transfer was associated with improved recanalization and functional outcomes without increasing safety risks but is used in only 50% of patients. Expanding IVT criteria, including treatment beyond 4.5 hours and in anticoagulated patients, should be explored. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:871–880</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The possible impact of meningeal μ-opioid receptor (μOR) binding in migraine remains unknown. This study investigated μOR availability in the cranial parameninges involved in migraine initiation via nociceptor activation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used positron emission tomography with [<sup>11</sup>C] carfentanil, and measured μOR availability in meninges and adjacent skull bone (parameningeal tissue [PMT]) under resting and sustained thermal pain threshold stress challenge conditions. μOR availability was compared between individuals with migraine in interictal and ictal phases and healthy controls. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between μOR availability and headache intensity, as well as the potential influence of sex on this measure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 36 patients with interictal episodic migraine (8 also assessed ictally), 7 patients with ictal chronic migraine, and 22 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Both the episodic migraine and chronic migraine groups showed lower μOR availability in the parietal PMT than healthy controls during the ictal resting phase. No significant differences were observed during the interictal phase. Exploratory analyses on the effects of sex indicated that both healthy women and migraine patients of both sexes showed lower μOR availability in the frontal PMT compared with healthy men in the ictal sustained thermal pain threshold stress condition. Furthermore, the interictal μOR availability in the frontal PMT was negatively associated with headache intensity in the preceding month.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed variability in PMT μOR availability across the different cortical regions and migraine episodes, along with its association with pain intensity, underscores the critical role of extracerebral mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:777–787</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27292?af=R">α‐Synuclein‐Related Mitochondria‐Nrf2 Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease Olfactory Mucosa</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to outline the dynamics of the mitochondrial network and cytoprotective response in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)-derived olfactory mucosa neurons (ONs) at different disease stages.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONs obtained by nasal brush from 41 well-phenotyped patients with PD (n = 24 PD de novo [PD<sup>dn</sup>] and n = 17 under treatment [PD<sup>tr</sup>]) and 29 healthy controls were examined through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Western blot. An integrative set of experiments using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was also performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD ONs accumulated α-synuclein oligomers in association with an aberrant subcellular distribution of mitochondrial markers COX IV and HSP60. DJ-1 ONs expression was permanently reduced in PD, revealing the mitochondrial dysfunction and justifying the defective Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective response. The Nrf2/SOD-1 pathway was indeed downregulated in PD ONs, although with stage-specific differences. In PD<sup>dn</sup> ONs, Nrf2 mostly presented in the inactive cytosolic localization with a major reduction of SOD-1 expression, whereas in PD<sup>tr</sup>, the Nrf2 active nuclear fraction increased, and the SOD-1 expression raised. In SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrated that dopamine administration increases the Nrf2 nuclear fraction, acting as a possible pathway's inducer.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Human-derived ONs may recapitulate PD pathogenic milestones, exhibiting stage-specific interactions among α-synuclein oligomers, mitochondrial metabolism, and cytoprotective response. These findings highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary target for therapeutic interventions and a potential axis for the biological stratification of patients. Moreover, they supported the translational value of ONs, as a source of biomarkers or models, which is critical in the current changing paradigm of PD toward a biological-based approach.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dentatorubral–pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of cytosine–adenine–guanine repeats in <i>ATN1</i>. Most studies on DRPLA to date are limited to case reports. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical, genetic, biological, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of DRPLA using cross-sectional baseline data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a cross-sectional observational cohort study. We used an extensive battery of assessments, included clinical phenotypes, genotypes, cognitive performance, biological markers, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We enrolled 116 DRPLA patients, including 96 manifest patients and 20 prodromal patients. We identified a previously unreported <i>ATN1</i> haplotype consisting of 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Cognitive assessments revealed that 51 manifest patients (96%) and 4 prodromal patients (29%) scored &lt;26 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Manifest patients showed impairments across all cognitive domains, whereas prodromal patients showed deficits only in phonemic fluency. Biological analyses showed significantly elevated plasma neurofilament light levels in manifest patients compared with prodromal patients (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and healthy controls (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed widespread gray matter loss across the whole brain in manifest patients, whereas prodromal patients showed gray matter loss localized to the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first DRPLA cohort study to comprehensively report clinical, genetic, cognitive, imaging, and plasma neurofilament light data. This study provides robust data to enhance our understanding of the overall features of DRPLA. We also propose clear definitions for the preclinical stage of DRPLA, and demonstrate the high diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light as a biomarker.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the clinical features that identify patients with suspected rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) who will develop RPD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with suspected RPD were enrolled and followed at Mayo Clinic (Jacksonville, FL; January 2020 to October 2023) and Washington University (Saint Louis, MO; June 2016 to December 2019). Two dementia specialists independently reviewed clinical data and assigned diagnoses. Patients were diagnosed with RPD if they developed dementia within 1 year or incapacitation within 2 years of symptom onset. The associations between clinical features and causes and outcomes were explored via univariate and multivariate comparisons.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 248 patients with suspected RPD, 185 (74.6%) met criteria for RPD. Patients with RPD were older (62.6 ± 14.5 vs 55.2 ± 18.1 years; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.40, 7.31) or Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.38, 15.75). Visual agnosia (15/183; 8.2%), substantial brain atrophy (27/182; 14.8%), and periodic epileptiform discharges (11/151; 7.3%) were exclusively detected in patients with RPD. After controlling for age, intensive care unit admission (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.61, 14.12), lack of seizures (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.15, 5.31), abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (OR 2.01, 95% CI 0.997, 4.05), and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count ≤5 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.60, 6.82) were also independently associated with RPD. Patients with RPD were more likely to die or develop severe dementia (mean time to outcome, 36.1 months; 95% CI 31.2–41.0).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Selected clinical features may identify patients with suspected RPD who are likely to continue to decline. Early recognition of these features may improve diagnostic accuracy and inform prognosis. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:764–776</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spinal cord (SC) atrophy correlates with and predicts the underlying progressive biology in active and non-active multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby providing a biomarker for clinical trials and patient management. Initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) may be followed by early pronounced central nervous system (CNS) volume loss due to resolution of inflammation (pseudoatrophy) and confounding the interpretation of atrophy. High-dose glucocorticoids (HDGs) reduce inflammation and might therefore modify pseudoatrophy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred twenty-three newly diagnosed and DMT-naïve MS participants (relapsing–remitting, 70% female participants, median age = 36 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 2.0) were followed for up to 3 years. Forty-two participants received HDG before baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; DMT-HDG; median = 52 days, interquartile range [IQR] = 37–71), whereas 60 did not (DMT/no-HDG). Twenty-one participants remained untreated (no-DMT), and 102 started DMT after baseline MRI. SC total cervical cord cross-sectional area (TCA), gray matter area (GMA), and white matter area (WMA) and regional brain volumes were analyzed using mixed effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The DMT-HDG, DMT/no-HDG, and no-DMT groups had similar demographic, clinical, and radiological features. Pronounced SC pseudoatrophy was observed based on more year 1 versus year 2 volume loss for DMT/no-HDG (−2.06% vs. 0.83%; <i>P</i> = 0.02) but not DMT-HDG (−0.51% vs. 0.66%; <i>P</i> = 0.8) and more year 1 volume loss for DMT/no-HDG compared to DMT-HDG (−2.06% vs. 0.51%; <i>P</i> = 0.02).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HDG preceding baseline MRI suppresses CNS white matter (WM) pseudoatrophy after DMT initiation, most conspicuously for the SC. Suppression of pseudoatrophy with HDG may improve the fidelity of clinical trials and enhance the feasibility for short-term trials with SC and brain MRI outcomes in active MS by pretreatment with HDG.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Biomarkers of disease pathogenesis are critically needed for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to facilitate diagnosis and patient stratification into appropriate therapeutic trials. Proteomic studies offer significant potential to advance this, but reproducibility across laboratories is a key component toward identifying protein changes that can be translated into clinical applications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A combined analysis of 25 proteomic studies in human ALS biospecimens was performed to identify proteins consistently altered in ALS postmortem tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, or blood, as well as across primary regions of ALS pathology and peripheral biofluids. We consolidated these datasets into a user-friendly database “FindMND Biomarker,” which is an accessible search tool that allows users to quickly determine how often, and in which biospecimen types, their proteins of interest are dysregulated in patients with ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our combined analysis identified 1,458 altered proteins in ALS, and revealed consistent dysregulation in mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and RNA binding proteins in primary and later affected regions of ALS pathology. Remarkable consistency in the direction and dysregulation of chitinases and gelsolin proteins were observed across ALS biofluids. Comparisons of postmortem tissue and biofluids reinforce several known protein changes, and highlighted novel proteins of interest that may drive disease pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The biospecimen type in which protein dysregulation is most consistently identified provides important insight into disease, and whether these represent potential measures of disease pathogenesis or systemic changes. By streamlining proteins by reproducibility and biospecimen type, FindMNDBiomarker is a useful resource that provides new mechanistic insights, and facilitates the prioritization of ALS-associated proteins for further validation and investigation.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an emerging risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate CHIP's association with cerebrovascular or glymphatic changes in a community-based population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study examined Chinese community cohort participants. CHIP mutations were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Intracranial arterial stenosis, silent brain infarcts, cerebral small vessel disease markers, and diffusion along the perivascular space index were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. The correlation between CHIP and neuroimaging outcomes was investigated through univariate and multivariate logistic/linear regression. The multivariate regression model was adjusted for cerebrovascular disease risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 18.2% (224 out of 1,229) participants were identified as carriers of CHIP mutations. The prevalence of CHIP generally increases with age (<i>p</i> = 0.009). After adjusting for vascular risk factors using multivariate regression, CHIP mutations were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of large magnetic resonance imaging-defined infarcts (&gt;15 mm; OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.18 to 8.43; <i>p</i> = 0.018), inversely associated with diffusion along the perivascular space (<i>β</i> = −0.02; 95% CI −0.04 to 0; <i>p</i> = 0.034), and showed a borderline association with intracranial arterial stenosis (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.30; <i>p</i> = 0.053). Notably, no statistically significant correlations were observed between CHIP and cerebral small vessel disease markers or brain atrophy measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CHIP was significantly associated with glymphatic dysfunction and large infarcts, and marginally associated with intracranial arterial stenosis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology linking CHIP to cerebral covert changes. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:826–836</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein (aSyn) within the brain is the pathologic hallmark of Lewy body diseases (LBDs), including Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) disease. Although evidence exists for aSyn “strains,” conformations with distinct biological properties, biomarkers for PD versus DLB are lacking. Here, we used monoclonal antibodies selective for two different in vitro aSyn species – termed strain A and B – to evaluate human brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using these antibodies, we characterized specific aSyn species in human specimens from neurologically normal individuals and individuals with LBD using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. We also characterized aSyn species immunoprecipitated from brain lysate or plasma with these antibodies using seed amplification assays (SAAs) and a cellular model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, levels of strain A and B aSyn species were higher in plasma from individuals with PD compared to DLB in 2 independent cohorts. Lower levels of plasma aSyn strain A species predicted a faster rate of cognitive decline in individuals with PD. Furthermore, strain A and strain B aSyn species were undetectable in CSF, and their levels in brain versus plasma did not correlate. Moreover, plasma aSyn species isolated by aSyn strain antibodies could template aSyn fibrillization, and they could seed formation of aSyn inclusions in cells.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that circulating plasma aSyn strains may impact LBD clinical presentation, particularly cognition. The enrichment of these aSyn species in plasma but not CSF also suggests a potential source outside the brain. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:682–698</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to evaluate the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in an international cohort of patients with <i>VPS16</i>-related dystonia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational study collected preoperative and postoperative demographic, clinical, stimulation, genetic, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological data of medically refractory DYT-<i>VPS16</i> patients with implanted DBS in 10 international centers. Motor symptoms and disability outcomes were assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale Motor (BFMDRS-M) and Disability (BFMDRS-D) scales. A cut-off threshold for considering response to DBS was set at 25% of BFMDRS-M improvement at the last follow-up (FU) compared to baseline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 26 participants (17 men, 65.4%). Age at dystonia onset and surgery was 17.8 ± 10.9 and 35.3 ± 14.8 years, respectively. At the last FU, 102.5 ± 57.3 months (range, 2–216), the mean BFMDRS-M improvement was 41.6 ± 37.3% (26/26 patients) and 34.8 ± 42.6% for the BFMDRS-D (23/26 patients). Most patients (19/26, 73%) were considered responders. Higher motor improvement was associated with stimulation of the ventroposterior portion of the internal globus pallidus. A significant inverse relationship was observed between improvement in BFMDRS-M at last FU, and the presence of spasticity (<i>p</i> = 0.027) and fixed skeletal deformities (<i>p</i> = 0.001) before surgery. Non-responders had a younger age at disease onset and at implantation, shorter disease duration at DBS surgery, and higher baseline BFMDRS scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DBS was an effective treatment for three-quarters of patients with pathogenic <i>VPS16</i> variants in our cohort. Mean motor improvement was most pronounced at the 1-year FU, but persisted at the last FU despite disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:711–725</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the diagnostic accuracy of metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for central nervous system (CNS) infections.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were derived from three prospective cohort studies in the Netherlands. All studies included adults suspected of a CNS infection who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Metabolomics was performed on CSF using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry on a discovery and validation cohort. Metabolite quantification was the index test; a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis was the reference standard.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 343 episodes were included, of whom 170 (50%) had a CNS infections and 173 (50%) episodes had other diagnoses. CNS infections included bacterial meningitis in 88 (26%), viral meningoencephalitis in 50 (15%), and other CNS infections in 32 (9%) episodes. Other diagnoses consisted of CNS autoimmune disorders in 21 (6%), other neurological diseases in 84 (24%), and systemic infections in 68 (20%) episodes. A distinct metabolomic profile was observed in CSF of CNS infections, particularly bacterial meningitis. Glucose, glycerate, 1.3-diphosphoglyceric acid, pyruvate, lactate, taurine, and alpha-ketoglutarate had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve 0.87 to 0.95). Combinations further improved diagnostic accuracy, resulting in models that outperformed both individual metabolites and CSF leukocytes. Episodes with CSF leukocytes between 5 and 1,000 cells per mm<sup>3</sup> showed similar results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CSF metabolites demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for CNS infections, particularly bacterial meningitis. Combinations further improve the diagnostic performance, exceeding that of CSF leukocytes alone. These findings highlight the potential of cerebrospinal fluid metabolites to improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:851–863</p>

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mouse models of genetic dystonias have demonstrated abnormal striatal cholinergic interneuron excitability, but do not consistently demonstrate subjective dystonic features. To determine whether striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation can cause potentially dystonic motor behaviors, we first determined features correlated specifically with dystonia severity in people and then determined whether these features emerged in mice following striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eight movement disorders experts rated dystonia severity in 193 videos of people with cerebral palsy doing a seated task. Leg adduction variability metrics, which are known to correlate with leg dystonia severity during gait, were quantified in these videos of seated tasks. Metrics significantly associated with leg dystonia severity during seated tasks in people were then quantified in mice and compared between mice who underwent chemogenetic striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation (n = 17) and mice who did not (n = 17).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Leg adduction variability correlated well with experts' leg dystonia severity scores in people. Leg adduction variability was also significantly increased in mice that underwent striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation compared to mice that did not (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). This difference was not present with acute excitation and emerged only after 14 days of ongoing excitation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that leg adduction variability correlates with leg dystonia severity in people with cerebral palsy and that chronic, but not acute, striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation can cause leg adduction variability in mice. These results support targeting striatal cholinergic interneurons for dystonia drug development and demonstrate the potential value of using quantifiable leg adduction metrics to study dystonia pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27301?af=R">The Role of Electroencephalography in Predicting Post‐Stroke Seizures and an Updated Prognostic Model (SeLECT‐EEG)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures negatively impact stroke outcomes, highlighting the need for reliable predictors of post-stroke epilepsy. Although acute symptomatic seizures are a known risk factor, most stroke survivors who develop epilepsy do not experience them. Early electroencephalography (EEG) findings may enhance risk prediction, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, aiding in patient management and counseling.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from 1,105 stroke survivors (mean age 71 years, 54% male) with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent EEG within 7 days post-stroke. Electrographic biomarkers, including epileptiform activity and regional slowing, were analyzed for their association with post-stroke epilepsy using Cox proportional hazards regression and Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard models, adjusted for differences in EEG timing and patient characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Post-stroke epilepsy developed in 119 patients (11%), whereas 233 (21%) had acute symptomatic seizures. The 5-year epilepsy risk was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30–49%) in patients with epileptiform activity versus 13% (95% CI: 9–16%) in those without. Regional slowing doubled the 5-year epilepsy risk (23%, 95% CI: 17–30% vs 11%, 95% CI: 7–16%). Epileptiform activity (subdistribution hazard ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5–3.4, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and regional slowing (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.02) were independently associated with post-stroke epilepsy. A novel prognostic model, SeLECT-EEG (concordance statistic: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71–0.80), outperformed the previous standard (SeLECT<sub>2.0</sub>; 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65–0.76, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Electrographic biomarkers improve post-stroke epilepsy prediction beyond clinical risk factors. The SeLECT-EEG model enhances early risk stratification, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, informing management strategies and patient counseling.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite its clinical heterogeneity, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is unified by early and prominent alterations in cortical excitability, increasingly recognized as contributors to disease progression. This study assessed whether the ratio between motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, reflecting upper motor neuron integrity, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, indexing lower motor neuron function, could provide an accessible marker of corticospinal excitability to stratify patients by phenotype, stage, and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter retrospective study, 743 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients from 16 tertiary centers in Italy were analyzed. The MEP:CMAP ratio, recorded from upper limb muscles, was categorized as hyperexcitable, normal, or hypoexcitable. Phenotypes included progressive muscular atrophy (or lower motor neuron), flail arm/leg, classic, bulbar, patient with predominant upper motor neuron signs (or pyramidal), and primary lateral sclerosis. Disease stage was assessed using King's staging. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox regression models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The MEP:CMAP ratio differed significantly across phenotypes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), with hyperexcitability predominating in lower motor neuron, flail, classic, and bulbar forms, and hypoexcitability in pyramidal and primary lateral sclerosis. Hypoexcitability increased in advanced King's stages (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Hyperexcitable patients had shorter survival (<i>p</i> = 0.004), including when tested within 1 year of onset (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Cox regression identified the MEP:CMAP ratio as an independent survival predictor (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.12–3.03, <i>p</i> = 0.016).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This real-world study supports the clinical value of the MEP:CMAP ratio as a scalable biomarker of cortical excitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with prognostic relevance across phenotypes and disease stages. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:801–813</p>
