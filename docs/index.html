<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction error (PE) signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from PE signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for PC in the form of PE signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here, we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex evinces prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The broadband high-frequency amplitude (HFA) was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single-trial HFA predicted deviations and correlated with poststimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of PE signals.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning has been proposed to coincide with changes in connections between brain regions. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) to map brain-wide functional connectivity (FC) in mice that were trained in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze. C57BL6 mice were investigated in a small animal MRI scanner following 2, 10, or 15 days of acquisition learning, or 5 days of reversal learning. Spatial learning coincided with progressive and changing FC between telencephalic regions that have been implemented in spatial learning (such as hippocampus, cingulate, visual, and motor cortex). Search strategy assessment demonstrated that the use of cognitively advanced spatial strategies correlated positively with extensive telencephalic connectivity, whereas non-spatial strategies correlated negatively with connectivity. FC patterns were different and more extensive after reversal learning compared with after extended acquisition learning, which could explain why reversal learning has been shown to be more sensitive to subtle functional defects.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a decrease in glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) expression, the major mechanism for glutamate removal from synapses. Coupled with an increase in glutamate release from dead and dying neurons, this causes an increase in extracellular glutamate. The ensuing glutamate excitotoxicity disproportionately damages vulnerable GABAergic parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons, resulting in a progressively worsening cortical excitatory:inhibitory imbalance due to a loss of GABAergic inhibitory tone, as evidenced by chronic post-traumatic symptoms such as epilepsy, and supported by neuropathologic findings. This loss of intracortical inhibition can be measured and followed noninvasively using long-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with mechanomyography (LI-ppTMS-MMG). Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic, is a potent stimulator of the expression of rodent GLT-1 and would presumably decrease excitotoxic damage to GABAergic interneurons. It may thus be a viable antiepileptogenic intervention. Using a rat fluid percussion injury TBI model, we utilized LI-ppTMS-MMG, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry to test whether ceftriaxone treatment preserves intracortical inhibition and cortical parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneuron function after TBI in rat motor cortex. We show that neocortical GLT-1 gene and protein expression are significantly reduced 1 week after TBI, and this transient loss is mitigated by ceftriaxone. Importantly, whereas intracortical inhibition declines progressively after TBI, 1 week of post-TBI ceftriaxone treatment attenuates the loss of inhibition compared to saline-treated controls. This finding is accompanied by significantly higher parvalbumin gene and protein expression in ceftriaxone-treated injured rats. Our results highlight prospects for ceftriaxone as an intervention after TBI to prevent cortical inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, partly by preserving GLT-1 expression.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory retrieval is thought to depend on interactions between hippocampus and cortex, but the nature of representation in these regions and their relationship remains unclear. Here, we performed an ultra-high field fMRI (7T) experiment, comprising perception, learning and retrieval sessions. We observed a fundamental difference between representations in hippocampus and high-level visual cortex during perception and retrieval. First, while object-selective posterior fusiform cortex showed consistent responses that allowed us to decode object identity across both perception and retrieval one day after learning, object decoding in hippocampus was much stronger during retrieval than perception. Second, in visual cortex but not hippocampus, there was consistency in response patterns between perception and retrieval, suggesting that substantial neural populations are shared for both perception and retrieval. Finally, the decoding in hippocampus during retrieval was not observed when retrieval was tested on the same day as learning suggesting that the retrieval process itself is not sufficient to elicit decodable object representations. Collectively, these findings suggest that while cortical representations are stable between perception and retrieval, hippocampal representations are much stronger during retrieval, implying some form of reorganization of the representations between perception and retrieval.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in molecular pathways responsible for aging and prevalent aging-related chronic diseases. However, the lack of research linking circulating levels of miRNAs to changes in the aging brain hampers clinical translation. Here, we have investigated if serum expression of brain-enriched miRNAs that have been proposed as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a) are also associated with cognitive functioning and changes of the cerebral cortex in normal elderly subjects. Results revealed that candidate miRNAs were linked to changes in cortical thickness (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, and miR-125b), cortical glucose metabolism (miR-29b, miR-125b, and miR-146a), and cognitive performance (miR-9, miR-34a, and miR-125b). While both miR-29b and miR-125b were related to aging-related structural and metabolic cortical changes, only expression levels of miR-125b were associated with patterns of glucose consumption shown by cortical regions that correlated with executive function. Together, these findings suggest that serum expression of AD-related miRNAs are biologically meaningful in aging and may play a role as biomarkers of cerebral vulnerability in late life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a major region of the adult rodent brain in which neurogenesis occurs throughout life. The EphA4 receptor, which regulates neurogenesis and boundary formation in the developing brain, is also expressed in the adult DG, but whether it regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not known. Here, we show that, in the adult mouse brain, EphA4 inhibits hippocampal precursor cell proliferation but does not affect precursor differentiation or survival. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 significantly increased hippocampal precursor proliferation <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span>, by blocking EphA4 forward signaling. EphA4 was expressed by mature hippocampal DG neurons but not neural precursor cells, and an EphA4 antagonist, EphA4-Fc, did not activate clonal cultures of precursors until they were co-cultured with non-precursor cells, indicating an indirect effect of EphA4 on the regulation of precursor activity. Supplementation with <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-serine blocked the increased precursor proliferation induced by EphA4 inhibition, whereas blocking the interaction between <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-serine and <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-methyl-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) promoted precursor activity, even at the clonal level. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EphA4 indirectly regulates adult hippocampal precursor proliferation and thus plays a role in neurogenesis via <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-serine-regulated NMDAR signaling.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metacognition, the ability to know about one’s thought process, is self-referential. Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations (β; 15–40 Hz) with increases in early β power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of β power in a low-dimensional space (β state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that β states instantiate an internal variable determining the fate of the timing network’s trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing, suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Unilateral dorsal column lesions (DCL) at the cervical spinal cord deprive the hand regions of somatosensory cortex of tactile activation. However, considerable cortical reactivation occurs over weeks to months of recovery. While most studies focused on the reactivation of primary somatosensory area 3b, here, for the first time, we address how the higher-order somatosensory cortex reactivates in the same monkeys after DCL that vary across cases in completeness, post-lesion recovery times, and types of treatments. We recorded neural responses to tactile stimulation in areas 3a, 3b, 1, secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and occasionally areas 2/5. Our analysis emphasized comparisons of the responsiveness, somatotopy, and receptive field size between areas 3b, 1, and S2/PV across DCL conditions and recovery times. The results indicate that the extents of the reactivation in higher-order somatosensory areas 1 and S2/PV closely reflect the reactivation in primary somatosensory cortex. Responses in higher-order areas S2 and PV can be stronger than those in area 3b, thus suggesting converging or alternative sources of inputs. The results also provide evidence that both primary and higher-order fields are effectively activated after long recovery times as well as after behavioral and electrocutaneous stimulation interventions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><span style="font-style: italic;">erbb4</span> is a known susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Chandelier cells (ChCs, also known as axo-axonic cells) are a distinct GABAergic interneuron subtype that exclusively target the axonal initial segment, which is the site of pyramidal neuron action potential initiation. ChCs are a source of ErbB4 expression and alterations in ChC-pyramidal neuron connectivity occur in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of schizophrenic patients and animal models of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of ErbB4 in mPFC ChCs to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remains unknown. By conditional deletion or knockdown of ErbB4 from mPFC ChCs, we demonstrated that ErbB4 deficits led to impaired ChC-pyramidal neuron connections and cognitive dysfunctions. Furthermore, the cognitive dysfunctions were normalized by L-838417, an agonist of GABA<sub>A</sub>α2 receptors enriched in the axonal initial segment. Given that cognitive dysfunctions are a core symptom of schizophrenia, our results may provide a new perspective for understanding the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub>α2 receptors may be potential pharmacological targets for its treatment.</span>

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) typically function in higher order assemblages to regulate RNA localization and translation. The Fragile X homolog FXR2P is an RBP essential for formation of Fragile X granules, which associate with axonal mRNA and ribosomes in the intact brain. Here we performed an unbiased EGFP insertional mutagenesis screen to probe for FXR2P domains important for assembly into higher order structural states in neurons. Fifteen of the 18 unique in-frame FXR2PEGFP fusions tested formed cytosolic granules. However, EGFP insertion within a 23 amino acid region of the low complexity (LC) domain induced formation of distinct FXR2PEGFP fibrils (A and B) that were found in isolation or assembled into highly ordered bundles. Type A and B complexes exhibited different developmental timelines, ultrastructure and ribosome association with ribosomes absent from bundled Type B fibrils. The formation of both fibril types was dependent on an intact RNA binding domain. We conclude that formation of these higher order FXR2P assemblages with alternative structural and compositional states in neurons requires collaboration between the LC and RNA binding domains.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/505198v1?rss=1">Motor skill learning leads to the increase of planning horizon</a></h4>

We investigated motor skill learning using a path tracking task, where human subjects had to track various curved paths at a constant speed while maintaining the cursor within the path width. Subjects' accuracy increased with practice, even when tracking novel untrained paths. Using a "searchlight" paradigm, where only a short segment of the path ahead of the cursor was shown, we found that subjects with a higher tracking skill took a longer section of the future path into account when performing the task. An optimal control model with a fixed horizon (receding horizon control) that increases with tracking skill quantitatively captured the subjects' movement behaviour. These findings demonstrate that human subjects increase their planning horizon when acquiring a motor skill.

Intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is key in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Published studies suggest that this process begins in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and propagates into the brain decades before clinical diagnosis of PD. The triggers and mechanisms underlying the accumulation of aSyn remain unknown but evidence is growing, that immune pathways and in particular colitis may play a critical role. Here we demonstrate that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit aSyn accumulation in their colon. We then confirmed in an experimental model of IBD that intestinal inflammation can trigger aSyn accumulation in the ENS of wildtype and aSyn transgenic mice. We discovered that the type and degree of inflammation modulates the extent of aSyn accumulation in the colon and that macrophage-related signaling limits this process. Remarkably, experimental colitis at three months of age exacerbated the accumulation of aggregated phospho-Serine 129 aSyn in the midbrain, including the substantia nigra, in 21-month but not 9-month-old aSyn transgenic mice. This was accompanied by loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons, another neuropathological hallmark of PD. Together, our data suggest a critical role for intestinal inflammation in the initiation and progression of PD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/505024v1?rss=1">Quantum energy levels of glutamate modulate neural biophotonic signals</a></h4>

Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it plays an essential and important role in neural functions. Hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway and the changes in the glutamate-glutamine cycle function are important neuropathological mechanisms of severe mental disorders including schizophrenia and depression. Current studies have shown that glutamate can induce neural biophotonic activity and transmission, which may involve the mechanism of photon quantum brain; however, it is unclear whether such a mechanism follows the principle of quantum mechanics. Here we show that the action of glutamate on its receptors leads to a decrease in its quantum energy levels, and glutamate then partially or completely loses its function to further induce the biophotonic activity in mouse brain slices. The reduced quantum energy levels of glutamate can be restored by direct-current electrical discharges and the use of energy transfer of chloroplast photosynthesis; hence, the quantum energy recovered glutamate can again induce significant biophotonic activity. Furthermore, the changes in quantum energy levels of glutamate are related to the exchange and transfer of electron energy on its active hydrogen atom. These findings suggest that the glutamate-induced neural biophotonic signals may be involved in the transfer of the quantum energy levels of glutamate, which implies a quantum mechanism of neurotransmitter action. The process of glutamate recycling that is related to the synergism of neurons and glial cells and certain key enzymes may be necessary for the recovery of quantum energy levels of glutamate after completion of the neural signal transmission. These findings may also provide a new idea to develop quantum drugs.

Abstract<p>Menthol contributes to poor cessation rates among smokers, in part because menthol enhances nicotine reward and reinforcement. Mentholated tobacco products contain (–)-menthol and (+)-menthol, in varying proportions. We examined these two menthol stereoisomers for their ability to upregulate α4β2 nAChRs and to alter dopamine neuron firing frequency using long-term, low-dose (≤ 500 nM) exposure that is pharmacologically relevant to smoking. We found that (–)-menthol upregulates α4β2 nAChRs while (+)-menthol does not. We also found that (–)-menthol decreases dopamine neuron baseline firing and dopamine neuron excitability, while (+)-menthol exhibits no effect. We then examined both stereoisomers for their ability to inhibit α4β2 nAChR function at higher concentrations (&gt;10 µM) using the <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte expression system. To probe for the potential binding site of menthol, we conducted flooding simulations and site-directed mutagenesis. We found that menthol likely binds to the 9’ position on the TM2 helix. We found that menthol inhibition is dependent on the end-to-end distance of the side chain at the 9’ residue. Additionally, we have found that (–)-menthol is only modestly (~25%) more potent than (+)-menthol at inhibiting wildtype α4β2 nAChRs and a series of L9’ mutant nAChRs. These data reveal that menthol exhibits a stereoselective effect on nAChRs and that the stereochemical effect is much greater for long-term, sub µM exposure in mice than for acute, higher level exposure. We hypothesize that of the two menthol stereoisomers, only (–)-menthol plays a role in enhancing nicotine reward through nAChRs on dopamine neurons.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Menthol is the most popular flavor used in all forms of tobacco products. Depending on the method used to produce the menthol, these products contain two stereoisomers ((–)-menthol and (+)-menthol) in unregulated and poorly characterized amounts. We studied how these isomers of menthol differ in their ability to alter nicotinic receptors on dopamine neurons that contribute to tobacco addiction. Long-term treatment with (–)-menthol and (+)-menthol resulted in a stereospecific effect on nicotinic receptor upregulation and dopamine neuron excitability: (+)-menthol exhibited no effect while (–)-menthol exhibited a robust effect. In acute treatments, we found only slight differences between effects of the two isomers on nicotine receptors.

Abstract<p>Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is utilized to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity <i>in vivo</i>. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP) and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Electrophysiological recordings, with varying degrees of invasiveness, are the traditional method for measuring neural activity, possessing the capability to measure both individual neurons and populations of neurons. Imaging methods, such as computed tomography scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging, have been developed to accomplish less invasive characterization of neuronal activity; traditionally offering good spatial or relatively high temporal resolution, yet resolution of individual neurons cannot be achieved. Two-photon imaging enables network-wide analysis with cellular resolution on a faster timescale with high spatial fidelity. This study presents a method for the combination of two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings with highly transparent arrays of organic electrodes, presenting a powerful tool to simultaneously acquire the electrical and optical activity of neural circuits.</p>

<p>In this study, we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lie outside the thalamus. Ann Neurol 2018;84:926–930</p>

<p>Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using 2‐way analysis of variance with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in milliseconds, VS: 152.7 ± 7.9 vs M: 145.3 ± 9.8 vs C: 145.5 ± 9.4; <i>F</i> = 3.28; <i>p</i> = 0.046) and reduced N75–P100 amplitudes (in microvolts, VS: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs M: 12.5 ± 4.7 vs C: 10.8 ± 3.4; <i>F</i> = 3.16; <i>p</i> = 0.051). Dunnett post hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex. Ann Neurol 2018;84:946–949</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a neural and renal disorder, characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and early onset nephrotic syndrome. Biallelic mutations in <i>WDR73</i> and the 4 subunit genes of the KEOPS complex are reported to cause GAMOS. Furthermore, an identical homozygous <i>NUP107</i> (nucleoporin 107kDa) mutation was identified in 4 GAMOS‐like families, although biallelic <i>NUP107</i> mutations were originally identified in steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome. NUP107 and NUP133 (nucleoporin 133kDa) are interacting subunits of the nuclear pore complex in the nuclear envelope during interphase, and these proteins are also involved in centrosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in a previously reported GAMOS family with brain atrophy and steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a homozygous <i>NUP133</i> mutation, c.3335‐11T&gt;A, which results in the insertion of 9bp of intronic sequence between exons 25 and 26 in the mutant transcript. NUP133 and NUP107 interaction was impaired by the <i>NUP133</i> mutation based on an immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia type IIa was recognized in the brain of an autopsied patient and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed in the kidneys of the 3 examined patients. A <i>nup133</i>‐knockdown zebrafish model exhibited microcephaly, fewer neuronal cells, underdeveloped glomeruli, and fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes, which mimicked human GAMOS features. <i>nup133</i> morphants could be rescued by human wild‐type <i>NUP133</i> mRNA but not by mutant mRNA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data indicate that the biallelic <i>NUP133</i> loss‐of‐function mutation causes GAMOS. Ann Neurol 2018;84:814–828</p>

We identified an exonic polymorphism in <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; <i>p</i> = 2.2E‐8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.07) and variants in an intron of <i>COL4A1</i> (rs9521634; <i>p</i> = 3.8E‐8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06) and near <i>DYRK1A</i> (rs720470; <i>p</i> = 6.1E‐9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.07) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

<p>A professional violinist reported increasing difficulties playing the violin. He executed the initial half of the musical piece well, but produced an increasing number of mistakes during the second half. Neurological examination was remarkable for bradykinesia and tremor. Formal acoustic analysis of finger taps and pronation‐supination showed a decrement in sound intensity and number of taps over time. Oscillations in performance correlated with a parkinsonian tremor. We interpret these findings as the audible equivalent of bradykinesia and tremor. Listening to bradykinesia and quantifying its decrement using acoustic analysis may offer a simple, objective, and reliable supplement to the neurological examination. Ann Neurol 2018;84:931–933.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. We validated the role of <i>COLGALT1</i> variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in <i>COLGALT1</i> encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant <i>COLGALT1</i> insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.026, η<i>p</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.030, η<i>p</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.614, <i>d</i> = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.023, <i>d</i> = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.030, <i>d</i> = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus. Ann Neurol 2018;84:886–892</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cortical gray matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration, and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology at early stages of MS to better predict long‐term outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n = 12, median disease duration = 2 years), progressive MS (n = 21, disease duration = 25 years), non‐diseased controls (n = 11), and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n = 6) were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range = 1–48% of total cortical GM), and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68<sup>+</sup>) microglia/macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions, and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‐like structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/macrophage activation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‐like structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss, and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome. Ann Neurol 2018;84:829–842</p>

<p>Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson disease. Pathogenic mechanisms include phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, nonphysiological levodopa‐to‐dopamine conversion in serotonergic neurons, hyperactivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, and overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine‐releasing axons. Delay in initiating levodopa is no longer recommended, as dyskinesia development is a function of disease duration rather than cumulative levodopa exposure. We review current and in‐development treatments for peak‐dose dyskinesia but suggest that improvements in levodopa delivery alone may reduce its future prevalence. Ann Neurol 2018;84:797–811</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traditionally, angiographic vasospasm (aVS) has been thought to cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, successful treatment of aVS alone does not result in improved neurological outcome. Therefore, there may be other potential causes of poor neurological outcome, including spreading depolarization (SD). A recent study showed beneficial effects of cilostazol on DCI and neurological outcome. The present prospective clinical trial and experimental study focused on effects of cilostazol on SDs.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty aSAH patients were treated with clip ligation and randomly assigned to a cilostazol (n = 23) or control group (n = 27). Effects of cilostazol on DCI, aVS, and SDs, measured with subdural electrodes, were examined. The effect of cilostazol on SD‐induced perfusion deficits (spreading ischemia) was assessed in an aSAH‐mimicking model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a trend for less DCI in the cilostazol group, but it did not reach our threshold for statistical significance (13.0% vs 40.0%, odds ratio = 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.059–1.192, <i>p</i> = 0.084). However, the total SD‐induced depression duration per recording day (22.2 vs 30.2 minutes, β = −251.905, 95% CI = −488.458 to −15.356, <i>p</i> = 0.043) and the occurrence of isoelectric SDs (0 vs 4 patients, β = −0.916, 95% CI = −1.746 to −0.085, <i>p</i> = 0.037) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. In rats, cilostazol significantly shortened SD‐induced spreading ischemia compared to vehicle (Student <i>t</i> test, difference = 30.2, 95% CI = 5.3–55.1, <i>p</i> = 0.020).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Repair of the neurovascular response to SDs by cilostazol, as demonstrated in the aSAH‐mimicking model, may be a promising therapy to control DCI. Ann Neurol 2018;84:873–885</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The spectrum of clinical symptom changes during the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa therapy, while offering remarkable control of classical motor symptoms, causes abnormal involuntary movements as the disease progresses. This levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity. Because slow wave activity (SWA) of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep underlies adjustment of cortical excitability, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this physiological process and LID.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty‐six patients at different stages of PD underwent whole‐night video polysomnography–high‐density electroencephalography (vPSG‐hdEEG), preceded by 1 week of actigraphy. To represent the broad spectrum of the disease, patients were divided into 3 groups by disease stage—(1) de novo (n = 9), (2) advanced (n = 13), and (3) dyskinetic (DYS; n = 14)—were compared to an age‐matched control group (n = 12). The SWA‐NREM content of the vPSG‐hdEEG was then temporally divided into 10 equal parts, from T1 to T10, and power and source analyses were performed. T2‐T3‐T4 were considered early sleep and were compared to T7‐T8‐T9, representing late sleep.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that all groups, except the DYS group, manifested a clear‐cut SWA decrease between early and late sleep.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data demonstrate a strong pathophysiological association between sleep and PD. Given that SWA may be a surrogate for synaptic strength, our data suggest that DYS patients do not have adequate synaptic downscaling. Further analysis is needed to determine the effect of drugs that can enhance cortical SWA in LID. Ann Neurol 2018;84:905–917</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically approved thiol‐containing redox modulatory compound currently in trials for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although generically labeled as an “antioxidant,” poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5‐lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral‐gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NAC prevented hemin‐induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate‐dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione‐dependent enzymes such as glutathione <i>S</i>‐transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular lipid peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic arachidonic acid products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE<sub>2</sub> in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the mitochondrial protein frataxin, is characterized by ataxia and gait instability, immobility, and eventual death. We evaluated corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) quantification of corneal nerve morphology as a novel, noninvasive, in vivo quantitative imaging biomarker for the severity of neurological manifestations in FRDA.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Corneal nerve fiber density, branch density, and fiber length were quantified in individuals with FRDA (n = 23) and healthy age‐matched controls (n = 14). All individuals underwent genetic testing and a detailed neurological assessment with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS). A subset of individuals with FRDA who were ambulatory underwent quantitative gait assessment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CCM demonstrated a significant reduction in nerve fiber density and length in FRDA compared to healthy controls. Importantly, CCM parameters correlated with genotype, SARA and FARS neurological scales, and linear regression modeling of CCM nerve parameter–generated equations that predict the neurologic severity of FRDA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together, the data suggest that CCM quantification of corneal nerve morphology is a rapid, sensitive imaging biomarker for quantifying the severity of neurologic disease in individuals with FRDA. Ann Neurol 2018;84:893–904</p>

<p>Researchers traditionally solve the computational problems through rigorous
and deterministic algorithms called as Hard Computing. These precise algorithms
have widely been realized using digital technology as an inherently reliable
and accurate implementation platform, either in hardware or software forms.
This rigid form of implementation which we refer as Hard Realization relies on
strict algorithmic accuracy constraints dictated to digital design engineers.
Hard realization admits paying as much as necessary implementation costs to
preserve computation precision and determinism throughout all the design and
implementation steps. Despite its prior accomplishments, this conventional
paradigm has encountered serious challenges with today's emerging applications
and implementation technologies. Unlike traditional hard computing, the
emerging soft and bio-inspired algorithms do not rely on fully precise and
deterministic computation. Moreover, the incoming nanotechnologies face
increasing reliability issues that prevent them from being efficiently
exploited in hard realization of applications. This article examines Soft
Realization, a novel bio-inspired approach to design and implementation of an
important category of applications noticing the internal brain structure. The
proposed paradigm mitigates major weaknesses of hard realization by (1)
alleviating incompatibilities with today's soft and bio-inspired algorithms
such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and human sense signal
processing applications, and (2) resolving the destructive inconsistency with
unreliable nanotechnologies. Our experimental results on a set of well-known
soft applications implemented using the proposed soft realization paradigm in
both reliable and unreliable technologies indicate that significant energy,
delay, and area savings can be obtained compared to the conventional
implementation.

<p>A model of incentive salience as a function of stimulus value and
interoceptive state has been previously proposed. In that model, the function
differs depending on whether the stimulus is appetitive or aversive; it is
multiplicative for appetitive stimuli and additive for aversive stimuli. The
authors argued it was necessary to capture data on how extreme changes in salt
appetite could move evaluation of an extreme salt solution from negative to
positive. We demonstrate that arbitrarily varying this function is unnecessary,
and that a multiplicative function is sufficient if one assumes the incentive
salience function for an incentive (such as salt) is comprised of multiple
stimulus features and multiple interoceptive signals. We show that it is also
unnecessary considering the dual-structure approach-aversive nature of the
reward system, which results in separate weighting of appetitive and aversive
stimulus features.

<p>Here I introduce an extension to demixed principal component analysis (dPCA),
a linear dimensionality reduction technique for analyzing the activity of
neural populations, to the case of nonlinear dimensions. This is accomplished
using kernel methods, resulting in kernel demixed principal component analysis
(kdPCA). This extension resembles kernel-based extensions to standard principal
component analysis and canonical correlation analysis. kdPCA includes dPCA as a
special case when the kernel is linear. I present examples of simulated neural
activity that follows different low dimensional configurations and compare the
results of kdPCA to dPCA. These simulations demonstrate that nonlinear
interactions can impede the ability of dPCA to demix neural activity
corresponding to experimental parameters, but kdPCA can still recover
interpretable components. Additionally, I compare kdPCA and dPCA to a neural
population from rat orbitofrontal cortex during an odor classification task in
recovering decision-related activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43320">Cooperative cobinding of synthetic and natural ligands to the nuclear receptor PPARγ</a></h4>

Crystal structures of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) have revealed overlapping binding modes for synthetic and natural/endogenous ligands, indicating competition for the orthosteric pocket. Here we show that cobinding of a synthetic ligand to the orthosteric pocket can push natural and endogenous PPARγ ligands (fatty acids) out of the orthosteric pocket towards an alternate ligand-binding site near the functionally important omega (Ω) loop. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis coupled to quantitative biochemical functional and cellular assays reveal that synthetic ligand and fatty acid cobinding can form a 'ligand link' to the Ω loop and synergistically affect the structure and function of PPARγ. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating ligand binding to nuclear receptors can be more complex than the classical one-for-one orthosteric exchange of a natural or endogenous ligand with a synthetic ligand.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41841">Developmental 'awakening' of primary motor cortex to the sensory consequences of movement</a></h4>

Before primary motor cortex (M1) develops its motor functions, it functions like a somatosensory area. Here, by recording from neurons in the forelimb representation of M1 in postnatal day (P) 8-12 rats, we demonstrate a rapid shift in its sensory responses. At P8-10, M1 neurons respond overwhelmingly to feedback from sleep-related twitches of the forelimb, but the same neurons do not respond to wake-related movements. By P12, M1 neurons suddenly respond to wake movements, a transition that results from opening the sensory gate in the external cuneate nucleus. Also at P12, fewer M1 neurons respond to individual twitches, but the full complement of twitch-related feedback observed at P8 is unmasked through local disinhibition. Finally, through P12, M1 sensory responses originate in the deep thalamorecipient layers, not primary somatosensory cortex. These findings demonstrate that M1 initially establishes a sensory framework upon which its later-emerging role in motor control is built.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39569">Temporally specific engagement of distinct neuronal circuits regulating olfactory habituation in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Habituation is the process that enables salience filtering, precipitating perceptual changes that alter the value of environmental stimuli. To discern the neuronal circuits underlying habituation to brief inconsequential stimuli, we developed a novel olfactory habituation paradigm, identifying two distinct phases of the response that engage distinct neuronal circuits. Responsiveness to the continuous odor stimulus is maintained initially, a phase we term habituation latency and requires Rutabaga Adenylyl-Cyclase-depended neurotransmission from GABAergic Antennal Lobe Interneurons and activation of excitatory Projection Neurons (PNs) and the Mushroom Bodies. In contrast, habituation depends on the inhibitory PNs of the middle Antenno-Cerebral Track, requires inner Antenno-Cerebral Track PN activation and defines a temporally distinct phase. Collectively, our data support the involvement of Lateral Horn excitatory and inhibitory stimulation in habituation. These results provide essential cellular substrates for future analyses of the molecular mechanisms that govern the duration and transition between these distinct temporal habituation phases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39061">Specific lexico-semantic predictions are associated with unique spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity</a></h4>

We used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with Representational Similarity Analysis to probe neural activity associated with distinct, item-specific lexico-semantic predictions during language comprehension. MEG activity was measured as participants read highly constraining sentences in which the final words could be predicted. Before the onset of the predicted words, both the spatial and temporal patterns of brain activity were more similar when the same words were predicted than when different words were predicted. The temporal patterns localized to the left inferior and medial temporal lobe. These findings provide evidence that unique spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity are associated with item-specific lexico-semantic predictions. We suggest that the unique spatial patterns reflected the prediction of spatially distributed semantic features associated with the predicted word, and that the left inferior/medial temporal lobe played a role in temporally 'binding' these features, giving rise to unique lexico-semantic predictions.

A recurrent theme in viral immune evasion is the sabotage of MHC-I antigen presentation, which brings virus the concomitant issue of 'missing-self' recognition by NK cells that use inhibitory receptors to detect surface MHC-I proteins. Here we report that rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP) encodes a Qa-1 like protein (pQa-1) via RNA splicing to counteract NK activation. While pQa-1 surface expression is stabilized by the same canonical peptides presented by murine Qa-1, pQa-1 is GPI-anchored and resistant to the activity of RHVP pK3, a ubiquitin ligase that targets MHC-I for degradation. pQa-1 tetramer staining indicates that it recognizes CD94/NKG2A receptors. Consistently, pQa-1 selectively inhibits NKG2A<sup>+</sup> NK cells and expression of pQa-1 can protect tumor cells from NK control <i>in vivo</i>. Collectively these findings reveal an innovative NK evasion strategy wherein RHVP encodes a modified Qa-1 mimic refractory to MHC-I sabotage and capable of specifically engaging inhibitory receptors to circumvent NK activation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38446">NMDA spikes mediate amplification of inputs in the rat piriform cortex</a></h4>

The piriform cortex (PCx) receives direct input from the olfactory bulb (OB) and is the brain's main station for odor recognition and memory. The transformation of the odor code from OB to PCx is profound: mitral and tufted cells in olfactory glomeruli respond to individual odorant molecules, whereas pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the PCx responds to multiple, apparently random combinations of activated glomeruli. How these 'discontinuous' receptive fields are formed from OB inputs remains unknown. Counter to the prevailing view that olfactory PNs sum their inputs passively, we show for the first time that NMDA spikes within individual dendrites can both amplify OB inputs and impose combination selectivity upon them, while their ability to compartmentalize voltage signals allows different dendrites to represent different odorant combinations. Thus, the 2-layer integrative behavior of olfactory PN dendrites provides a parsimonious account for the nonlinear remapping of the odor code from bulb to cortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37513">Genome-wide quantification of the effects of DNA methylation on human gene regulation</a></h4>

Changes in DNA methylation are involved in development, disease, and the response to environmental conditions. However, not all regulatory elements are functionally methylation-dependent (MD). Here, we report a method, mSTARR-seq, that assesses the causal effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity at hundreds of thousands of fragments (millions of CpG sites) simultaneously. Using mSTARR-seq, we identify thousands of MD regulatory elements in the human genome. MD activity is partially predictable using sequence and chromatin state information, and distinct transcription factors are associated with higher activity in unmethylated versus methylated DNA. Further, pioneer TFs linked to higher activity in the methylated state appear to drive demethylation of experimentally methylated sites. MD regulatory elements also predict methylation-gene expression relationships across individuals, where they are 1.6x enriched among sites with strong negative correlations. mSTARR-seq thus provides a map of MD regulatory activity in the human genome and facilitates interpretation of differential methylation studies.

Transparent reporting is essential for the critical evaluation of studies. However, the reporting of statistical methods for studies in the biomedical sciences is often limited. This systematic review examines the quality of reporting for two statistical tests, t-tests and ANOVA, for papers published in a selection of physiology journals in June 2017. Of the 328 original research articles examined, 277 (84.5%) included an ANOVA or t-test or both. However, papers in our sample were routinely missing essential information about both types of tests: for example, 213 papers (95% of the papers that used ANOVA) did not contain the information needed to determine what type of ANOVA was performed, and 26.7% of papers did not specify what post-hoc test was performed. Most papers also omitted the information needed to verify ANOVA results. Essential information about t-tests was also missing in many papers. We conclude by discussing measures that could be taken to improve the quality of reporting.

Proper regulation of germline gene expression is essential for fertility and maintaining species integrity. In the <i>C. elegans</i> germline, a diverse repertoire of regulatory pathways promote the expression of endogenous germline genes and limit the expression of deleterious transcripts to maintain genome homeostasis. Here we show that the conserved TRIM-NHL protein, NHL-2, plays an essential role in the <i>C. elegans</i> germline, modulating germline chromatin and meiotic chromosome organization. We uncover a role for NHL-2 as a co-factor in both positively (CSR-1) and negatively (HRDE-1) acting germline 22G-small RNA pathways and the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein and, along with RNA-seq data point to a small RNA independent role for NHL-2 in regulating transcripts at the level of RNA stability. Collectively, our data implicate NHL-2 as an essential hub of gene regulatory activity in both the germline and soma.

Transforming the barrage of sensory signals into a coherent multisensory percept relies on solving the binding problem - deciding whether signals come from a common cause and should be integrated, or instead be segregated. Human observers typically arbitrate between integration and segregation consistent with Bayesian Causal Inference, but the neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We presented observers with audiovisual sequences that varied in the number of flashes and beeps. Combining Bayesian modelling and EEG representational similarity analyses, we show that the brain initially represents the number of flashes and beeps and their numeric disparity mainly independently. Later, it computes them by averaging the forced-fusion and segregation estimates weighted by the probabilities of common and independent cause models (i.e. model averaging). Crucially, prestimulus oscillatory alpha power and phase correlate with observers' prior beliefs about the world's causal structure that guide their arbitration between sensory integration and segregation.

Many neural systems display avalanche behavior characterized by uninterrupted sequences of neuronal firing whose distributions of size and durations are heavy-tailed. Theoretical models of such systems suggest that these dynamics support optimal information transmission and storage. However, the unknown role of network structure precludes an understanding of how variations in network topology manifest in neural dynamics and either support or impinge upon information processing. Here, using a generalized spiking model, we develop a mechanistic understanding of how network topology supports information processing through network dynamics. First, we show how network topology determines network dynamics by analytically and numerically demonstrating that network topology can be designed to propagate stimulus patterns for long durations. We then identify strongly connected cycles as empirically observable network motifs that are prevalent in such networks. Next, we show that within a network, mathematical intuitions from network control theory are tightly linked with dynamics initiated by node-specific stimulation and can identify stimuli that promote long-lasting cascades. Finally, we use these network-based metrics and control-based stimuli to demonstrate that long-lasting cascade dynamics facilitate delayed recovery of stimulus patterns from network activity, as measured by mutual information. Collectively, our results provide evidence that cortical networks are structured with architectural motifs that support long-lasting propagation and recovery of a few crucial patterns of stimulation, especially those consisting of activity in highly controllable neurons. Broadly, our results imply that avalanching neural networks could contribute to cognitive faculties that require persistent activation of neuronal patterns, such as working memory or attention.

Wind is a major navigational cue for insects, but how wind direction is decoded by central neurons in the insect brain is unknown. Here, we find that walking flies combine signals from both antennae to orient to wind during olfactory search behavior. Movements of single antennae are ambiguous with respect to wind direction, but the difference between left and right antennal displacements yields a linear code for wind direction in azimuth. Second-order mechanosensory neurons share the ambiguous responses of single antenna and receive input primarily from the ipsilateral antenna. Finally, we identify a novel set of neurons, which we call wedge projection neurons, that integrate signals across the two antennae and receive input from at least three classes of second-order neurons to produce a more linear representation of wind direction. This study establishes how a feature of the sensory environment-- the wind direction-- is decoded by single neurons that compare information across two sensors.

Complement activation has been implicated as an inflammatory driver of neurodegeneration in retinal and brain pathologies. However, its involvement and influence of photoreceptor degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited, largely incurable blinding disease, is unclear. We discover that markedly upregulated retinal expression of multiple complement components coincided spatiotemporally with photoreceptor degeneration in both the rd10 mouse model and in human specimens of RP, with increased complement C3 expression and activation localizing to infiltrating microglia near photoreceptors. Genetic ablation of C3 in the rd10 background resulted in accelerated structural and functional photoreceptor degeneration and altered retinal expression of inflammatory genes. These effects were phenocopied by the genetic deletion of CR3, a microglia-expressed receptor for the C3 activation product C3b, implicating an adaptive microglial-mediation mechanism involving C3-CR3 interaction. Deficiency of either C3 or CR3 resulted in deficient microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic photoreceptors in vivo, as well as increased microglial neurotoxicity to photoreceptors in vitro. These findings demonstrate a novel adaptive role for complement activation in RP that facilitates microglial clearance of apoptotic photoreceptors, without which increased proinflammatory microglial neurotoxicity ensues. These positive contributions of complement via microglial-mediated mechanisms are important in the design of immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches to neurodegeneration.

Cognitive processes are mediated by communication among multiple brain areas that individually exhibit oscillatory neuro-electromagnetic signals emerging from a cascade of complex physiological processes. Several studies have reported that aging changes the intrinsic properties of neural oscillations, both in resting state and in the context of cognitive tasks. For example, the amplitude of resting and motor-related beta band oscillations (16-25 Hz) is typically found to be higher in the older population compared to the younger population. Similarly, a substantial number of reports have highlighted that peak alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) is lowered in neurodegenerative disorders and in healthy aging. How such observations emerge from underlying neuronal signal processing mechanisms remains elusive. Furthermore, how do the spatiotemporal organization of these rhythms support the current neurobiological theories of aging is poorly understood. Here we addressed these issues using the resting state magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data from a large cross-sectional cohort consisting of 650 human participants with age range 18-90 covering the entire adult lifespan. Concurring with previous research in smaller cohorts, we found a consistent increase in the power of beta oscillations and a decrease in the peak alpha frequency as a function of age. Subsequently, we found significant posterior to anterior shifts in the spectral topographies of both alpha and beta bands. To reconcile these observations with a comprehensive theory at the level of network level signal processing, we computed the whole-brain global coherence that captures the degree of communication among nodes of a large-scale network as a function of aging. The global coherence among MEG signals increased with age in slower time-scales i.e. delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (3-7 Hz) frequencies. Simultaneously, global coherence decreased for faster timescales i.e. alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-25 Hz) frequencies. Further, using the measure of metastability that quantifies the divergence of a network from a stable synchronous state, we characterized the dispersion of information processing in different frequency bands. Putting together, our study reveals how neurobiological theories of aging such as posterior to anterior shifts of sensory and cognitive processing, dynamic workspace hypothesis can all be reconciled using resting-state MEG data. We could highlight how the temporal structure of MEG signals is representative of a more comprehensive understanding of large-scale network mechanisms that govern lifespan dynamics.

One of the most pernicious characteristics of alcohol use disorder is the compulsion to drink despite negative consequences. The insular cortex (insula) controls decision-making under conditions of risk or conflict and regulates maladaptive behaviors in the context of addiction. Cortical activity is tightly controlled by fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons that are often enclosed by specialized extracellular matrix structures known as perineuronal nets, which regulate neuronal excitability and plasticity. Using a mouse model of compulsive drinking in which alcohol was adulterated with the bitter tastant quinine, we demonstrate that disrupting perineuronal nets in the insula rendered mice more sensitive to quinine-adulterated alcohol. Activation of the insula, as measured by c-fos expression, occurred during aversion-resistant drinking and was further enhanced by elimination of perineuronal nets. These results provide fundamental insight into neuroanatomical and cellular mechanisms that control compulsive drinking.

Lifting an object requires precise scaling of fingertip forces based on a prediction of object weight. At object contact, a series of tactile and visual events arise that need to be rapidly processed online to fine-tune the planned motor commands for lifting the object. The brain mechanisms underlying multisensory integration serially at transient sensorimotor events, a general feature of actions requiring hand-object interactions, are not yet understood. Here we tested the relative weighting between haptic and visual signals when they are integrated online into the motor command. We used a new virtual reality setup to desynchronize visual feedback from haptics, which allowed us to probe the relative contribution of haptics and vision in driving participants' movements when they grasped virtual objects simulated by two force-feedback robots. We found that visual delay changed the profile of fingertip force generation and led participants to perceive objects as heavier than when lifts were performed without visual delay. We further modeled the effect of vision on motor output by manipulating the extent to which delayed visual events could bias the force profile, which allowed us to determine the specific weighting the brain assigns to haptics and vision. Our results show for the first time how visuo-haptic integration is processed at discrete sensorimotor events for controlling object lifting dynamics and further highlight the organization of multisensory signals online for controlling action and perception.

Auditory attention decoding (AAD) through a brain-computer interface has had a flowering of developments since it was first introduced by Mesgarani and Chang (2012) using electrocorticograph recordings. AAD has been pursued for its potential application to hearing-aid design in which an attention-guided algorithm selects, from multiple competing acoustic sources, which should be enhanced for the listener and which should be suppressed. Traditionally, researchers have separated the AAD problem into two stages: reconstruction of a representation of the attended audio from neural signals, followed by determining the similarity between the candidate audio streams and the reconstruction. In this work, we compare the traditional two-stage approach with a novel neural-network architecture that subsumes the explicit similarity step. We compare this new architecture against linear and non-linear (neural-network) baselines using both wet and dry electroencephalogram (EEG) systems. Our results indicate that the wet and dry systems can deliver comparable results despite the latter having one third as many EEG channels as the former, and that the new architecture outperforms the baseline stimulus-reconstruction methods for both EEG modalities. The 14-subject, wet-electrode AAD dataset for two competing, co-located talkers, the 11-subject, dry-electrode AAD dataset, and our software are available to download for further validation, experimentation, and modification.

Sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-beta petide (Abeta) release is an upstream event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The function of APP in neuronal physiology is still, however, poorly understood. Along with its paralog APP-like Proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1-2), APP is involved in neurite formation and synaptic function by mechanisms that are not elucidated. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain that resembles a cell adhesion molecule or a membrane receptor, suggesting that its function relies on cell interaction processes and/or activation of intracellular pathways of signal transduction. Along this line, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was reported to act as a transcriptional factor for targeted gene activation that mediates physiological APP functions. Here, we used an unbiased transcriptome-based approach to identify the genes transcriptionally regulated by APP in the rodent embryonic cortex and upon maturation of primary cortical neurons. The transcriptome analysis did not detect any significant differences in expression of previously proposed AICD target genes. The overall transcriptional changes were subtle, but we found that genes clustered in neuronal-activity dependent pathways are dysregulated in the absence of APP. Among these genes, we found the activity-dependent Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) Immediate Early Gene to be downregulated in the absence of APP. Down-regulation of NPAS4 in APP knock-out (KO) neurons is not related to AICD but to the APP ectodomain. We studied the effect of APP deficiency on GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission, and found an increased production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in APP KO neurons, along with a reduced expression of the GABA(A) receptors alpha1, suggesting an impaired GABAergic neurotransmission in the absence of APP. CRISPR-Cas-mediated silencing of NPAS4 in neurons led to similar observations. Altogether, our results point out a new role for APP in the regulation of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission through the regulation of the activity-dependent NPAS4 gene.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/504282v1?rss=1">PSI controls tim splicing and circadian period in Drosophila</a></h4>

The Drosophila circadian pacemaker consists of transcriptional feedback loops subjected to both post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. While post-translational regulatory mechanisms have been studied in detail, much less is known about circadian post-transcriptional control. To have a better understanding of the role and mechanisms of circadian post-transcriptional regulation, we targeted 364 RNA binding and RNA associated proteins with RNA interference. Among the 43 genes we identified was the alternative splicing regulator P-element somatic inhibitor (PSI). PSI downregulation shortens the period of circadian rhythms both in the brain and in peripheral tissues. Interestingly, we found that PSI regulates the thermosensitive alternative splicing of timeless (tim), promoting splicing events favored at warm temperature over those increased at cold temperature. Moreover, the period of circadian behavior was insensitive to PSI downregulation when flies could produce functional TIM proteins only from a transgene that cannot form the thermosensitive splicing isoforms. Therefore, we conclude that PSI regulates the period of Drosophila circadian rhythms through its modulation of the tim splicing pattern.

Bodily self-consciousness is defined as a set of prereflective representations of integrated bodily signals giving rise to self-identification, self-location and first-person perspective. While bodily self-consciousness is known to modulate perception, little is known about its influence on higher-level cognitive processes. Here, we manipulated bodily self-consciousness by applying sensorimotor conflicts while participants performed a perceptual task followed by confidence judgments. Results showed that sensorimotor conflicts altered perceptual monitoring by decreasing metacognitive performance. In a second experiment, we replicated this finding and extended our results by showing that sensorimotor conflicts also altered action monitoring, as measured implicitly through intentional binding. In a third experiment, we showed that effects on perceptual monitoring were induced specifically by sensorimotor conflicts related to the trunk and not to the hand. Taken together, our results suggest that bodily self-consciousness may serve as a scaffold for perceptual and action monitoring.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/504233v1?rss=1">Dual-color volumetric imaging of neural activity of cortical columns</a></h4>

To capture the emergent properties of neural circuits, high-speed volumetric imaging of neural activity at cellular resolution is desirable. But while conventional two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful tool to study population activity in vivo, it is restrained to two-dimensional planes. Expanding it to 3D while maintaining high spatiotemporal resolution appears necessary. Here, we developed a two-photon microscope with dual-color laser excitation that can image neural activity in a 3D volume. We imaged the neuronal activity of primary visual cortex from awake mice, spanning from L2 to L5 with 10 planes, at a rate of 10 vol/sec, and demonstrated volumetric imaging of L1 long-range PFC projections and L2/3 somatas. Using this method, we map visually-evoked neuronal ensembles in 3D, finding a lack of columnar structure in orientation responses and revealing functional correlations between cortical layers which differ from trial to trial and are missed in sequential imaging. We also reveal functional interactions between presynaptic L1 axons and postsynaptic L2/3 neurons. Volumetric two-photon imaging appears an ideal method for functional connectomics of neural circuits.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/504225v1?rss=1">Microglial activation in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like model caused by Ranbp2 lossand nucleocytoplasmic transport impairment in retinal ganglion neurons</a></h4>

Nucleocytoplasmic transport is dysregulated in sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) are purportedly involved in ALS. The Ran-binding protein 2 (Ranbp2) controls rate-limiting steps of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Mice with Ranbp2 loss in Thy1+-motoneurons develop cardinal ALS-like traits, but the impairments in RGNs and the degree of dysfunctional consonance between RGNs and motoneurons caused by Ranbp2 loss are unknown. This understanding will facilitate to discern the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport in the differential vulnerability of neurons to ALS and to develop therapeutic approaches and biomarkers in ALS. Here, we ascertain Ranbp2 function and endophenotypes in RGNs of an ALS-like mouse model lacking Ranbp2 in motoneurons and RGNs. Thy1+-RGNs lacking Ranbp2 shared with motoneurons the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. RGN abnormalities were comprised morphologically by soma hypertrophy and optic nerve axonopathy and physiologically by a delay of the visual pathway evoked potentials. Whole-transcriptome analysis showed restricted transcriptional changes in optic nerves that were distinct from those found in sciatic nerves. Specifically, the level and nucleocytoplasmic partition of the anti-apoptotic and novel substrate of Ranbp2, Pttg1/securin, were dysregulated. Further, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which modulates de novo synthesis of fatty acids and T-cell immunity, showed the highest up-regulation (35-fold). This effect was reflected by the activation of ramified Cd11b+ and CD45+-microglia, increase of F4\80+-microglia and a shift from pseudopodial/lamellipodial to amoeboidal F4\80+-microglia intermingled between RGNs of naive mice. This immunogenic phenotype was accompanied by the intracellular sequestration in RGNs of metalloproteinase-28, which regulates macrophage recruitment and polarization in inflammation. Ranbp2 genetic insults in RGNs and motoneurons trigger distinct paracrine signaling likely by the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of neural-type selective substrates. Metabolic and immune-modulators underpinning RGN-to-microglial signaling are regulated by Ranbp2, and this neuroglial system manifests endophenotypes that are likely useful in the prognosis and diagnosis of ALS.

Recent work examining astrocytic physiology centers on fluorescence imaging approaches, due to development of sensitive fluorescent indicators and observation of spatiotemporally complex calcium and glutamate activity. However, the field remains hindered in fully characterizing these dynamics, both within single cells and at the population-level, because of the insufficiency of current region-of-interest-based approaches to describe activity that is often spatially unfixed, size-varying, and propagative. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting analytical framework that releases astrocyte biologists from ROI-based tools. Astrocyte Quantitative Analysis (AQuA) software enables users to take an event-based approach to accurately capture and quantify the irregular activity observed in astrocyte imaging datasets. We apply AQuA to a range of ex vivo and in vivo imaging data, and uncover previously undescribed physiological phenomena in each. Since AQuA is data-driven and based on machine learning principles, it can be applied across model organisms, fluorescent indicators, experimental modes, and imaging resolutions and speeds, enabling researchers to elucidate fundamental astrocyte physiology.

Relying on evidence for the functional, neurochemical, and spectral parallelism between the late event-related potentials, delta oscillatory brain responses, and the skin conductance response (SCR) system the hypotheses about the existence of the SCR-related brain oscillations and their connectivity with the SCR system have been here suggested. In contrast to classical approach to event-related oscillations which relies on either stimulus- or response-locked time reference, an approach assigned as "oscillatory process-related oscillations" has been introduced. The method enables us to overcome the variability of latency period of the SCR. The hypothesis about the existence of the SCR-related brain oscillations and their delta nature has been confirmed through the grand averaging method. An unexpected finding was the complex nature of the SCR-related oscillations: in addition to the two second EEG segment which was correlated with the SCR system signals they also comprised an initial 200 ms segment uncorrelated with the SCR. The hypothesis about the connectivity between the SCR system and the respective delta brain oscillatory response has been operationalized through a multiple time series regression model. The predictor set consists of the SCR, its first three derivatives, and their mutual interactions. The Monte Carlo test of the causal link between the SCR system signals and the related delta EEG signal demonstrated significance in more than half of the participants. The findings have been considered from the standpoints of the segmental structure of the EEG, monoaminergic signaling and recently emerged the "brain-body dynamic syncytium" hypothesis.

<p>by Marius Somveille, Josh A. Firth, Lucy M. Aplin, Damien R. Farine, Ben C. Sheldon, Robin N. Thompson</p>

The social transmission of information is critical to the emergence of animal culture. Two processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads in animal populations: the movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning. We develop a model that, for the first time, explicitly integrates these processes to investigate their impacts on the spread of behavioural preferences. Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and conformity in determining whether locally-variable traditions establish across a landscape or whether a single preference dominates the whole population. The model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits <i>Parus major</i>, but also allows for a range of predictions for the emergence of animal culture under various initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias to be made. Integrating social behaviour with ecological variation will be important for understanding the stability and diversity of culture in animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hKz0zBUfxM" width="1" />

Rotors are functional reentry sources identified in clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular and atrial fibrillation. Ablation targeting rotor sites has resulted in arrhythmia termination. Recent clinical, experimental and modelling studies demonstrate that rotors are often anchored around fibrotic scars or regions with increased fibrosis. However the mechanisms leading to abundance of rotors at these locations are not clear. The current study explores the hypothesis whether fibrotic scars just serve as anchoring sites for the rotors or whether there are other active processes which drive the rotors to these fibrotic regions. Rotors were induced at different distances from fibrotic scars of various sizes and degree of fibrosis. Simulations were performed in a 2D model of human ventricular tissue and in a patient-specific model of the left ventricle of a patient with remote myocardial infarction. In both the 2D and the patient-specific model we found that without fibrotic scars, the rotors were stable at the site of their initiation. However, in the presence of a scar, rotors were eventually dynamically anchored from large distances by the fibrotic scar via a process of dynamical reorganization of the excitation pattern. This process coalesces with a change from polymorphic to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NeaY0mP8EJA" width="1" />

<p>by Vlad Elgart, Jia-Ren Lin, Joseph Loscalzo</p>

The physiochemical determinants of drug-target interactions in the microenvironment of the cell are complex and generally not defined by simple diffusion and intrinsic chemical reactivity. Non-specific interactions of drugs and macromolecules in cells are rarely considered formally in assessing pharmacodynamics. Here, we demonstrate that non-specific interactions lead to very slow incorporation kinetics of DNA binding drugs. We observe a rate of drug incorporation in cell nuclei three orders of magnitude slower than <i>in vitro</i> due to anomalous drug diffusion within cells. This slow diffusion, however, has an advantageous consequence: it leads to virtually irreversible binding of the drug to specific DNA targets in cells. We show that non-specific interactions drive slow drug diffusion manifesting as slow reaction front propagation. We study the effect of non-specific interactions in different cellular compartments by permeabilization of plasma and nuclear membranes in order to pinpoint differential compartment effects on variability in intracellular drug kinetics. These results provide the basis for a comprehensive model of the determinants of intracellular diffusion of small-molecule drugs, their target-seeking trajectories, and the consequences of these processes on the apparent kinetics of drug-target interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H3aSE1U5f0Q" width="1" />

Population-wide fluctuations of neural population activity are widely observed in cortical recordings. Huang et al. show that turbulent dynamics in spatially ordered recurrent networks give rise to low-dimensional shared variability, which can be suppressed by depolarizing inhibitory neurons.

Koolschijn et al. reveal two distinct mechanisms that protect overlapping memories from interference in the human brain. One involves separating memories in the hippocampus. The other involves neocortical inhibition, which protects against memory interference unless GABA is reduced using brain stimulation.

Abstract
<p>Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc shows distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-&gt;NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50–12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA-&gt;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4- to 7-s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-&gt;NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-&gt;NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.</p>

<p>IntroductionThe free and cued selective reminding test is used to identify
memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment and demented patients. It allows
assessing three processes: encoding, storage, and recollection of verbal
episodic memory.MethodsWe investigated the neural correlates of these three
memory processes in a large cohort study. The Memento cohort enrolled 2323
outpatients presenting either with subjective cognitive decline or mild
cognitive impairment who underwent cognitive, structural MRI and, for a subset,
fluorodeoxyglucose--positron emission tomography evaluations.ResultsEncoding
was associated with a network including parietal and temporal cortices; storage
was mainly associated with entorhinal and parahippocampal regions, bilaterally;
retrieval was associated with a widespread network encompassing frontal
regions.DiscussionThe neural correlates of episodic memory processes can be
assessed in large and standardized cohorts of patients at risk for Alzheimer's
disease. Their relation to pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease
remains to be studied.

<p>Building on the model proposed in Lillicrap et. al. we show that deep
networks can be trained using biologically plausible Hebbian rules yielding
similar performance to ordinary back-propagation. To overcome the unrealistic
symmetry in connections between layers, implicit in back-propagation, the
feedback weights are separate from the feedforward weights. But, in contrast to
Lillicrap et. al., they are also updated with a local rule - a weight is
updated solely based on the activity of the units it connects. With fixed
feedback weights the performance degrades quickly as the depth of the network
increases, when they are updated the performance is comparable to regular
back-propagation. We also propose a cost function whose derivative can be
represented as a local update rule on the last layer. Convolutional layers are
updated with tied weights across space, which is not biologically plausible. We
show that similar performance is achieved with sparse layers corresponding to
the connectivity implied by the convolutional layers, but where weights are
untied and updated separately. In the linear case we show theoretically that
the convergence of the error to zero is accelerated by the update of the
feedback weights.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07697">Training on the test set? An analysis of Spampinato et al. [arXiv:1609.00344]. (arXiv:1812.07697v1 [cs.CV])</a></h4>

<p>A recent paper [<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00344">arXiv:1609.00344</a>] claims to classify brain processing evoked
in subjects watching ImageNet stimuli as measured with EEG and to use a
representation derived from this processing to create a novel object
classifier. That paper, together with a series of subsequent papers [8, 15, 17,
20, 21, 30, 35], claims to revolutionize the field by achieving extremely
successful results on several computer-vision tasks, including object
classification, transfer learning, and generation of images depicting human
perception and thought using brain-derived representations measured through
EEG. Our novel experiments and analyses demonstrate that their results
crucially depend on the block design that they use, where all stimuli of a
given class are presented together, and fail with a rapid-event design, where
stimuli of different classes are randomly intermixed. The block design leads to
classification of arbitrary brain states based on block-level temporal
correlations that tend to exist in all EEG data, rather than stimulus-related
activity. Because every trial in their test sets comes from the same block as
many trials in the corresponding training sets, their block design thus leads
to surreptitiously training on the test set. This invalidates all subsequent
analyses performed on this data in multiple published papers and calls into
question all of the purported results. We further show that a novel object
classifier constructed with a random codebook performs as well as or better
than a novel object classifier constructed with the representation extracted
from EEG data, suggesting that the performance of their classifier constructed
with a representation extracted from EEG data does not benefit at all from the
brain-derived representation. Our results calibrate the underlying difficulty
of the tasks involved and caution against sensational and overly optimistic,
but false, claims to the contrary.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41208">A re-inducible gap gene cascade patterns the anterior-posterior axis of insects in a threshold-free fashion</a></h4>

Gap genes mediate the division of the anterior-posterior axis of insects into different fates through regulating downstream hox genes. Decades of tinkering the segmentation gene network of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> led to the conclusion that gap genes are regulated (at least initially) through a threshold-based mechanism, guided by both anteriorly- and posteriorly-localized morphogen gradients. In this paper, we show that the response of the gap gene network in the beetle <i>Tribolium</i> <i>castaneum</i> upon perturbation is consistent with a threshold-free 'Speed Regulation' mechanism, in which the speed of a genetic cascade of gap genes is regulated by a posterior morphogen gradient. We show this by re-inducing the leading gap gene (namely, <i>hunchback</i>) resulting in the re-induction of the gap gene cascade at arbitrary points in time. This demonstrates that the gap gene network is self-regulatory and is primarily under the control of a posterior regulator in <i>Tribolium</i> and possibly other short/intermediate-germ insects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40618">Measuring cis-regulatory energetics in living cells using allelic manifolds</a></h4>

Gene expression in all organisms is controlled by cooperative interactions between DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs), but quantitatively measuring TF-DNA and TF-TF interactions remains difficult. Here we introduce a strategy for precisely measuring the Gibbs free energy of such interactions in living cells. This strategy centers on the measurement and modeling of ‘allelic manifolds’, a multidimensional generalization of the classical genetics concept of allelic series. Allelic manifolds are measured using reporter assays performed on strategically designed cis-regulatory sequences. Quantitative biophysical models are then fit to the resulting data. We used this strategy to study regulation by two <i>Escherichia coli</i> TFs, CRP and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mi>σ</mi><mn>70</mn></msup></math> RNA polymerase. Doing so, we consistently obtained energetic measurements precise to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi></mi><mo>∼</mo><mn>0.1</mn></mrow></math> kcal/mol. We also obtained multiple results that deviate from the prior literature. Our strategy is compatible with massively parallel reporter assays in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and should therefore be highly scalable and broadly applicable.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38242">'Artiphysiology' reveals V4-like shape tuning in a deep network trained for image classification</a></h4>

Deep networks provide a potentially rich interconnection between neuroscientific and artificial approaches to understanding visual intelligence, but the relationship between artificial and neural representations of complex visual form has not been elucidated at the level of single-unit selectivity. Taking the approach of an electrophysiologist to characterizing single CNN units, we found many units exhibit translation-invariant boundary curvature selectivity approaching that of exemplar neurons in the primate mid-level visual area V4. For some V4-like units, particularly in middle layers, the natural images that drove them best were qualitatively consistent with selectivity for object boundaries. Our results identify a novel image-computable model for V4 boundary curvature selectivity and suggest that such a representation may begin to emerge within an artificial network trained for image categorization, even though boundary information was not provided during training. This raises the possibility that single-unit selectivity in CNNs will become a guide for understanding sensory cortex.

Abstract<p>While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 (PKA<sub>cat</sub>(pT197)), a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This study delineates a novel molecular mechanism by which PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and valosin-containing protein (VCP) interact to promote dendritic arborization.</p>

Abstract<p>A multi-electrode system that can address widely-separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive: a novel multi-site, multi-region microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and non-parallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely-spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube-cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and non-parallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long Evans rats to observe simultaneous single- and multi- unit activity from multiple widely-separated sleep-wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The novel design of the systemDrive overcomes current microdrive limitations by providing the ability to finely position microwires through multiple widely-distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and non-parallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. This allows for targeting of a larger set of brain regions, including deep brainstem areas, as the electrodes do not emerge from a single area, initial driving points can be placed at set distances from targets, and electrodes can be placed along trajectories designed to minimize collateral damage to sensitive brain structures. This technology enables easier simultaneous monitoring and analysis of neural activity in multiple widely-spaced brain regions that comprise a fully interconnected neural circuit.</p>

<p>We evaluated the cognitive status of visually impaired patients referred to
low vision rehabilitation (LVR) based on a standard cognitive battery and a new
evaluation tool, named the COGEVIS, which can be used to assess patients with
severe visual deficits. We studied patients aged 60 and above, referred to the
LVR Hospital in Paris. Neurological and cognitive evaluations were performed in
an expert memory center. Thirty-eight individuals, 17 women and 21 men with a
mean age of 70.3 $\pm$ 1.3 years and a mean visual acuity of 0.12 $\pm$ 0.02,
were recruited over a one-year period. Sixty-three percent of participants had
normal cognitive status. Cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 37.5% of
participants. The COGEVIS score cutoff point to screen for cognitive impairment
was 24 (maximum score of 30) with a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of
95%. Evaluation following 4 months of visual rehabilitation showed an
improvement of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (p = 0 004), National
Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (p = 0 035), and
Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale (p = 0 037). This study
introduces a new short test to screen for cognitive impairment in visually
impaired patients.

<p>Music has been shown to enhance motor control in patients with Parkinson's
disease (PD). Notably, musical rhythm is perceived as an external auditory cue
that helps PD patients to better control movements. The rationale of such
effects is that motor control based on auditory guidance would activate a
compensatory brain network that minimizes the recruitment of the defective
pathway involving the basal ganglia. Would associating music to movement
improve its perception and control in PD? Musical sonification consists in
modifying in real-time the playback of a preselected music according to some
movement parameters. The validation of such a method is underway for
handwriting in PD patients. When confirmed, this study will strengthen the
clinical interest of musical sonification in motor control and (re)learning in
PD.

<p>In physics, biology and engineering, network systems abound. How does the
connectivity of a network system combine with the behavior of its individual
components to determine its collective function? We approach this question for
networks with linear time-invariant dynamics by relating internal network
feedbacks to the statistical prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of
surprisingly simple and local statistics of connectivity. This results in a
reduced order model of the network input-output dynamics in terms of motifs
structures. As an example, the new formulation dramatically simplifies the
classic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the overall network behavior to one
proportional feedback wrapped around the dynamics of a single node. For general
networks, higher-order motifs systematically provide further layers and types
of feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local connectivity
shapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole, and we show
how this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as extending the time
constant with which networks remember past signals. The theory also extends to
networks composed from heterogeneous nodes with distinct dynamics and
connectivity, and patterned input to (and readout from) subsets of nodes. These
statistical descriptions provide a powerful theoretical framework to understand
the functionality of real-world network systems, as we illustrate with examples
including the mouse brain connectome.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42383">Evoked transients of pH-sensitive fluorescent false neurotransmitter reveal dopamine hot spots in the globus pallidus</a></h4>

Dopamine neurotransmission is suspected to play important physiological roles in multiple sparsely innervated brain nuclei, but there has not been a means to measure synaptic dopamine release in such regions. The globus pallidus externa (GPe) is a major locus in the basal ganglia that displays a sparse innervation of <i>en passant</i> dopamine axonal fibers. Due to the low levels of innervation that preclude electrochemical analysis, it is unknown if these axons engage in neurotransmission. To address this, we introduce an optical approach using a pH-sensitive fluorescent false neurotransmitter, FFN102, that exhibits increased fluorescence upon exocytosis from the acidic synaptic vesicle to the neutral extracellular milieu. In marked contrast to the striatum, FFN102 transients in the mouse GPe were spatially heterogeneous, smaller than in striatum with the exception of sparse hot spots, and significantly enhanced by high frequency stimulation. Our results support hot spots of dopamine release from substantia nigra axons.

Titin, the largest protein known, forms an elastic myofilament in the striated muscle sarcomere. To establish titin’s contribution to skeletal muscle passive stiffness, relative to that of the extracellular matrix, a mouse model was created in which titin’s molecular spring region was shortened by deleting 47 exons, the <i>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></i> model. RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy predicts a much stiffer titin molecule. Mechanical studies with this novel mouse model support that titin is the main determinant of skeletal muscle passive stiffness. Unexpectedly, the in vivo sarcomere length working range was shifted to shorter lengths in <i>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></i> mice, due to a ~ 30% increase in the number of sarcomeres in series (longitudinal hypertrophy). The expected effect of this shift on active force generation was minimized through a shortening of thin filaments that was discovered in <i>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></i> mice. Thus, skeletal muscle titin is the dominant determinant of physiological passive stiffness and drives longitudinal hypertrophy.

Neurokinin B (NKB) signaling is critical for reproduction in all studied species. The existing consensus is that NKB induces GnRH release via kisspeptin (<i>Kiss1</i>) stimulation in the arcuate nucleus. However, the stimulatory action of NKB is dependent on circulating estrogen (E<sub>2</sub>) levels, without which, NKB inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Importantly, the evidence supporting the kisspeptin-dependent role of NKB, derives from models of persistent hypogonadal state [e.g. <i>Kiss1r</i> knock-out (KO) mice], with reduced E<sub>2</sub> levels. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of E<sub>2</sub>, NKB signaling induces LH release in a kisspeptin-independent manner through the activation of NK3R (NKB receptor) neurons in the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD). Importantly, we show that chemogenetic activation of MePD Kiss1 neurons induces LH release, however, the stimulatory action of NKB in this area is Kiss1 neuron-independent. These results document the existence of two independent neuronal circuitries within the MePD that regulate reproductive function in females.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40232">Conserved and divergent development of brainstem vestibular and auditory nuclei</a></h4>

Vestibular function was established early in vertebrates and has remained, for the most part, unchanged. In contrast, each group of tetrapods underwent independent evolutionary processes to solve the problem of hearing on land, resulting in a remarkable mixture of conserved, divergent and convergent features that define extant auditory systems. The vestibuloacoustic nuclei of the hindbrain develop from a highly conserved ground plan and provide an ideal framework on which to address the participation of developmental processes to the evolution of neuronal circuits. We employed an electroporation strategy to unravel the contribution of two dorsoventral and four axial lineages to the development of the chick hindbrain vestibular and auditory nuclei. We compare the chick developmental map with recently stablished genetic fate-maps of the developing mouse hindbrain. Overall, we find considerable conservation of developmental origin for the vestibular nuclei. In contrast, a comparative analysis of the developmental origin of hindbrain auditory structures echoes the complex evolutionary history of the auditory system. In particular, we find that the developmental origin of the chick auditory interaural time difference circuit supports its emergence from an ancient vestibular network, unrelated to the analogous mammalian counterpart.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It has been reported that fast-acting antidepressants enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the fast-acting antidepressants lead to an activation of AMPAR pathways remain largely unclear. To address this issue, a novel AMPAR positive allosteric agonist, PF-4778574, was used to test the rapid effects and the role of VGF (nonacronymic)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/AKT signaling in these actions in mice. We found that PF-4778574 rapidly alleviated chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, knock down of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in the PFC of mice induced depression-like behaviors, whereas treatment with PF-4778574 was sufficient to alleviate it, indicating a presynaptic VGLUT1 independent effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibitors of AMPAR or of L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (L-VDCC) blocked the antidepressants’ effect on behaviors and the upregulation on the AMPAR-mediated VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling of PF-4778574. Together, our findings indicate that postsynaptic AMPAR activation followed by activation of L-VDCC and subsequent VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling are required for the rapid antidepressant effects of PF-4778574. Our data support a promising therapeutic profile for PF-4778574 as a new fast-acting antidepressant.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the majority of neuroimaging studies have focused on the analysis of cortical morphology. White matter changes remain less understood, particularly their association to cortical structure and function. Here, we focused on region that has gained only little attention in ASD neuroimaging: the superficial white matter (SWM) immediately beneath the cortical interface, a compartment playing a prominent role in corticogenesis that incorporates long- and short-range fibers implicated in corticocortical connectivity. Studying a multicentric dataset of ASD and neurotypical controls, we harnessed surface-based techniques to aggregate microstructural SWM diffusion features. Multivariate analysis revealed SWM anomalies in ASD compared with controls in medial parietal and temporoparietal regions. Effects were similar in children and adolescents/adults and consistent across sites. Although SWM anomalies were more confined when correcting for cortical thickness and surface area, findings were overall robust. Diffusion anomalies modulated functional connectivity reductions in ASD and related to symptom severity. Furthermore, mediation models indicated a link between SWM changes, functional connectivity, and symptom load. Analyses targeting the SWM offer a novel perspective on the interplay between structural and functional network perturbations in ASD, highlighting a potentially important neurobiological substrate contributing to its diverse behavioral phenotype.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>When moving, the spatiotemporal unfolding of events is bound to our physical trajectory, and time and space become entangled in episodic memory. When imagining past or future events, or being in different geographical locations, the temporal and spatial dimensions of mental events can be independently accessed and manipulated. Using time-resolved neuroimaging, we characterized brain activity while participants ordered historical events from different mental perspectives in time (e.g., when imagining being 9 years in the future) or in space (e.g., when imagining being in Cayenne). We describe 2 neural signatures of temporal ordinality: an early brain response distinguishing whether participants were mentally in the past, the present or the future (self-projection in time), and a graded activity at event retrieval, indexing the mental distance between the representation of the self in time and the event. Neural signatures of ordinality and symbolic distances in time were distinct from those observed in the homologous spatial task: activity indicating spatial order and distances overlapped in latency in distinct brain regions. We interpret our findings as evidence that the conscious representation of time and space share algorithms (egocentric mapping, distance, and ordinality computations) but different implementations with a distinctive status for the psychological “time arrow.”</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Tau and amyloid β (Aβ), 2 key pathogenic proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), reportedly spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Models of how these pathogenic proteins spread from affected to unaffected areas had been proposed based on the observation that these proteins could transmit to other regions either through neural fibers (transneuronal spread model) or through extracellular space (local spread model). In this study, we modeled the spread of tau and Aβ using a graph theoretical approach based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We tested whether these models predict the distribution of tau and Aβ in the brains of AD spectrum patients. To assess the models’ performance, we calculated spatial correlation between the model-predicted map and the actual map from tau and amyloid positron emission tomography. The transneuronal spread model predicted the distribution of tau and Aβ deposition with significantly higher accuracy than the local spread model. Compared with tau, the local spread model also predicted a comparable portion of Aβ deposition. These findings provide evidence of transneuronal spread of AD pathogenic proteins in a large-scale brain network and furthermore suggest different contributions of spread models for tau and Aβ in AD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Females might possess protective mechanisms regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and require a higher detrimental load, including structural brain alterations, before developing clinically relevant levels of autistic traits. This study examines sex differences in structural brain morphology in autism and autistic traits using a within-twin pair approach. Twin design inherently controls for shared confounders and enables the study of gene-independent neuroanatomical variation. <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 148 twins (62 females) from 49 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic same-sex pairs were included. Participants were distributed along the whole continuum of autism including twin pairs discordant and concordant for clinical ASD. Regional brain volume, surface area, and cortical thickness were computed. Within-twin pair increases in autistic traits were related to decreases in cortical volume and surface area of temporal and frontal regions specifically in female twin pairs, in particular regions involved in social communication, while only two regions were associated with autistic traits in males. The same pattern was detected in the monozygotic twin pairs only. Thus, non-shared environmental factors seem to impact female more than male cerebral architecture associated with autistic traits. Our results are in line with the hypothesis of a female protective effect in autism and highlights the need to study ASD in females separately from males.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopamine modulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates diverse effects on neuronal physiology and function, but the expression of dopamine receptors at subpopulations of projection neurons and interneurons remains unresolved. Here, we examine D1 receptor expression and modulation at specific cell types and layers in the mouse prelimbic PFC. We first show that D1 receptors are enriched in pyramidal cells in both layers 5 and 6, and that these cells project to intratelencephalic targets including contralateral cortex, striatum, and claustrum rather than to extratelencephalic structures. We then find that D1 receptors are also present in interneurons and enriched in superficial layer VIP-positive (VIP+) interneurons that coexpresses calretinin but absent from parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons. Finally, we determine that D1 receptors strongly and selectively enhance action potential firing in only a subset of these corticocortical neurons and VIP+ interneurons. Our findings define several novel subpopulations of D1+ neurons, highlighting how modulation via D1 receptors can influence both excitatory and disinhibitory microcircuits in the PFC.</span>

The previous decade has seen a rapid increase in microglial studies on pain, with a unique focus on microgliosis in the spinal cord after nerve injury and neuropathic pain. Numerous signaling molecules are altered in microglia and contribute to the pathogenesis of pain. Here, we discuss how microglial signaling regulates spinal cord synaptic plasticity in acute and chronic pain conditions with different degrees and variations of microgliosis. We highlight that microglial mediators such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are powerful neuromodulators that regulate synaptic transmission and pain via neuron-glial interactions. We also reveal an emerging role of microglia in the resolution of pain, in part via specialized pro-resolving mediators including resolvins, protectins, and maresins. We also discuss a possible role of microglia in chronic itch.

<p>by Wang Xi, Michael A. Beer</p>

We report an experimental design issue in recent machine learning formulations of the enhancer-promoter interaction problem arising from the fact that many enhancer-promoter pairs share features. Cross-fold validation schemes which do not correctly separate these feature sharing enhancer-promoter pairs into one test set report high accuracy, which is actually arising from high training set accuracy and a failure to properly evaluate generalization performance. Cross-fold validation schemes which properly segregate pairs with shared features show markedly reduced ability to predict enhancer-promoter interactions from epigenomic state. Parameter scans with multiple models indicate that local epigenomic features of individual pairs of enhancers and promoters cannot distinguish those pairs that interact from those which do with high accuracy, suggesting that additional information is required to predict enhancer-promoter interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ku6iX2aK_S8" width="1" />

<p>A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception <i>in vivo</i> by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, DPCPX; 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons shows that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of EPSCs but not IPSCs. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK)-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0241-18.2018?rss=1">Superior Visual Timing Sensitivity in Auditory But Not Visual World Class Drum Corps Experts</a></h4>

<p>World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from the color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly subdivide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments (TOJs) more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right, called a TOJ. Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard members from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did the color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 ms (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 ms (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intramodally, even when intramodal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the timing sensitivity of the nervous system.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that ovarian cycle stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice and increasing amyloid beta levels. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.</p>

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin disease in children. It is characterized by relapsing inflammation, skin-barrier defects, and intractable itch. However, the pathophysiology of itch in AD remains enigmatic.

Genomic imprinting mediated by DNA methylation restricts gene expression to a single allele determined by parental origin and is not generally considered to be under genetic or environmental influence. Here, we focused on a differentially methylated region (DMR) of approximately 1.9 kb that includes a 101-bp noncoding RNA gene (nc886/VTRNA2-1),...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/JReCTYqQqFA" width="1" />

The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1 complex plays important roles in the DNA damage response by activating the Tel1ATM kinase and catalyzing 5′–3′ resection at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). To initiate resection, Mre11 endonuclease nicks the 5′ strands at DSB ends in a reaction stimulated by Sae2CtIP. Accordingly, Mre11-nuclease deficient (mre11-nd) and sae2Δ mutants...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/RpNfJuNvBXg" width="1" />

Gut bacteria can affect key aspects of host fitness, such as development, fecundity, and lifespan, while the host, in turn, shapes the gut microbiome. However, it is unclear to what extent individual species versus community interactions within the microbiome are linked to host fitness. Here, we combinatorially dissect the natural...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/yMjiu1zYabc" width="1" />

Abundant and essential motifs, such as phosphate-binding loops (P-loops), are presumed to be the seeds of modern enzymes.

<p>Cortical neurons exhibit rich dynamics, shaped by the presence of
history-dependent biophysical mechanisms such as adaptation over different time
scales. On the other hand, cortical circuits are highly recurrent which can
result in chaotic network dynamics even if network nodes have simple dynamics.
We analyze how the dynamics of nodes (such as single neurons) and recurrent
connections interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly
connected networks. A novel dynamical mean-field theory for networks of
multi-dimensional rate units shows that, despite the nonlinear interactions
between units, the recurrent network dynamics inherit, in the chaotic phase,
the qualitative features of the linear response properties of the single units.
For the case of two-dimensional rate units with strong adaptation, we find that
the network exhibits a state of "resonant chaos", whose resonance frequency can
be predicted from the properties of isolated units. The correlation time of the
chaotic network scales with the adaptation timescale of a single unit. Our
theory for network analysis can be applied to numerous other mechanisms at the
level of single nodes, such as synaptic filtering, refractoriness or spike
synchronization. These results advance our understanding of the interaction
between single-neuron mechanisms and recurrent connectivity, a fundamental step
toward the description of biologically realistic network models in the brain,
or, more generally, networks of other physical or man-made complex dynamical
units.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06919">Contrasting the effects of adaptation and synaptic filtering on the timescales of dynamics in recurrent networks. (arXiv:1812.06919v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Neural activity exhibits a vast range of timescales that can be several fold
larger than the membrane time constant of individual neurons. Two types of
mechanisms have been proposed to explain this conundrum. One possibility is
that large timescales are generated by a network mechanism based on positive
feedback, but this hypothesis requires fine-tuning of the synaptic connections.
A second possibility is that large timescales in the neural dynamics are
inherited from large timescales of underlying biophysical processes, two
prominent candidates being adaptive ionic currents and synaptic transmission.
How the timescales of these processes influence the timescale of the network
dynamics has however not been fully explored. To address this question, we
analyze large networks of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory units
with additional degrees of freedom that correspond to adaptation or synaptic
filtering. We determine the fixed points of the systems, their stability to
perturbations and the corresponding dynamical timescales. Furthermore, we apply
dynamical mean field theory to study the temporal statistics of the activity in
the fluctuating regime, and examine how the adaptation and synaptic timescales
transfer from individual units to the whole population. Our overarching finding
is that synaptic filtering and adaptation in single neurons have very different
effects at the network level. Unexpectedly, the macroscopic network dynamics do
not inherit the large timescale present in adaptive currents. In contrast, the
timescales of network activity increase proportionally to the time constant of
the synaptic filter. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the timescales of
different biophysical processes have different effects on the network level, so
that the slow processes within individual neurons do not necessarily induce
slow activity in large recurrent neural networks.

<p>Recordings of electrical brain activity carry information about a person's
cognitive health. For recording EEG signals, a very common setting is for a
subject to be at rest with its eyes closed. Analysis of these recordings often
involve a dimensionality reduction step in which electrodes are grouped into 10
or more regions (depending on the number of electrodes available). Then an
average over each group is taken which serves as a feature in subsequent
evaluation. Currently, the most prominent features used in clinical practice
are based on spectral power densities. In our work we consider a simplified
grouping of electrodes into two regions only. In addition to spectral features
we introduce a secondary, non-redundant view on brain activity through the lens
of Tsallis Entropy $S_{q=2}$. We further take EEG measurements not only in an
eyes closed (ec) but also in an eyes open (eo) state. For our cohort of healthy
controls (HC) and individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD), the
question we are asking is the following: How well can one discriminate between
HC and PD within this simplified, binary grouping? This question is motivated
by the commercial availability of inexpensive and easy to use portable EEG
devices. If enough information is retained in this binary grouping, then such
simple devices could potentially be used as personal monitoring tools, as
standard screening tools by general practitioners or as digital biomarkers for
easy long term monitoring during neurological studies.

<p>In lieu of an abstract here is the first paragraph: No other species remotely
approaches the human capacity for the cultural evolution of novelty that is
accumulative, adaptive, and open-ended (i.e., with no a priori limit on the
size or scope of possibilities). By culture we mean extrasomatic
adaptations--including behavior and technology--that are socially rather than
sexually transmitted. This chapter synthesizes research from anthropology,
psychology, archaeology, and agent-based modeling into a speculative yet
coherent account of two fundamental cognitive transitions underlying human
cultural evolution that is consistent with contemporary psychology. While the
chapter overlaps with a more technical paper on this topic (Gabora &amp; Smith
2018), it incorporates new research and elaborates a genetic component to our
overall argument. The ideas in this chapter grew out of a non-Darwinian
framework for cultural evolution, referred to as the Self-other Reorganization
(SOR) theory of cultural evolution (Gabora, 2013, in press; Smith, 2013), which
was inspired by research on the origin and earliest stage in the evolution of
life (Cornish-Bowden &amp; C\'ardenas 2017; Goldenfeld, Biancalani, &amp; Jafarpour,
2017, Vetsigian, Woese, &amp; Goldenfeld 2006; Woese, 2002). SOR bridges
psychological research on fundamental aspects of our human nature such as
creativity and our proclivity to reflect on ideas from different perspectives,
with the literature on evolutionary approaches to cultural evolution that
aspire to synthesize the behavioral sciences much as has been done for the
biological scientists. The current chapter is complementary to this effort, but
less abstract; it attempts to ground the theory of cultural evolution in terms
of cognitive transitions as suggested by archaeological evidence.

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) possess energy-efficient potential due to
event-based computation. However, supervised training of SNNs remains a
challenge as spike activities are non-differentiable. Previous SNNs training
methods can basically be categorized into two classes, backpropagation-like
training methods and plasticity-based learning methods. The former methods are
dependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation and non-local
transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks (ANNs), while the
latter either be considered biologically implausible or exhibit poor
performance. Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible) high-performance
supervised learning (SL) methods for SNNs remain deficient. In this paper, we
proposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based on the symmetric
spike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in neuroscience. By
combining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic scaling and intrinsic
plasticity of the dynamic threshold, our SNN model implemented SL well and
achieved good performance in the benchmark recognition task (MNIST). To reveal
the underlying mechanism of our SL model, we visualized both layer-based
activities and synaptic weights using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) method after training and found that they were well
clustered, thereby demonstrating excellent classification ability. As the
learning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on local spike events, our
model could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware for online training and
may be helpful for understanding SL information processing at the synaptic
level in biological neural systems.

<p>Detecting epileptic seizure through analysis of the electroencephalography
(EEG) signal becomes a standard method for the diagnosis of epilepsy. In a
manual way, monitoring of long term EEG is tedious and error prone. Therefore,
a reliable automatic seizure detection method is desirable. A critical
challenge to automatic seizure detection is that seizure morphologies exhibit
considerable variabilities. In order to capture essential seizure patterns,
this paper leverages an attention mechanism and a bidirectional long short-term
memory (BiLSTM) model to exploit both spatially and temporally discriminating
features and account for seizure variabilities. The attention mechanism is to
capture spatial features more effectively according to the contributions of
brain areas to seizures. The BiLSTM model is to extract more discriminating
temporal features in the forward and the backward directions. By accounting for
both spatial and temporal variations of seizures, the proposed method is more
robust across subjects. The testing results over the noisy real data of CHB-MIT
show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.
In both mixing-patients and cross-patient experiments, the average sensitivity
and specificity are both higher while their corresponding standard deviations
are lower than the methods in comparison.

<p>We have performed the comparative spectral analysis of structural connectomes
for various organisms using open-access data. Our analysis indicates several
new peculiar features of the human connectome. We found that the spectral
density of human connectome has the maximal deviation from the spectral density
of the randomized network compared to all other organisms. For many animals
except human structural peculiarities of connectomes are well reproduced in the
network evolution induced by the preference of 3-cycles formation. To get the
reliable fit , we discovered the crucial role of the conservation of local
clusterization in human connectome evolution. We investigated for the first
time the level spacing distribution in the spectrum of human connectome graph
Laplacian. It turns out that the spectral statistics of human connectome
corresponds exactly to the critical regime familiar in the condensed matter
physics which is hybrid of Wigner-Dyson and Poisson distributions. This
observation provides the strong support for the much debated statement of the
brain criticality.

<p>An ability to map seizure-generating brain tissue, i.e., the seizure onset
zone (SOZ), without recording actual seizures could reduce the duration of
invasive EEG monitoring for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A
widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence
(events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers
associated with epileptic brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous
seizures recorded with intracranial EEG, primarily using a single biomarker.
Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from their inability to
generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient
variability and (b) the temporal variability in the epileptogenic activity.
Here, we report an artificial intelligence-based approach for combining
multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal
characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it
can reliably identify seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who
underwent evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Our investigation provides
evidence that utilizing the complementary information provided by multiple
electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics can
significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously
published single-biomarker incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average
area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in a cohort of 82 patients. Our
results also suggest that recording durations between ninety minutes and two
hours are sufficient to localize SOZs with accuracies that may prove clinically
relevant. The successful validation of our approach on a large cohort of 82
patients warrants future investigation on the feasibility of utilizing
intra-operative EEG monitoring and artificial intelligence to localize
epileptogenic brain tissue.

<p>Changes in brain states, as found in many neurological diseases such as
epilepsy, are often described as bifurcations in mesoscopic neural models.
Nearly all of these models rely on a mathematically convenient, but
biophysically inaccurate, description of the synaptic input to neurons called
current-based synapses. We develop a novel analytical framework to analyze the
effects of a more biophysically realistic description, known as
conductance-based synapses. These are implemented in a mesoscopic neural model
and compared to the standard approximation via a single parameter homotopic
mapping. A bifurcation analysis using the homotopy parameter demonstrates that
if a more realistic synaptic coupling mechanism is used in this class of
models, then a bifurcation or transition to an abnormal brain state does not
occur in the same parameter space. We show that the more realistic coupling has
additional mathematical parameters that require a fundamentally different
biophysical mechanism to undergo a state transition. These results demonstrate
the importance of incorporating more realistic synapses in mesoscopic neural
models and challenge the accuracy of previous models, especially those
describing brain state transitions such as epilepsy.

<p>Inspired by applications to theories of coding and communication in networks
of nervous tissue, we study maximum entropy distributions on weighted graphs
with a given expected degree sequence. These distributions are characterized by
independent edge weights parameterized by a shared vector of vertex potentials.
Using the general theory of exponential family distributions, we derive the
existence and uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the
vertex parameters. We also prove consistency of the MLE from a single sample in
the limit of large graphs, extending results of Chatterjee, Diaconis, and Sly
in the unweighted case (the "beta-model" in statistics). Interestingly, our
proofs require tight estimates on the norms of inverses of symmetric,
diagonally dominant positive matrices. Along the way, we derive analogues of
the Erdos-Gallai criterion of graphical degree sequences for weighted graphs.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Blindness early in life induces permanent alterations in brain anatomy, including reduced surface area of primary visual cortex (V1). Bilateral enucleation early in development causes greater reductions in primary visual cortex surface area than at later times. However, the time at which cortical surface area expansion is no longer sensitive to enucleation is not clearly established, despite being an important milestone for cortical development. Using histological and MRI techniques, we investigated how reductions in the surface area of V1 depends on the timing of blindness onset in rats, ferrets and humans. To compare data across species, we translated ages of all species to a common neuro-developmental event-time (ET) scale. Consistently, blindness during early cortical expansion induced large (~40%) reductions in V1 surface area, in rats and ferrets, while blindness occurring later had diminishing effects. Longitudinal measurements on ferrets confirmed that early enucleation disrupted cortical expansion, rather than inducing enhanced pruning. We modeled the ET associated with the conclusion of the effect of blindness on surface area at maturity (ET<sub>c</sub>), relative to the normal conclusion of visual cortex surface area expansion, (ET<sub>dev)</sub>. A final analysis combining our data with extant published data confirmed that ET<sub>c</sub> occurred well before ET<sub>dev</sub>.</span>

<p>by Wojciech Potrzebowski, Jill Trewhella, Ingemar Andre</p>

Many proteins consist of folded domains connected by regions with higher flexibility. The details of the resulting conformational ensemble play a central role in controlling interactions between domains and with binding partners. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is well-suited to study the conformational states adopted by proteins in solution. However, analysis is complicated by the limited information content in SAS data and care must be taken to avoid constructing overly complex ensemble models and fitting to noise in the experimental data. To address these challenges, we developed a method based on Bayesian statistics that infers conformational ensembles from a structural library generated by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. The first stage of the method involves a fast model selection based on variational Bayesian inference that maximizes the model evidence of the selected ensemble. This is followed by a complete Bayesian inference of population weights in the selected ensemble. Experiments with simulated ensembles demonstrate that model evidence is capable of identifying the correct ensemble and that correct number of ensemble members can be recovered up to high level of noise. Using experimental data, we demonstrate how the method can be extended to include data from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and structural energies of conformers extracted from the all-atom energy functions. We show that the data from SAXS, NMR chemical shifts and energies calculated from conformers can work synergistically to improve the definition of the conformational ensemble.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vea5WEX4qTU" width="1" />

Early assessment of infectious disease outbreaks is key to implementing timely and effective control measures. In particular, rapidly recognising whether infected individuals stem from a single outbreak sustained by local transmission, or from repeated introductions, is crucial to adopt effective interventions. In this study, we introduce a new framework for combining several data streams, e.g. temporal, spatial and genetic data, to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. Our method explicitly accounts for underreporting, and allows incorporating preexisting information about the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate. We define, for each data stream, a graph connecting all cases, with edges weighted by the corresponding pairwise distance between cases. Each graph is then pruned by removing distances greater than a given cutoff, defined based on preexisting information on the disease and assumptions on the reporting rate. The pruned graphs corresponding to different data streams are then merged by intersection to combine all data types; connected components define clusters of cases related for all types of data. Estimates of the reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), and the rate of importation of the disease into the population, are also derived. We test our approach on simulated data and illustrate it using data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. We show that the outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex, computationally intensive approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Azw7xP5tw5w" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Neurodegeneration is a process transversal to neuropsychiatric diseases and the understanding of its mechanisms should allow devising strategies to prevent this irreversible step in brain diseases. Neurodegeneration caused by seizures is a critical step in the aggravation of temporal lobe epilepsy, but its mechanisms remain undetermined. Convulsions trigger an elevation of extracellular adenosine and upregulate adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R), which have been associated with the control of neurodegenerative diseases. Using the rat and mouse kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we now tested if A<sub>2A</sub>R control convulsions-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. The pharmacological or genetic blockade of A<sub>2A</sub>R did not affect kainate-induced convulsions but dampened the subsequent neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity began with a rapid A<sub>2A</sub>R upregulation within glutamatergic synapses (within 2 hours), through local translation of synaptic A<sub>2A</sub>R mRNA. This bolstered A<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated facilitation of glutamate release and of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 synapses (4 hours), triggering a subsequent synaptotoxicity, heralded by decreased synaptic plasticity and loss of synaptic markers coupled to calpain activation (12 hours), that predated overt neuronal loss (24 hours). All modifications were prevented by the deletion of A<sub>2A</sub>R selectively in forebrain neurons. This shows that synaptic A<sub>2A</sub>R critically controls synaptic excitotoxicity, which underlies the development of convulsions-induced neurodegeneration.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Epilepsy is an evolving disease where neurodegeneration is associated with the aggravation of subsequent convulsions. We now unveil that the up-regulation of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R) is paramount to link convulsions to neurodegeneration. This involves a translation of A<sub>2A</sub>R within synapses to bolster the activity of excitatory glutamatergic synapses and triggers an excitotoxicity first of synapses, that later evolves into neurodegeneration through increased calpain activity. Accordingly, the pharmacological or genetic blockade of A<sub>2A</sub>R arrested neurodegeneration, thus prompting A<sub>2A</sub>R as novel targets to alleviate neuronal damage associated with epilepsy.</p>

Abstract<p>Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) recorded from the ear canal in the absence of sound reflect cochlear amplification, an outer-hair-cell (OHC) process required for the extraordinary sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Although wild-type mice rarely emit, those with mutations that influence the tectorial membrane (TM) show an incidence of SOAEs similar to that in humans. In this report, we characterized mice with a missense mutation in <i>Tecta,</i> a gene required for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix within the core of the TM. Mice heterozygous for the Y1870C mutation <i>(Tecta<sup>Y1870C/+</sup>)</i> are prolific emitters, despite a moderate hearing loss. Additionally, Kimura’s membrane, into which the OHC stereocilia insert, separates from the main body of the TM, except at apical cochlear locations. Multimodal SOAEs are also observed in <i>Tecta<sup>Y1870C/+</sup></i> mice where energy is present at frequencies that are integer multiples of a lower-frequency SOAE (the primary). Second-harmonic SOAEs, at twice the frequency of a lower-frequency primary, are the most frequently observed. These secondary SOAEs are found in spatial regions where stimulus-evoked OAEs are small or in the noise floor. Introduction of high-level suppressors just above the primary SOAE frequency reduce or eliminate both primary and second-harmonic SOAEs. In contrast, second-harmonic SOAEs are not affected by suppressors, either above or below the second-harmonic SOAE frequency, even when they are much larger in amplitude. Hence, second-harmonic SOAEs do not appear to be spatially separated from their primaries, a finding that has implications for cochlear mechanics and the consequences of changes to TM structure.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Aspects of cochlear function can be observed non-invasively by placing a sensitive microphone in the ear canal and recording stimulus-evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). These responses provide information about the operation of the outer hair cells (OHCs), which are required for sensitivity and frequency selectivity, the hallmarks of normal cochlear operation in mammals. In addition to stimulus-related OAEs, spontaneous OAEs (SOAEs) are frequently observed in humans as narrow-band signals in the absence of sound. Although wild-type mice are rarely spontaneous emitters, those with an altered tectorial membrane, the accessory structure to which the OHC stereocilia are attached, exhibit a dramatic increase in these phenomena. Determining the underlying basis for this phenotype has the potential to reveal important aspects of cochlear function.</p>

Abstract<p>The β-band oscillation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a therapeutic target for Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies demonstrated that L-dopa decreases the β-band (13–30 Hz) oscillations with improvement of motor symptoms. However, it has not been elucidated whether patients with Parkinson’s disease are able to control the β-band oscillation voluntarily. Here, we hypothesized that neurofeedback training to control the β-band power in the STN induces plastic changes in the STN of individuals with Parkinson’s disease. We recorded the signals from STN-deep brain stimulation electrodes during operations to replace implantable pulse generators in eight human patients (three male) with bilateral electrodes. Four patients were induced to decrease the β-band power during the feedback training (down-training condition), whereas the other patients were induced to increase (up-training condition). All patients were blinded to their assigned condition. Adjacent contacts that showed the highest β-band power were selected for the feedback. During the 10-minute training, patients were shown a circle whose diameter was controlled by the β-band power of the selected contacts. Powers in the β-band during 5-minute resting sessions recorded before and after the feedback were compared. In the down-training condition, the β-band power of the selected contacts decreased significantly after feedback in all four patients (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). In contrast, the β-band power significantly increased after feedback in two of four patients in the up-training condition. Overall, the patients could voluntarily control the β-band power in STN in the instructed direction (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) through neurofeedback.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Many studies have reported a relationship between the β-band power in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Here, we have developed a novel neurofeedback technique using intracranial electrodes implanted in deep brain structures to modulate STN activity. We provided direct feedback of the β-band power as the size of a black disc to induce a sustainable change in β-band power. As a result, the neurofeedback training induced significant changes in the β-band power. This is the first report to demonstrate that human patients with Parkinson’s disease were able to voluntarily control their β-band power in STN to induce changes in the power.</p>

Abstract<p>The study of neuronal dendritic orientation is of interest because it is related to how neurons grow dendrites to establish the synaptic input that neurons receive. The dendritic orientations of neurons in the nervous system vary, ranging from rather heterogeneously distributed (asymmetric) to homogeneously distributed (symmetric) dendritic arbors. Here we analyze the dendritic orientation of the basal dendrites of intracellularly labeled pyramidal neurons from horizontal sections of layers II-VI of the hindlimb somatosensory cortex of 14-day-old rats (P14). We used circular statistics and proposed two new graphical descriptive representations of the neuron. We found that the dendritic pattern of most neurons was asymmetric. Furthermore, we found that there is a mixture of different types of orientations within any given group of neurons in any cortical layer. In addition, we investigated whether dendritic orientation was related to the physical location within the brain with respect to the anterior, dorsal, posterior and ventral directions. Generally, there was a preference towards the anterior orientation. A comparison between layers revealed that the preference for the anterior orientation was more pronounced in neurons located in layers II, III, IV and Va than for the neurons located in layers Vb and VI. The dorsal orientation was the least preferred orientation in all layers, except for layers IV and Va where the ventral orientation had the lowest preference. Therefore, the orientation of basal dendritic arbors of pyramidal cells is variable and asymmetric, although a majority has a single orientation with a preference for the anterior direction in P14 rats.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is thought that the dendritic arborizations of pyramidal cells are oriented to make contact with relevant synaptic inputs. It could be expected that these arborizations are distributed uniformly around the soma. We used circular statistics and two new graphical descriptive representations of the neuron to study the orientation of basal dendritic arbors in the rat somatosensory cortex. We observed that the basal dendritic pattern of most neurons was asymmetric and that was a mixture of different types of orientations within any given group of neurons in any cortical layer. Nevertheless, we found a large proportion of cells showing a preference for the anterior orientation axis, suggesting that these cells have a preference for an axonal system oriented in this direction.</p>

<p>In human memory, forgetting occur rapidly after the remembering and the rate
of forgetting slowed down as time went. This is so-called the Ebbinghaus
forgetting curve. There are many explanations of how this curve occur based on
the properties of the brains. In this article, we use a simple mathematical
model to explain the mechanism of forgetting based on rearrangement inequality
and get a general formalism for short-term and long-term memory and use it to
fit the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. We also find out that forgetting is not a
flaw, instead it is help to improve the efficiency of remembering when human
confront different situations by reducing the interference of information and
reducing the number of retrievals. Furthurmove, we find that the interference
of informations limits the capacity of human memory, which is the "magic number
seven".

Royal et al. demonstrate that migraine-associated frameshift mutations of TRESK, a two-pore-domain K+ channel, lead to the production of a second protein fragment, which carries the pathophysiological function by inhibiting TREK1 and 2, due to a mechanism called frameshift mutation-induced alternative translation initiation (fsATI).

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Several studies have shown age-related changes in motor imagery (MI) in older adults and the associated compensatory brain activation patterns; most of these studies have used explicit MI tasks or implicit MI tasks focused on mental rotation of body parts. Here, we address the effect of ageing on MI for the more complex visuomotor transformations entailed by mentally simulated hand-tool interactions triggered by a grip selection task (GST) for tools used in daily life. We studied 22 young and 22 elderly subjects performing the GST, in which they were asked to report whether they would grip a portrayed tool with an overhand or an underhand grip. We found a behavioral decline in the elderly group, accompanied by reduced activations of the left posterior parietal lobule, in a subregion associated specifically with reaching behavior by previous investigations. No differences were observed in the temporal cortices associated with object semantics. These results suggested a specific age-related vulnerability of the neural substrates, particularly for the imaginary reaching component of the task, rather than for the semantically driven grasping component. The combination of behavioral deficits and reduced activation of specific brain regions speaks in favor of a specific age-associated deficit for the complex imaginary movements required by the GST.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although it is well-established that human language functions are mostly lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain, little is known about the functional mechanisms underlying such hemispheric dominance. The present study investigated intrinsic organization of the whole brain at rest, by means of functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis, with the aim to characterize brain functional organization underlying typical and atypical language dominance. We included healthy left-handers, both those with typical left-lateralized language and those with atypical right-lateralized language. Results show that 1) differences between typical and atypical language lateralization are associated with functional connectivity within the language system, particularly with weakened connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus and several other language-related areas; and 2) for participants with atypical language dominance, the degree of lateralization is linked with multiple functional connectivities and graph theoretical metrics of whole brain organization, including local efficiency and small-worldness. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that linked the degree of language lateralization to global topology of brain networks. These results reveal that typical and atypical language dominance mainly differ in functional connectivity within the language system, and that atypical language dominance is associated with whole-brain organization.</span>

Advances in sequencing technology have significantly expanded our understanding of the genetics of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Continued technological improvements and cost reductions have now shifted the focus to investigations into the functional noncoding portions of the genome. There is a patient trend toward an excess of de novo and potentially disruptive mutations among conserved noncoding sequences implicated in the regulation of genes. The signals become stronger when restricted to genes already implicated in NDDs, but de novo mutation in such elements is estimated to account for &lt;5% of patients.

<p>by Kellen Chen, Xiao Hu, Silvia S. Blemker, Jeffrey W. Holmes</p>

Mechanical stimulation of the healing tendon is thought to regulate scar anisotropy and strength and is relatively easy to modulate through physical therapy. However, <i>in vivo</i> studies of various loading protocols in animal models have produced mixed results. To integrate and better understand the available data, we developed a multiscale model of rat Achilles tendon healing that incorporates the effect of changes in the mechanical environment on fibroblast behavior, collagen deposition, and scar formation. We modified an OpenSim model of the rat right hindlimb to estimate physiologic strains in the lateral/medial gastrocnemius and soleus musculo-tendon units during loading and unloading conditions. We used the tendon strains as inputs to a thermodynamic model of stress fiber dynamics that predicts fibroblast alignment, and to determine local collagen synthesis rates according to a response curve derived from <i>in vitro</i> studies. We then used an agent-based model (ABM) of scar formation to integrate these cell-level responses and predict tissue-level collagen alignment and content. We compared our model predictions to experimental data from ten different studies. We found that a single set of cellular response curves can explain features of observed tendon healing across a wide array of reported experiments in rats–including the paradoxical finding that repairing transected tendon reverses the effect of loading on alignment–without fitting model parameters to any data from those experiments. The key to these successful predictions was simulating the specific loading and surgical protocols to predict tissue-level strains, which then guided cellular behaviors according to response curves based on <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Our model results provide a potential explanation for the highly variable responses to mechanical loading reported in the tendon healing literature and may be useful in guiding the design of future experiments and interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEQz9FfgNME" width="1" />

<p>by Danesh Moradigaravand, Martin Palm, Anne Farewell, Ville Mustonen, Jonas Warringer, Leopold Parts</p>

The emergence of microbial antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. In clinical settings, the key to controlling spread of resistant strains is accurate and rapid detection. As traditional culture-based methods are time consuming, genetic approaches have recently been developed for this task. The detection of antibiotic resistance is typically made by measuring a few known determinants previously identified from genome sequencing, and thus requires the prior knowledge of its biological mechanisms. To overcome this limitation, we employed machine learning models to predict resistance to 11 compounds across four classes of antibiotics from existing and novel whole genome sequences of 1936 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains. We considered a range of methods, and examined population structure, isolation year, gene content, and polymorphism information as predictors. Gradient boosted decision trees consistently outperformed alternative models with an average accuracy of 0.91 on held-out data (range 0.81–0.97). While the best models most frequently employed gene content, an average accuracy score of 0.90 could be obtained using population structure information alone. Single nucleotide variation data were less useful, and significantly improved prediction only for two antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin. These results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> can be accurately predicted from whole genome sequences without <i>a priori</i> knowledge of mechanisms, and that both genomic and epidemiological data can be informative. This paves way to integrating machine learning approaches into diagnostic tools in the clinic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LeuFxHi0YgQ" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Many studies have examined how the spiking activity of single neurons can encode stimulus features, such the direction of motion of visual stimuli. However, majority of such studies to date have only recorded from a small number of neurons at the same time, meaning that one cannot adequately account for the trial-to-trial correlations in spiking activity between neurons. Using multi-channel recordings, we were able to measure the neuronal correlations, and their effects on population coding of stimulus features. Our results have implications on the way which neural populations must be read-out in order to maximize information.</p>

G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic-acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that occurrence and location of PQSs are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the PQS classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all PQS present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each PQS in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of PQS abundance. This information is accessible from a database to allow the easy navigation of the results: http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php?id=g4virus. The availability of these data will greatly expedite research on G-quadruplex in viruses, with the possibility to accelerate finding therapeutic opportunities to numerous and some fearsome human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YGXummEGfTY" width="1" />

Next generation sequencing of viral populations has advanced our understanding of viral population dynamics, the development of drug resistance, and escape from host immune responses. Many applications require complete gene sequences, which can be impossible to reconstruct from short reads. HIV <i>env</i>, the protein of interest for HIV vaccine studies, is exceptionally challenging for long-read sequencing and analysis due to its length, high substitution rate, and extensive indel variation. While long-read sequencing is attractive in this setting, the analysis of such data is not well handled by existing methods. To address this, we introduce FLEA (Full-Length Envelope Analyzer), which performs end-to-end analysis and visualization of long-read sequencing data. FLEA consists of both a pipeline (optionally run on a high-performance cluster), and a client-side web application that provides interactive results. The pipeline transforms FASTQ reads into high-quality consensus sequences (HQCSs) and uses them to build a codon-aware multiple sequence alignment. The resulting alignment is then used to infer phylogenies, selection pressure, and evolutionary dynamics. The web application provides publication-quality plots and interactive visualizations, including an annotated viral alignment browser, time series plots of evolutionary dynamics, visualizations of gene-wide selective pressures (such as <i>dN</i>/<i>dS</i>) across time and across protein structure, and a phylogenetic tree browser. We demonstrate how FLEA may be used to process Pacific Biosciences HIV <i>env</i> data and describe recent examples of its use. Simulations show how FLEA dramatically reduces the error rate of this sequencing platform, providing an accurate portrait of complex and variable HIV <i>env</i> populations. A public instance of FLEA is hosted at http://flea.datamonkey.org. The Python source code for the FLEA pipeline can be found at https://github.com/veg/flea-pipeline. The client-side application is available at https://github.com/veg/flea-web-app. A live demo of the P018 results can be found at http://flea.murrell.group/view/P018.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5IGD6XUDrjc" width="1" />

<p>by Itamar Daniel Landau, Haim Sompolinsky</p>

We present a simple model for coherent, spatially correlated chaos in a recurrent neural network. Networks of randomly connected neurons exhibit chaotic fluctuations and have been studied as a model for capturing the temporal variability of cortical activity. The dynamics generated by such networks, however, are spatially uncorrelated and do not generate coherent fluctuations, which are commonly observed across spatial scales of the neocortex. In our model we introduce a structured component of connectivity, in addition to random connections, which effectively embeds a feedforward structure via unidirectional coupling between a pair of orthogonal modes. Local fluctuations driven by the random connectivity are summed by an output mode and drive coherent activity along an input mode. The orthogonality between input and output mode preserves chaotic fluctuations by preventing feedback loops. In the regime of weak structured connectivity we apply a perturbative approach to solve the dynamic mean-field equations, showing that in this regime coherent fluctuations are driven passively by the chaos of local residual fluctuations. When we introduce a row balance constraint on the random connectivity, stronger structured connectivity puts the network in a distinct dynamical regime of self-tuned coherent chaos. In this regime the coherent component of the dynamics self-adjusts intermittently to yield periods of slow, highly coherent chaos. The dynamics display longer time-scales and switching-like activity. We show how in this regime the dynamics depend qualitatively on the particular realization of the connectivity matrix: a complex leading eigenvalue can yield coherent oscillatory chaos while a real leading eigenvalue can yield chaos with broken symmetry. The level of coherence grows with increasing strength of structured connectivity until the dynamics are almost entirely constrained to a single spatial mode. We examine the effects of network-size scaling and show that these results are not finite-size effects. Finally, we show that in the regime of weak structured connectivity, coherent chaos emerges also for a generalized structured connectivity with multiple input-output modes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h3dba5py_SI" width="1" />

Gao et al. demonstrate that Tac1-expressing neurons in the l/vlPAG modulate spinal itch processing via a descending pathway. These neurons represent a critical component in the neural circuit that drives the itch-scratching cycle.

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0402-18.2018v1?rss=1">Primary afferent-derived BDNF contributes minimally to the processing of pain and itch</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical contributor to neuronal growth, development, learning and memory. Though extensively studied in the brain, BDNF is also expressed by primary afferent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Unfortunately, anatomical and functional studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF have been limited by the availability of appropriate molecular tools. Here we used targeted, inducible molecular approaches to characterize the expression pattern of primary afferent BDNF and the extent to which it contributes to a variety of pain and itch behaviors. Using a <i>BDNF-LacZ</i> reporter mouse, we found that BDNF is expressed primarily by myelinated primary afferents and has limited overlap with the major peptidergic and non-peptidergic subclasses of nociceptors and pruritoceptors. We also observed extensive neuronal, but not glial, expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In addition, because BDNF null mice are not viable and even Cre-mediated deletion of BDNF from sensory neurons could have developmental consequences, here we deleted BDNF selectively from sensory neurons, in the adult, using an advillin-Cre-ER line crossed to floxed BDNF mice. We found that BDNF deletion in the adult altered few itch or acute and chronic pain behaviors, beyond sexually dimorphic phenotypes in the tail immersion, histamine and formalin tests. Based on the anatomical distribution of sensory neuron-derived BDNF and its limited contribution to pain and itch processing, we suggest that future studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF should examine behaviors evoked by activation of myelinated primary afferents.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical contributor to neuronal growth, development and synaptic plasticity and its expression in primary sensory neurons has been implicated in pain processing. However, there is little consensus as to the sensory neuron subtypes that express BDNF or whether sensory neuron-derived BDNF facilitates or inhibits pain generation. Here we used a BDNF reporter mouse and demonstrate that BDNF predominates in myelinated sensory neurons and is expressed in many spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. In addition, in studies in which BDNF was deleted, in the adult, from all sensory neurons, we found limited deficits in pain or itch processing.</p>

Abstract<p>We propose a model that includes interactions between the cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus, the internal pallidum (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of basal ganglia to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning, the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates (Macaca mulata) using a novel paradigm predicted by the model.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> In this article, we propose a detailed computational model of interaction between basal ganglia and cortex in which, the former adapts its response according to the outcome while the latter is insensitive to it. The model shows how these two processes interact in order to issue a unique behavioral answer. This prediction has been verified on monkeys, demonstrating how these two processes are both competing (expression) and cooperating (learning). These results suggest that a behavioral decision emerges actually from a dual competition of two distinct but entangled systems.</p>

Abstract<p>The pulsatile release of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key feature of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) trigger GnRH neuronal activity, but how GnRH neurons return to baseline electrical activity is unknown. Nociceptin/orphanin-FQ (OFQ) is an inhibitory neuromodulator. ARC Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, known to receive inputs from ARC kisspeptin neurons, contact GnRH neurons and coexpress OFQ in rat. In the present study, the effect of OFQ(1-13) on GnRH neurons was determined in mouse. We identified transcripts for the OFQ receptor (opioid receptor like 1, ORL1) in GnRH neurons and, using two model systems (explants and slices), found that OFQ exerted a potent inhibition on GnRH neurons, with or without excitatory inputs. We confirmed the inhibition was mediated by ORL1 via G<sub>i/o</sub> protein coupling. The inhibition, occurring independently of levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, was sensitive to inwardly rectifying potassium channels. The only specific blocker of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), was ineffective on the OFQ inhibition. Two GIRK activators, one sharing the binding site of TPNQ and one active only on GIRK1-containing GIRK channels, failed to trigger an inhibition. In contrast, protein kinase C phosphorylation activation known to inhibit GIRK2-mediated currents prevented the OFQ inhibition. These results indicate a specific combination of GIRK subunits, GIRK2/3 in GnRH neurons. <i>In vivo</i>, double labeled OFQ/POMC fibers were found in the vicinity of GnRH neurons and OFQ fibers apposed GnRH neurons. Together, this study brings into light a potent neuromodulator of GnRH neurons.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Fertility is controlled centrally by neurons secreting gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and critically relies on their pulsatile secretory profile. GnRH pulses depend on kisspeptin neurons located in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). However, kisspeptin provides a long-lasting stimulation and how GnRH neurons return to baseline electrical activity is unknown. Here, we show nociceptin/orphanin-FQ (OFQ) potently inhibits GnRH neurons. The signaling pathway involves the receptor, opioid receptor like 1, and downstream effectors G<sub>i/o</sub> protein and G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Notably, the GIRK channels in GnRH neurons exhibit a specific subunit composition, GIRK2/3. Together, these data identify a new messenger in modulating reproductive function.</p>

<p>Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) is a highly effective therapy for movement disorders, yet its mechanism of action remains controversial. Inhibition of local neurons because of release of GABA from afferents to the GPi is a proposed mechanism in patients. Yet, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) produces prolonged membrane depolarization mediated by cholinergic neurotransmission in endopeduncular nucleus (EP, GPi equivalent in rodent) neurons. We applied HFS while recording neuronal firing from an adjacent electrode during microelectrode mapping of GPi in awake patients (both male and female) with Parkinson disease (PD) and dystonia. Aside from after-suppression and no change in neuronal firing, high-frequency microstimulation induced after-facilitation in 38% (26/69) of GPi neurons. In neurons displaying after-facilitation, 10 s HFS led to an immediate decrease of bursting in PD, but not dystonia patients. Moreover, the changes of bursting patterns in neurons with after-suppression or no change after HFS, were similar in both patient groups. To explore the mechanisms responsible, we applied HFS in EP brain slices from rats of either sex. As in humans, HFS in EP induced two subtypes of after-excitation: excitation or excitation with late inhibition. Pharmacological experiments determined that the excitation subtype, induced by lower charge density, was dependent on glutamatergic transmission. HFS with higher charge density induced excitation with late inhibition, which involved cholinergic modulation. Therefore HFS with different charge density may affect the local neurons through multiple synaptic mechanisms. The cholinergic system plays a role in mediating the after-facilitatory effects in GPi neurons, and because of their modulatory nature, may provide a basis for both the immediate and delayed effects of GPi-DBS. We propose a new model to explain the mechanisms of DBS in GPi.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) improves Parkinson disease (PD) and dystonia, yet its mechanisms in GPi remain controversial. Inhibition has been previously described and thought to indicate activation of GABAergic synaptic terminals, which dominate in GPi. Here we report that 10 s high-frequency microstimulation induced after-facilitation of neural firing in a substantial proportion of GPi neurons in humans. The neurons with after-facilitation, also immediately reduced their bursting activities after high-frequency stimulation in PD, but not dystonia patients. Based on these data and further animal experiments, a mechanistic hypothesis involving glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic synaptic transmission is proposed to explain both short- and longer-term therapeutic effects of DBS in GPi.</p>

<p>For many animals, target motion carries high ecological significance as this may be generated by a predator, prey, or potential mate. Indeed, animals whose survival depends on early target detection are often equipped with a sharply tuned visual system, yielding robust performance in challenging conditions. For example, many fast-flying insects use visual cues for identifying targets, such as prey (e.g., predatory dragonflies and robberflies) or conspecifics (e.g., nonpredatory hoverflies), and can often do so against self-generated background optic flow. Supporting these behaviors, the optic lobes of insects that pursue targets harbor neurons that respond robustly to the motion of small moving objects, even when displayed against syn-directional background clutter. However, in diptera, the encoding of target information by the descending neurons, which are more directly involved in generating the behavioral output, has received less attention. We characterized target-selective neurons by recording in the ventral nerve cord of male and female predatory <i>Holcocephala fusca</i> robberflies and of male nonpredatory <i>Eristalis tenax</i> hoverflies. We show that both species have dipteran target-selective descending neurons that only respond to target motion if the background is stationary or moving slowly, moves in the opposite direction, or has un-naturalistic spatial characteristics. The response to the target is suppressed when background and target move at similar velocities, which is strikingly different to the response of target neurons in the optic lobes. As the neurons we recorded from are premotor, our findings affect our interpretation of the neurophysiology underlying target-tracking behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many animals use sensory cues to detect moving targets that may represent predators, prey, or conspecifics. For example, birds of prey show superb sensitivity to the motion of small prey, and intercept these at high speeds. In a similar manner, predatory insects visually track moving prey, often against cluttered backgrounds. Accompanying this behavior, the brains of insects that pursue targets contain neurons that respond exclusively to target motion. We here show that dipteran insects also have target-selective descending neurons in the part of their nervous system that corresponds to the vertebrate spinal cord. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the neurons in the brain, these premotor neurons are inhibited by background patterns moving in the same direction as the target.</p>

<p>To combat retinal degeneration, healthy fetal retinal sheets have been successfully transplanted into both rodent models and humans, with synaptic connectivity between transplant and degenerated host retina having been confirmed. In rodent studies, transplants have been shown to restore responses to flashes of light in a region of the superior colliculus corresponding to the location of the transplant in the host retina. To determine the quality and detail of visual information provided by the transplant, visual responsivity was studied here at the level of visual cortex where higher visual perception is processed. For our model, we used the transgenic <i>Rho-S334ter line-3</i> rat (both sexes), which loses photoreceptors at an early age and is effectively blind at postnatal day 30. These rats received fetal retinal sheet transplants in one eye between 24 and 40 d of age. Three to 10 months following surgery, visually responsive neurons were found in regions of primary visual cortex matching the transplanted region of the retina that were as highly selective as normal rat to stimulus orientation, size, contrast, and spatial and temporal frequencies. Conversely, we found that selective response properties were largely absent in nontransplanted <i>line-3</i> rats. Our data show that fetal retinal sheet transplants can result in remarkably normal visual function in visual cortex of rats with a degenerated host retina and represents a critical step toward developing an effective remedy for the visually impaired human population.</p>

Many patients lose both retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Hence, there is a great demand for the development of efficient techniques that allow for long-term vision restoration. In this study, we transplanted dissected fetal retinal sheets, which can differentiate into photoreceptors and integrate with the host retina of rats with severe retinal degeneration. Remarkably, we show that transplants generated visual responses in cortex similar in quality to normal rats. Furthermore, transplants preserved connectivity within visual cortex and the retinal relay from the lateral geniculate nucleus to visual cortex, supporting their potential application in curing vision loss associated with retinal degeneration.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/50/10692?rss=1">Membrane Potential Correlates of Network Decorrelation and Improved SNR by Cholinergic Activation in the Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

<p>The nucleus basalis (NB) projects cholinergic axons to the cortex, where they play a major role in arousal, attention, and learning. Cholinergic inputs shift cortical dynamics from synchronous to asynchronous and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensory responses. However, the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Using simultaneous extracellular and whole-cell patch recordings in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex, we show that electrical or optogenetic activation of the cholinergic system has a differential effect on ongoing and sensory evoked activities. Cholinergic activation profoundly reduced the large spontaneous fluctuations in membrane potential and decorrelated ongoing activity. However, NB stimulation had no effect on the response to whisker stimulation or on signal correlations. These effects of cholinergic activation provide a unified explanation for the increased SNR of sensory response and for the reduction in noise correlations and explain the shift into the desynchronized cortical state, which are the hallmarks of arousal and attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of cortical sensory response, which may reflect either reduction in background firing rate or increased sensory response. Extracellular recordings showed that attention also reduces the correlation in network activity. These effects are partially mediated by cholinergic axons from the nucleus basalis projecting to the entire cortex. To reveal the cellular and synaptic correlates of these cholinergic effects, we performed simultaneous intracellular and LFP recordings in the somatosensory cortex. Global or local cholinergic activation increased the SNR of sensory response mainly by reducing the rate and amplitude of background synaptic activity and also reduced network correlations. Therefore, coding of sensory information is enhanced by the cholinergic system mainly due to a reduction in spontaneous activity.</p>

<p>The immunopathological states of the brain induced by bacterial lipoproteins have been well characterized by using biochemical and histological assays. However, these studies have limitations in determining functional states of damaged brains involving aberrant synaptic activity and network, which makes it difficult to diagnose brain disorders during bacterial infection. To address this, we investigated the effect of Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> (PAM), a synthetic bacterial lipopeptide, on synaptic dysfunction of female mice brains and cultured neurons in parallel. Our functional brain imaging using PET with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [<sup>18</sup>F] flumazenil revealed that the brain dysfunction induced by PAM is closely aligned to disruption of neurotransmitter-related neuronal activity and functional correlation in the region of the limbic system rather than to decrease of metabolic activity of neurons in the injection area. This finding was verified by <i>in vivo</i> tissue experiments that analyzed synaptic and dendritic alterations in the regions where PET imaging showed abnormal neuronal activity and network. Recording of synaptic activity also revealed that PAM reorganized synaptic distribution and decreased synaptic plasticity in hippocampus. Further study using <i>in vitro</i> neuron cultures demonstrated that PAM decreased the number of presynapses and the frequency of miniature EPSCs, which suggests PAM disrupts neuronal function by damaging presynapses exclusively. We also showed that PAM caused aggregation of synapses around dendrites, which may have caused no significant change in expression level of synaptic proteins, whereas synaptic number and function were impaired by PAM. Our findings could provide a useful guide for diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders specific to bacterial infection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is challenging to diagnose brain disorders caused by bacterial infection because neural damage induced by bacterial products involves nonspecific neurological symptoms, which is rarely detected by laboratory tests with low spatiotemporal resolution. To better understand brain pathology, it is essential to detect functional abnormalities of brain over time. To this end, we investigated characteristic patterns of altered neuronal integrity and functional correlation between various regions in mice brains injected with bacterial lipopeptides using PET with a goal to apply new findings to diagnosis of brain disorder specific to bacterial infection. In addition, we analyzed altered synaptic density and function using both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experimental models to understand how bacterial lipopeptides impair brain function and network.</p>

<p>The ability of stress to trigger cocaine seeking in humans and rodents is variable and is determined by the amount and pattern of prior drug use. This study examined the role of a corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-regulated dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the prelimbic cortex in shock-induced cocaine seeking and its recruitment under self-administration conditions that establish relapse vulnerability. Male rats with a history of daily long-access (LgA; 14 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 6 h/d) but not short-access (ShA; 14 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 2 h/d) self-administration showed robust shock-induced cocaine seeking. This was associated with a heightened shock-induced prelimbic cortex Fos response and activation of cholera toxin b retro-labeled VTA neurons that project to the prelimbic cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway using a dual virus intersectional hM4Di DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) based approach prevented shock-induced cocaine seeking. Both shock-induced reinstatement and the prelimbic cortex Fos response were prevented by bilateral intra-VTA injections of the CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) antagonist, antalarmin. Moreover, pharmacological disconnection of the CRF-regulated dopaminergic projection to the prelimbic cortex by injection of antalarmin into the VTA in one hemisphere and the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, into the prelimbic cortex of the contralateral hemisphere prevented shock-induced cocaine seeking. Finally, LgA, but not ShA, cocaine self-administration resulted in increased VTA CRFR1 mRNA levels as measured using <i>in situ</i> hybridization. Altogether, these findings suggest that excessive cocaine use may establish susceptibility to stress-induced relapse by recruiting CRF regulation of a stressor-responsive mesocortical dopaminergic pathway.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the neural pathways and mechanisms through which stress triggers relapse to cocaine use is critical for the development of more effective treatment approaches. Prior work has demonstrated a critical role for the neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in stress-induced cocaine seeking. Here we provide evidence that stress-induced reinstatement in a rat model of relapse is mediated by a CRF-regulated dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that activates dopamine D1 receptors in the prelimbic cortex. Moreover, we report that this pathway may be recruited as a result of daily cocaine self-administration under conditions of extended drug access/heightened drug intake, likely as a result of increased CRFR1 expression in the VTA, thereby promoting susceptibility to stress-induced cocaine seeking.</p>

<p>A restricted lesion of the hand area in the primary motor cortex (M1) leads to a deficit of contralesional manual dexterity, followed by an incomplete functional recovery, accompanied by plastic changes in M1 itself and in other cortical areas on both hemispheres. Using the marker SMI-32 specific to pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III and V, we investigated the impact of a focal unilateral M1 lesion (hand representation) on the rostral part (F6) and caudal part (F3) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in both hemispheres in nine adult macaque monkeys compared with four intact control monkeys. The M1 lesion induced a consistent interhemispheric asymmetry in density of SMI-32-positive neurons in F3 layer V (statistically significant in 8 of 9 lesioned monkeys), highly correlated with the lesion volume and with the duration of functional recovery, but not with the extent of functional recovery itself. Such interhemispheric asymmetry was neither present in the intact monkeys, as expected, nor in F6 in all monkeys. In addition, the M1 lesion also impacted on the basal dendritic arborization of F3 layer V neurons. Neuronal density was clearly less affected by the M1 lesion in F3 layer III compared with layer V. We interpret the remote effect of M1 lesion onto the density of SMI-32-positive neurons and dendritic arborization in the SMAs bilaterally as the consequence of multiple factors, such as changes of connectivity, diaschisis and various mechanisms involved in cortical plasticity underlying the functional recovery from the M1 lesion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The motor system of macaque monkeys, in addition to be similarly organized as in humans, is a good candidate to study the impact of a focal lesion of the main contributor to voluntary movements, the primary motor cortex (M1), on non-primary motor cortical areas also involved in manual dexterity, both at behavioral and structural levels. Our results show that a unilateral permanent lesion of M1 hand area in nine monkeys affects the interhemispheric balance of the number of SMI-32-positive pyramidal neurons in the cortical layer V of the supplementary motor area, in a way strongly correlated to the lesion volume and duration of the incomplete functional recovery.</p>

<p>The animal circadian timing system interprets environmental time cues and internal metabolic status to orchestrate circadian rhythms of physiology, allowing animals to perform necessary tasks in a time-of-day-dependent manner. Normal progression of circadian rhythms is dependent on the daily cycling of core transcriptional factors that make up cell-autonomous molecular oscillators. In <i>Drosophila</i>, PERIOD (PER), TIMELESS (TIM), CLOCK (CLK), and CYCLE (CYC) are core clock proteins that function in a transcriptional–translational feedback mechanism to regulate the circadian transcriptome. Posttranslational modifications of core clock proteins provide precise temporal control over when they are active as regulators of clock-controlled genes. In particular, phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism that dictates the subcellular localization, stability, and transcriptional activity of clock proteins. Previously, casein kinase 1α (CK1α) has been identified as a kinase that phosphorylates mammalian PER1 and modulates its stability, but the mechanisms by which it modulates PER protein stability is still unclear. Using <i>Drosophila</i> as a model, we show that CK1α has an overall function of speeding up PER metabolism and is required to maintain the 24 h period of circadian rhythms. Our results indicate that CK1α collaborates with the key clock kinase DOUBLETIME (DBT) in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to regulate the timing of PER-dependent repression of the circadian transcriptome. Specifically, we observe that CK1α promotes PER nuclear localization by antagonizing the activity of DBT to inhibit PER nuclear translocation. Furthermore, CK1α enhances DBT-dependent PER phosphorylation and degradation once PER moves into the nucleus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian clocks are endogenous timers that integrate environmental signals to impose temporal control over organismal physiology over the 24 h day/night cycle. To maintain the 24 h period length of circadian clocks and to ensure that circadian rhythms are in synchrony with the external environment, key proteins that make up the molecular oscillator are extensively regulated by phosphorylation to ensure that they perform proper time-of-day-specific functions. Casein kinase 1α (CK1α) has previously been identified as a kinase that phosphorylates mammalian PERIOD (PER) proteins to promote their degradation, but the mechanism by which it modulates PER stability is unclear. In this study, we characterize the mechanisms by which CK1α interacts with DOUBLETIME (DBT) to achieve the overall function of speeding up PER metabolism and to ensure proper time-keeping.</p>

<p>Nonhuman primates have proven to be a valuable animal model for exploring neuronal mechanisms of cognitive control. One important aspect of executive control is the ability to switch from one task to another, and task-switching paradigms have often been used in human volunteers to uncover the underlying neuronal processes. To date, however, no study has investigated task-switching paradigms in nonhuman primates during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We trained two rhesus macaques to switch between arm movement, eye movement, and passive fixation tasks during fMRI. Similar to results obtained in human volunteers, task switching elicits increased fMRI activations in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Our results indicate that the macaque monkey is a reliable model with which to investigate higher-order cognitive functioning such as task switching. As such, these results can pave the way for a detailed investigation of the neural basis of complex human behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Task switching is an important aspect of cognitive control, and task-switching paradigms have often been used to investigate higher-order executive functioning in human volunteers. We used a task-switching paradigm in the nonhuman primate during fMRI and found increased activation mainly in prefrontal areas (46, 45, frontal eye field, and anterior cingulate), in orbitofrontal area 12, and in the caudate nucleus. These data fit surprisingly well with previous human imaging data, proving that the monkey is an excellent model to study task switching with high spatiotemporal resolution tools that are currently not applicable in humans. As such, our results pave the way for a detailed interrogation of regions performing similar executive functions in humans and monkeys.</p>

<p>Aberrant hippocampal activity is observed in individuals with schizophrenia and is thought to underlie the augmented dopamine system function associated with psychosis. The pathway by which the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) regulates dopamine neuron activity has been demonstrated previously and involves a glutamatergic projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Recent postmortem studies have confirmed glutamatergic abnormalities in the NAc of individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically, an increase in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) expression was reported. Although projections from the hippocampus do express vGlut2, inputs from the thalamus are more likely to account for this alteration; however, the role of thalamic inputs to the NAc in the regulation of dopamine neuron activity has not been elucidated. Here, using male Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrate that a subset of NAc medium spiny neurons receive convergent inputs from the vHipp and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), with both regions working synergistically to regulate dopamine neuron activity. Activation of either the vHipp or PVT increases the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Moreover, this regulation requires simultaneous activity in both regions because PVT inactivation can reverse vHipp-induced increases in dopamine neuron population activity and vHipp inactivation can reverse PVT-induced increases. This is relevant to schizophrenia because inactivation of either the vHipp or PVT is sufficient to reverse aberrant dopamine system function in two distinct rodent models. These data suggest that thalamic abnormalities may contribute to the aberrant dopamine system function observed in schizophrenia and that the PVT represents a novel site of intervention for psychosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Current treatments for schizophrenia are far from adequate and a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology underlying this disease is warranted if we are to discover novel therapeutic targets. We have previously demonstrated that the aberrant dopamine system function observed in individuals with schizophrenia and rodent models is driven by increases in hippocampal activity. We now demonstrate that thalamic (paraventricular nucleus, PVT) and ventral hippocampal afferents converge in the nucleus accumbens to regulate dopamine system function. Such information provides a potential site for therapeutic intervention for schizophrenia. Indeed, inactivation of the PVT can effectively reverse aberrant dopamine system function in two distinct rodent models displaying circuit level alterations and corresponding behavioral deficits relevant to schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of tau protein are a neuropathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). For some time NFTs were considered the primary cause of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, however, more recent evidence suggests that soluble aggregates of tau are key drivers of disease. Here we investigated the effect of different tau species on synaptic plasticity in the male rat hippocampus <i>in vivo</i>. Intracerebroventricular injection of soluble aggregates formed from either wild-type or P301S human recombinant tau potently inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-to-CA1 synapses. In contrast, tau monomers and fibrils appeared inactive. Neither baseline synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation nor burst response during high-frequency conditioning stimulation was affected by the soluble tau aggregates. Similarly, certain AD brain soluble extracts inhibited LTP in a tau-dependent manner that was abrogated by either immunodepletion with, or coinjection of, a mid-region anti-tau monoclonal antibody (mAb), Tau5. Importantly, this tau-mediated block of LTP was prevented by administration of mAbs selective for the prion protein (PrP). Specifically, mAbs to both the mid-region (6D11) and N-terminus (MI-0131) of PrP prevented inhibition of LTP by both recombinant and brain-derived tau. These findings indicate that PrP is a mediator of tau-induced synaptic dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we report that certain soluble forms of tau selectively disrupt synaptic plasticity in the live rat hippocampus. Further, we show that monoclonal antibodies to cellular prion protein abrogate the impairment of long-term potentiation caused both by recombinant and Alzheimer's disease brain-derived soluble tau. These findings support a critical role for cellular prion protein in the deleterious synaptic actions of extracellular soluble tau in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. Thus, approaches targeting cellular prion protein, or downstream pathways, might provide an effective strategy for developing therapeutics.</p>

<p>by Wen Zhang, Xiang Yue, Guifeng Tang, Wenjian Wu, Feng Huang, Xining Zhang</p>

LncRNA-protein interactions play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. Identification of lncRNA-protein interactions helps to understand lncRNA-related activities. Existing computational methods utilize multiple lncRNA features or multiple protein features to predict lncRNA-protein interactions, but features are not available for all lncRNAs or proteins; most of existing methods are not capable of predicting interacting proteins (or lncRNAs) for new lncRNAs (or proteins), which don’t have known interactions. In this paper, we propose the sequence-based feature projection ensemble learning method, “SFPEL-LPI”, to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. First, SFPEL-LPI extracts lncRNA sequence-based features and protein sequence-based features. Second, SFPEL-LPI calculates multiple lncRNA-lncRNA similarities and protein-protein similarities by using lncRNA sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein interactions. Then, SFPEL-LPI combines multiple similarities and multiple features with a feature projection ensemble learning frame. In computational experiments, SFPEL-LPI accurately predicts lncRNA-protein associations and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, SFPEL-LPI can be applied to new lncRNAs (or proteins). The case studies demonstrate that our method can find out novel lncRNA-protein interactions, which are confirmed by literature. Finally, we construct a user-friendly web server, available at http://www.bioinfotech.cn/SFPEL-LPI/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0iga8hXGIQ" width="1" />

<p>by Ning Zhang, Yuting Chen, Feiyang Zhao, Qing Yang, Franco L. Simonetti, Minghui Li</p>

Protein-DNA interactions play important roles in regulations of many vital cellular processes, including transcription, translation, DNA replication and recombination. Sequence variants occurring in these DNA binding proteins that alter protein-DNA interactions may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of function, potentially leading to diseases. Developing a mechanistic understanding of impacts of variants on protein-DNA interactions becomes a persistent need. To address this need we introduce a new computational method PremPDI that predicts the effect of single missense mutation in the protein on the protein-DNA interaction and calculates the quantitative binding affinity change. The PremPDI method is based on molecular mechanics force fields and fast side-chain optimization algorithms with parameters optimized on experimental sets of 219 mutations from 49 protein-DNA complexes. PremPDI yields a very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and root-mean-square error of 0.86 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. The PremPDI server could map mutations on a structural protein-DNA complex, calculate the associated changes in binding affinity, determine the deleterious effect of a mutation, and produce a mutant structural model for download. PremPDI can be applied to many tasks, such as determination of potential damaging mutations in cancer and other diseases. PremPDI is available at http://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPDI/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uoKVqoewtV8" width="1" />

Elazar et al. demonstrate that myelination requires regulated adhesive interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons. They show that excessive axoglial contact results in mistargeting of oligodendrocytes to neuronal somata and their inability to form elongated myelin around axons.

Memory exists across different time scales. Long-term memories can last a lifetime, while working memory persists for mere seconds. In between, memories that are newly formed—or recently recalled—are more vivid than latent ones. How does this happen? The act of memory recall increases the excitability of whole engram cells for about one hour. This short-term increase of engram cell excitability facilitates synaptic access to memory content in response to relevant environmental cues.

<p>by Aleksandr V. Zhuravlev, Oleg V. Vetrovoy, Elena V. Savvateeva-Popova</p>

Kynurenines, the products of tryptophan oxidative degradation, are involved in multiple neuropathologies, such as Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, senile dementia, etc. The major cause for hydroxykynurenines's neurotoxicity is the oxidative stress induced by the reactive oxygen species (ROS), the by-products of L-3-hydroxykynurenine (L-3HOK) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) oxidative self-dimerization. 2-aminophenol (2AP), a structural precursor of L-3HOK and 3HAA, undergoes the oxidative conjugation to form 2-aminophenoxazinone. There are several modes of 2AP dimerization, including both enzymatic and non-enzymatic stages. In this study, the free energies for 2AP, L-3HOK and 3HAA dimerization stages have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)//6-311+(O)+G(d) level, both in the gas phase and in heptane or water solution. For the intermediates, ionization potentials and electron affinities were calculated, as well as free energy and kinetics of molecular oxygen interaction with several non-enzymatically formed dimers. H-atom donating power of the intermediates increases upon the progress of the oxidation, making possible generation of hydroperoxyl radical or hydrogen peroxide from O<sub>2</sub> at the last stages. Among the dimerization intermediates, 2-aminophenoxazinole derivatives have the lowest ionization potential and can reduce O<sub>2</sub> to superoxide anion. The rate for O-H homolytic bond dissociation is significantly higher than that for C-H bond in non-enzymatic quinoneimine conjugate. However, the last reaction passes irreversibly, reducing O<sub>2</sub> to hydroperoxyl radical. The inorganic ferrous iron and the heme group of Drosophila phenoxazinone synthase significantly reduce the energy cost of 2AP H-atom abstraction by O<sub>2</sub>. We have also shown experimentally that total antioxidant capacity decreases in Drosophila mutant <i>cardinal</i> with L-3HOK excess relative to the wild type <i>Canton-S</i>, and lipid peroxidation decreases in aged <i>cardinal</i>. Taken together, our data supports the conception of hydroxykynurenines' dual role in neurotoxicity: serving as antioxidants themselves, blocking lipid peroxidation by H-atom donation, they also can easily generate ROS upon dimerization, leading to the oxidative stress development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C-7ALSyceJw" width="1" />

<p>by Jordan C. Rozum, Réka Albert</p>

We present a technique applicable in any dynamical framework to identify control-robust subsets of an interacting system. These robust subsystems, which we call stable modules, are characterized by constraints on the variables that make up the subsystem. They are robust in the sense that if the defining constraints are satisfied at a given time, they remain satisfied for all later times, regardless of what happens in the rest of the system, and can only be broken if the constrained variables are externally manipulated. We identify stable modules as graph structures in an <i>expanded network</i>, which represents causal links between variable constraints. A stable module represents a system “decision point”, or trap subspace. Using the expanded network, small stable modules can be composed sequentially to form larger stable modules that describe dynamics on the system level. Collections of large, mutually exclusive stable modules describe the system’s repertoire of long-term behaviors. We implement this technique in a broad class of dynamical systems and illustrate its practical utility via examples and algorithmic analysis of two published biological network models. In the segment polarity gene network of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we obtain a state-space visualization that reproduces by novel means the four possible cell fates and predicts the outcome of cell transplant experiments. In the T-cell signaling network, we identify six signaling elements that determine the high-signal response and show that control of an element connected to them cannot disrupt this response.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WHPTZKaeRs0" width="1" />

<p>by Isao T. Tokuda, Daisuke Ono, Sato Honma, Ken-Ichi Honma, Hanspeter Herzel</p>

Circadian clocks are autonomous oscillators driving daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In mammals, a network of coupled neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained to environmental light-dark cycles and orchestrates the timing of peripheral organs. In each neuron, transcriptional feedbacks generate noisy oscillations. Coupling mediated by neuropeptides such as VIP and AVP lends precision and robustness to circadian rhythms. The detailed coupling mechanisms between SCN neurons are debated. We analyze organotypic SCN slices from neonatal and adult mice in wild-type and multiple knockout conditions. Different degrees of rhythmicity are quantified by pixel-level analysis of bioluminescence data. We use empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to characterize spatio-temporal patterns. Simulations of coupled stochastic single cell oscillators can reproduce the diversity of observed patterns. Our combination of data analysis and modeling provides deeper insight into the enormous complexity of the data: (1) Neonatal slices are typically stronger oscillators than adult slices pointing to developmental changes of coupling. (2) Wild-type slices are completely synchronized and exhibit specific spatio-temporal patterns of phases. (3) Some slices of Cry double knockouts obey impaired synchrony that can lead to co–existing rhythms (“splitting”). (4) The loss of VIP-coupling leads to desynchronized rhythms with few residual local clusters. Additional information was extracted from co–culturing slices with rhythmic neonatal wild-type SCNs. These co–culturing experiments were simulated using external forcing terms representing VIP and AVP signaling. The rescue of rhythmicity via co–culturing lead to surprising results, since a cocktail of AVP-antagonists improved synchrony. Our modeling suggests that these counter-intuitive observations are pointing to an antagonistic action of VIP and AVP coupling. Our systematic theoretical and experimental study shows that dual coupling mechanisms can explain the astonishing complexity of spatio-temporal patterns in SCN slices.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bzOW4DkCwVs" width="1" />

<p>by Ho Ka Chan, Fabian Hersperger, Emiliano Marachlian, Brian H. Smith, Fernando Locatelli, Paul Szyszka, Thomas Nowotny</p>

In natural environments, odors are typically mixtures of several different chemical compounds. However, the implications of mixtures for odor processing have not been fully investigated. We have extended a standard olfactory receptor model to mixtures and found through its mathematical analysis that odorant-evoked activity patterns are more stable across concentrations and first-spike latencies of receptor neurons are shorter for mixtures than for pure odorants. Shorter first-spike latencies arise from the nonlinear dependence of binding rate on odorant concentration, commonly described by the Hill coefficient, while the more stable activity patterns result from the competition between different ligands for receptor sites. These results are consistent with observations from numerical simulations and physiological recordings in the olfactory system of insects. Our results suggest that mixtures allow faster and more reliable olfactory coding, which could be one of the reasons why animals often use mixtures in chemical signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uT4ayB9vUj8" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: April 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 55</p><p>Author(s): Eric Schulz, Samuel J. Gershman</p><div><p>Balancing exploration and exploitation is one of the central problems in reinforcement learning. We review recent studies that have identified multiple algorithmic strategies underlying exploration. In particular, humans use a combination of random and uncertainty-directed exploration strategies, which rely on different brain systems, have different developmental trajectories, and are sensitive to different task manipulations. Humans are also able to exploit sophisticated structural knowledge to aid their exploration, such as information about correlations between options. New computational models, drawing inspiration from machine learning, have begun to formalize these ideas and offer new ways to understand the neural basis of reinforcement learning.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Eran A Mukamel, John Ngai</p><div><p>The diversity of brain cell types was one of the earliest observations in modern neuroscience and continues to be one of the central concerns of current neuroscience research. Despite impressive recent progress, including single cell transcriptome and epigenome profiling as well as anatomical methods, we still lack a complete census or taxonomy of brain cell types. We argue this is due partly to the conceptual difficulty in defining a cell type. By considering the biological drivers of cell identity, such as networks of genes and gene regulatory elements, we propose a definition of cell type that emphasizes self-stabilizing regulation. We explore the predictions and hypotheses that arise from this definition. Integration of data from multiple modalities, including molecular profiling of genes and gene products, epigenetic landscape, cellular morphology, connectivity, and physiology, will be essential for a meaningful and broadly useful definition of brain cell types.</p></div>

Several recent reviews have comprehensively discussed the molecular and functional diversity of mammalian astrocytes. In this brief review, we emphasize interspecies comparisons and an evolutionary perspective regarding the astro(glia) of vertebrates and invertebrates which are similar in form and function. This analysis has revealed conserved astrocyte transcriptomes in the fly, mouse and human. We also offer opinions about the pattern and origin of astrocyte heterogeneity in the CNS.</p></div>

Passecker et al. show that specialized neurons in the prelimbic cortex of rats predict the next choice during the outcome evaluation in a gambling task, even for unlikely or uncertain decisions. Disrupting the prelimbic cortex led to excessive risk taking.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Jesse M Gray, Ivo Spiegel</p><div><p>Experience leaves a lasting mark on neural circuit function in part through activity-regulated gene (ARG) expression. New genome wide approaches have revealed that ARG programs are highly cell-type-specific, raising the possibility that they mediate different forms of experience-dependent plasticity in different cell types. The cell-type specificity of these gene programs is achieved by a combination of cell-intrinsic mechanisms that determine the transcriptional response of each neuronal subtype to a given stimulus and by cell-extrinsic mechanisms that influence the nature of the stimulus a cell receives. A better understanding of these mechanisms could usher in an era of molecular systems neuroscience in which genetic perturbations of cell-type-specific plasticities are assessed using electrophysiology and <em>in vivo</em> imaging to reveal the neural basis of adaptive behaviors.</p></div>
