              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two types of locus coeruleus norepinephrine neurons drive reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex generates flexible behavior by learning. Reinforcement learning is thought to be driven by error signals in midbrain dopamine neurons. However, they project more densely to basal ganglia than cortex, leaving open the possibility of another source of learning signals for cortex. The locus coeruleus (LC) contains most of the brain's norepinephrine (NE) neurons and project broadly to cortex. We measured activity from identified mouse LC-NE neurons during a behavioral task requiring ongoing learning from reward prediction errors (RPEs). We found two types of LC-NE neurons: neurons with wide action potentials (type I) were excited by positive RPE and showed an increasing relationship with change of choice likelihood. Neurons with thin action potentials (type II) were excited by lack of reward and showed a decreasing relationship with change of choice likelihood. Silencing LC-NE neurons changed future choices, as predicted from the electrophysiological recordings and a model of how RPEs are used to guide learning. We reveal functional heterogeneity of a neuromodulatory system in the brain and show that NE inputs to cortex act as a quantitative learning signal for flexible behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous activation of cortical somatosensory networks depresses their excitability in preterm human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The activity of the developing cortex is characteristically discontinuous where sudden high amplitude bursts interrupt periods of quiescent background. While the functional importance of this activity is clear, its aetiology is not known. Here, we hypothesise that this alternating pattern arises because of 'refractoriness' of cortical networks following spontaneous activation. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether spontaneous activity in sensory networks depressed their excitability by measuring the impact of ongoing activity on the response to an external sensory stimulus. We recorded cortical activity before and after mechanical tactile stimulation of hands and feet in 35 preterm infants of median 32 weeks post-menstrual age. Results: Mechanical stimulation evoked wideband energy increases with two distinct peaks within the delta and alpha-beta band. The delta activity engaged extended cortical areas, while the faster activity engaged local somatotopically specific areas. By then characterising the spectro-spatial properties of the spontaneous activity preceding stimulation, we showed that baseline energy with a distribution and spectral profile similar to that of somatosensory-evoked activity dampened the energy changes elicited by touching the body. Discussion: Sensory-evoked activity in preterm human neonates likely represents the coordinated activation of extended (tangential) and local (e.g. columnar) cortical aggregates. The occurrence of spontaneous cortical events in the same cortical regions depresses their excitability preventing their immediate re-engagement. This 'refractoriness' offers the first etiological explanation to the cyclical burst-quiescence pattern typical of preterm cortical activity.

	<p>Depression and alcohol misuse, frequently comorbid, are associated with altered reward processing. However, no study has examined whether and how the neural markers of reward processing are shared between depression and alcohol misuse. We studied 43 otherwise-healthy drinking adults in a monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) during fMRI. All participants were evaluated with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Beck&amp;amp;rsquo;s Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess the severity of drinking and depression. We performed whole brain regressions against each AUDIT and BDI-II score to investigate the neural correlates and evaluated the findings at a corrected threshold. We performed mediation analyses to examine the inter-relationships between win/loss responses, alcohol misuse, and depression. AUDIT and BDI-II scores were positively correlated across subjects. Alcohol misuse and depression shared win-related activations in frontoparietal regions and parahippocampal gyri (PHG), and right superior temporal gyri (STG), as well as loss-related activations in the right PHG and STG, and midline cerebellum. These regional activities (&amp;amp;beta;&amp;amp;rsquo;s) completely mediated the correlations between BDI-II and AUDIT scores. The findings suggest shared neural correlates interlinking depression and problem drinking both during win and loss processing and provide evidence for co-morbid etiological processes of depressive and alcohol use disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in frailty and its associated factors in the community dwelling elderly Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective analytical study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is a scarcity of quality literature on the prevalence of frailty among community dwelling elderly in India. This study was originally planned to analyze the longitudinal trends in frailty status of community dwelling elderly in an Indian population as well to identify factors associated with frailty in the Indian context. However, the recruitment phase of this study coincided with one of the largest lockdowns in history, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and this gave us a unique opportunity to study the effects this pandemic enforced, as a result of the necessary restrictions, on the frailty status as well the factors affecting frailty in the elderly. Methods: A prospective observational study was designed and conducted amongst 19 community dwelling elderly of Dakshina Kannada District, in Karnataka India. Outcome variables of frailty (EFIP), physical activity (PASE), functional mobility (TUG), gait speed (10-meter walk test), nutritional status (MNA®-SF) body composition (BIA), and strength (dynamometry), were measured at baseline and on follow-up after three months. The changes occurring in these variables over the three-month period were analyzed and the change in frailty was independently correlated with changes in each of the other outcomes. Results: We couldn’t identify any statistically significant difference in frailty over a period of three months. However, there was a highly significant change in the physical activity status, lower extremity muscle strength, body composition, functional mobility, gait speed, and cognitive function in the same time period. Conclusions: Though individual determinants of frailty in community dwelling changed over a three-month period, these changes failed to produce any observable/measurable difference in frailty status.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling time-varying volatility using GARCH models: evidence from the Indian stock market [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this study, we examined the volatility of the Indian stock market from 2008 to 2021. Owing to the financial crisis, volatility forecasting of the Indian stock market has become crucial for economic and financial analysts. An empirical study of the returns of the NSE indices revealed an autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic trend in the Indian stock market. Methods: Using GARCH 1, 1 (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) and FIGARCH (fractionally integrated GARCH), we examine investor behaviour and the persistence of long-term volatility. Results: The empirical findings of the estimated models suggest that shocks persist for a long time in NSE returns. Furthermore, bad news has a greater impact on stock volatility than good news. The return on assets is stable but highly volatile, even though the Indian economy has experienced the global crash to some extent. Conclusions: Models of volatility derived from the GARCH equation provide accurate forecasts and are useful for portfolio allocation, performance measurement, and option valuation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Carotenoids from female Grapsus albolineatus as potential anti-ageing compounds [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Grapsus albolineatus is thought to have a high concentration of carotenoid pigments. Although studies on male G. albolineatus have been conducted, no studies on pigment extraction from female G. albolineatus have been carried out. Carotenoids have a high ability to fight free radicals. Previous research has shown that carotenoids can fight free radicals that cause premature skin-aging. The purpose of this research was to find out what kinds of carotenoids are found in G. albolineatus and whether they can act as natural inhibitors of proteins that cause premature aging, such as glucogenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase enzymes. Methods: Carotenoids were extracted from G. albolineatus using column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); molecular docking and visualization were done with Autodock 4.2 and Discovery Studio/Biovia, respectively.   Results: According to HPLC data, there are carotenoid pigments such as didehydroastaxanthin, tetrahydroastaxanthin, dihydroastaxanthin, diatoxanthin, astaxanthin, and adonixanthin.  According to molecular docking experiments, pigment carotenoids from G. albolineatus are efficient inhibitors of protein elastase and hyaluronidase. Conclusions: G. albolineatus carotenoids have the potential to be anti-aging since they are more effective as protein elastase and hyaluronidase inhibitors than their native inhibitors.

A convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. An online Rao soft sample size calculator was applied to determine the sample size of 319. The response rate of participants was expected to be 63%, the margin of error was 5% and the level of confidence was 95%.     Results: A total of 248 parents (89.1% mothers (n =203)) and 15.7% fathers (n=39) with a mean ± SD age of 35.4 ± 7.04 years, completed the study (77.7% response rate). Parents reported that the supplements used the most by children were vitamin D supplements (21.85%) and multivitamins (21.8%) followed by calcium supplements (5.6%). However, 27.8% of children in this study did not take any supplements. Of all the parents, 65% (162) of them reported sending their child outside to play while 34.67% (86) of parents had reported no outdoor activity. Approximately 184 (74.2%) parents reported the child’s diet to contain multiple natural sources of vitamin D. However, 69 (27.8%) parents reported giving none of the natural sources of vitamin D to their children through the diet. Parents with higher education about 62.9% (n=156) had a higher frequency of providing vitamin D supplements to their children. Children in high-income families (43.63%) were more likely to take vitamin D supplements than those in middle- or low-income families.     Conclusion: The study concluded that challenges like the educational and financial background of parents, family-income level, and health insurance status could help aid in addressing the overall burden of vitamin D deficiency among young children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese international student-athletes’ adjustment experience at the National Collegiate Athletic Association [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Currently, the number of International-Student Athletes (ISAs) in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is increasing over time and Japan is the biggest market for recruiting in Asia. Whereas international students are playing an increasingly important role in the NCAA, several studies have reported that ISAs face challenges in adjusting to their dual identities as students and athletes at universities in the US. Furthermore, it has been cleared Asian students studying at US universities have some challenges because of cultural and linguistic differences. However, it remains unclear whether the difficulties experienced by Japanese ISAs are the same as or different to the adjustment-related challenges experienced by other ISAs or Asian students. The purpose of this study is to clarify challenges for ISAs from Japan in adjusting to the United States’ universities. Situating in the ISA adjustment model and using a unique case study design, 13 Japanese ISAs at the NCAA Division I universities were interviewed, and data were coded by a continuous comparative analysis method. The results revealed that Japanese ISAs who participated in this study faced academic, social, athletic, personal-emotional, and institutional adjustment challenges. Particularly, Japanese ISAs differed from ISAs from other countries in several points; cultural differences, differences in communication styles, and systemic differences in academia and athletics between Japan and the US. For promoting adjustment of Japanese ISAs, this study suggests; gaining experience and getting information to understand and familiarize with the differences, building relationships with linguistic and culturally diverse people to understand various cultures, encouraging universities and coaches to understand specific difficulties for Japanese ISAs.

                Background: The purpose of this study was to obtain data on the prevalence of specialist doctors and Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ORL-HNS) residents in Indonesia who suffered from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after receiving the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination using the Sinovac vaccine (CoronaVac) and the length of time infected with COVID-19 after the second Sinovac vaccination. Methods: We performed a descriptive observational study, using a cross-sectional design. Data collection took place between August 2021 and October 2021. The respondents in this study included specialist doctors and ORL-HNS residents who worked in various hospitals in Indonesia who had received the second dose of the Sinovac vaccination. Data collection was performed by means of Self-reporting Online Survey Platform (Google Form). Results: This study included 1,530 respondents, and 54.2% of respondents were women. Respondents consisted of 68.6% ORL-HNS doctors and the rest were residents with an average age of 41.46 years old. The distance between the first and second doses of Sinovac was mostly under one month, which was 71.3% of the respondents. A total of 76.3% of respondents did not have co-morbid diseases. Based on this study, 16.9% of respondents suffered from COVID-19 after the second dose of Sinovac vaccination. The length of time suffering from COVID-19 after the second Sinovac vaccination was 3-6 months (9.7%). Conclusions: Based on this study, 16.9% of respondents suffered from COVID-19 after receiving the second Sinovac vaccination and 9.7% suffered from COVID-19 after 3-6 months of Sinovac vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular docking, ADMET profiling of gallic acid and its derivatives (N-alkyl gallamide) as an anti-breast cancer agent [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In 2020, breast cancer has become the most common cancer in the world and in Indonesia. Searching for anticancer drugs using computational methods is considered more effective and selective than other methods. Gallic acid and its derivatives (esters and amides) are compounds that have biological activities such as anticancer effects. The purpose of this study was to analyse the molecular modelling and ADMET (Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) profile of gallic acid derivative compounds (N-alkyl gallamides) as anticancer agents. Methods Target proteins were selected by analysis of protein-protein and drug-protein interactions. Molecular modelling was done by molecular docking. Predictive analysis of the ADMET profile of gallic acid and its derivatives (N-alkyl gallamide) was conducted using Marvin Sketch, Swissadme, protox II, and pkCSM pharmacokinetics. The selected target proteins were JUN, AKT1, CASP3, and CASP7. Results Compounds N-octyl gallamide, N-ters-butyl gallamide, and N-isoamil gallamide were the three best gallic acid derivatives based on molecular modelling analysis of target proteins associated with breast cancer. The ADMET profile of the N-alkyl gallamide compound is predictable and shows a good profile as a candidate for anticancer drugs. Conclusion N-octyl gallamide, N-ters-butyl gallamide, and N-isoamil gallamide have potential as anti-breast cancer agents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Removal of reinforcement improves instrumental performance in humans by decreasing a general action bias rather than unmasking learnt associations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah Kurtenbach, Eduard Ort, Monja Isabel Froböse, Gerhard Jocham</p>

Performance during instrumental learning is commonly believed to reflect the knowledge that has been acquired up to that point. However, recent work in rodents found that instrumental performance was enhanced during periods when reinforcement was withheld, relative to periods when reinforcement was provided. This suggests that reinforcement may mask acquired knowledge and lead to impaired performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such a beneficial effect of removing reinforcement translates to humans. Specifically, we tested whether performance during learning was improved during non-reinforced relative to reinforced task periods using signal detection theory and a computational modelling approach. To this end, 60 healthy volunteers performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement. To probe acquired knowledge in the absence of reinforcement, we interspersed blocks without feedback. In these non-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased <i>d’</i>, indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. However, computational modelling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learnt values, but to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias. Together with an initial tendency to act, this is sufficient to drive differential changes in hit and false alarm rates that jointly lead to an increased <i>d’</i>. To conclude, the improved instrumental performance in the absence of reinforcement observed in studies using asymmetrically reinforced go/no-go tasks may reflect a change in response bias rather than unmasking latent knowledge.

Drug discovery for psychiatric conditions is stagnating. Behavioral changes could be used as a primary phenotypic screen for new drug candidates, if enough useful data can be generated from behavioral models. Could machine learning be the answer to extracting the data we need?

Behavioral changes could be used as a primary phenotypic screen for new drug candidates for psychiatric conditions, if enough useful data can be generated from current behavioral models. In this Perspective, the authors advocate for using machine learning to extract the data we need.

                Background: Medicinal plants are potential resources for isolating drug candidates. Various plants have been reported to possess pharmacological effects including anti-hepatitis C activities. The current study examined the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activities of Acacia mangium extracts in solvents with various polarities and further evaluated the mechanism of action of the extracts using Western blotting and combination treatment models. Methods: The leaves of A. mangium were extracted in two phases, first in ethanol and then in solvents with different polarities (n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol). HCV-infected Huh7it-1 cells were treated with the extracts at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 µg/mL. Results: The results revealed the strong anti-HCV activities of the extracts. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50s) of the ethanol, n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extracts were of 4.6 ± 0.3, 2.9 ± 0.2, 0.2 ± 0.3, and 2.8 ± 0.2 μg/mL, respectively, and no cytotoxic effect was detected. These extracts displayed stronger effects than the positive control ribavirin. The mode of action of the ethanol extract was evaluated at 30 µg/mL, revealing that the inhibitory effect was stronger on the post-entry step than on the entry step. Western blotting revealed that the extracts decreased NS3 protein expression, indicating that virus replication was suppressed. Further evaluation illustrated that combined treatment with the ethanol extract enhanced the anti-viral activity of simeprevir. Conclusions: These results indicated that A. mangium leaves could represent sources of anti-HCV agents.

                Background: Spindle cell lipoma (SCL) is an uncommon subtype of lipomas. It usually occurs in the posterior side of the trunk such as neck, back and shoulders and rarely touches the extremities. Only four cases of SCL of the knee and no cases of SCL of the popliteal fossa have been reported in the literature. We present herein the largest case of SCL of the popliteal fossa and knee to our knowledge. Case presentation: A 75-year-old woman presented with a slow growing swelling of the left knee. Physical examination showed a 12 cm well-limited painless mass of the left popliteal fossa. The mass was pediculated with a central ulceration. MRI scan showed a tumoral mass of the left popliteal fossa with some non-dilated vessels draining to the long saphenous vein. The mass had no evidence of invasion of the underlying tissues. The patient underwent a surgical resection of the mass with postoperative recovery. The histological examination revealed a tumoral proliferation diffusely expressing CD34 without malignancy evidence, and a Ki67 proliferation index <1%. This morphological and immunohistochemical aspect is typical of a SCL. Clinical discussion: SCL is a rare histological variant of lipoma occurring mostly in the posterior side of the upper trunk. SCL of the knee or the popliteal fossa are exceptional. Clinically, it presents as a gradually increasing painless mass with a long evolving history. Histologically, these tumors are made of spindle-shaped cells, rope-like collagen fibers and mature adipocytes surrounded by a fibrous capsule. Immunohistologically, spindle cell lipomas usually show diffuse and strong expression of CD34, and to a lesser degree vimentin. The optimal treatment of SCL is a surgical marginal resection. Conclusions: SCL represents an infrequent subtype, and its atypical presentation should push clinicians to further investigations in order to rule out more worrisome malignancies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gallbladder adenocarcinomas undergo subclonal diversification and selection from precancerous lesions to metastatic tumors</a></h4>

              
                We aimed to elucidate the evolutionary trajectories of gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBAC) using multi-regional and longitudinal tumor samples. Using whole-exome sequencing data, we constructed phylogenetic trees in each patient and analyzed mutational signatures. A total of 11 patients including 2 rapid autopsy cases were enrolled. The most frequently altered gene in primary tumors was <i>ERBB2</i> and <i>TP53</i> (54.5%), followed by <i>FBXW7</i> (27.3%). Most mutations in frequently altered genes in primary tumors were detectable in concurrent precancerous lesions (biliary intraepithelial neoplasia, BilIN), but a substantial proportion was subclonal. Subclonal diversity was common in BilIN (n=4). However, among subclones in BilIN, a certain subclone commonly shrank in concurrent primary tumors. In addition, selected subclones underwent linear and branching evolution, maintaining subclonal diversity. Combined analysis with metastatic tumors (n=11) identified branching evolution in 9 patients (81.8%). Of these, 8 patients (88.9%) had a total of 11 subclones expanded at least 7-fold during metastasis. These subclones harbored putative metastasis-driving mutations in cancer-related genes such as <i>SMAD4</i>, <i>ROBO1</i>, and <i>DICER1</i>. In mutational signature analysis, 6 mutational signatures were identified: 1, 3, 7, 13, 22, and 24 (cosine similarity &gt;0.9). Signatures 1 (age) and 13 (APOBEC) decreased during metastasis while signatures 22 (aristolochic acid) and 24 (aflatoxin) were relatively highlighted. Subclonal diversity arose early in precancerous lesions and clonal selection was a common event during malignant transformation in GBAC. However, selected cancer clones continued to evolve and thus maintained subclonal diversity in metastatic tumors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rhythmic coordination and ensemble dynamics in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during odor-place associative memory and decision making</a></h4>

              
                Memory-guided decision making involves long-range coordination across sensory and cognitive brain networks, with key roles for the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In order to investigate the mechanisms of such coordination, we monitored activity in hippocampus (CA1), PFC, and olfactory bulb (OB) in rats performing an odor-place associative memory guided decision task on a T-maze. During odor sampling, the beta (20-30 Hz) and respiratory (7-8 Hz) rhythms (RR) were prominent across the three regions, with beta and RR coherence between all pairs of regions enhanced during the odor-cued decision making period. Beta phase modulation of phase-locked CA1 and PFC neurons during this period was linked to accurate decisions, with a key role of CA1 interneurons in temporal coordination. Single neurons and ensembles in both CA1 and PFC encoded and predicted animals' upcoming choices, with different cell ensembles engaged during decision-making and decision execution on the maze. Our findings indicate that rhythmic coordination within the hippocampal-prefrontal-olfactory bulb network supports utilization of odor cues for memory-guided decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the mitoribosomal small subunit with streptomycin reveals Fe-S clusters and physiological molecules</a></h4>

              
                The mitoribosome regulates cellular energy production, and its dysfunction is associated with aging. Inhibition of the mitoribosome can be caused by off-target binding of antimicrobial drugs and was shown to be coupled with a bilateral decreased visual acuity. Previously, we reported mitochondria-specific protein aspects of the mitoribosome, and in this article we present a 2.4-Å resolution structure of the small subunit in a complex with the anti-tuberculosis drug streptomycin that reveals roles of non-protein components. We found iron–sulfur clusters that are coordinated by different mitoribosomal proteins, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) associated with rRNA insertion, and posttranslational modifications. This is the first evidence of inter-protein coordination of iron–sulfur, and the finding of iron–sulfur clusters and NAD as fundamental building blocks of the mitoribosome directly links to mitochondrial disease and aging. We also report details of streptomycin interactions, suggesting that the mitoribosome-bound streptomycin is likely to be in hydrated gem-diol form and can be subjected to other modifications by the cellular milieu. The presented approach of adding antibiotics to cultured cells can be used to define their native structures in a bound form under more physiological conditions, and since streptomycin is a widely used drug for treatment, the newly resolved features can serve as determinants for targeting.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel evolution of reduced cancer risk and tumor suppressor duplications in Xenarthra</a></h4>

              
                The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan within species, but there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan between species indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Previously we showed that several large bodied <i>Afrotherian</i> lineages evolved reduced intrinsic cancer risk, particularly elephants and their extinct relatives (<i>Proboscideans</i>), coincident with pervasive duplication of tumor suppressor genes (Vazquez and Lynch 2021). Unexpectedly, we also found that <i>Xenarthrans</i> (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) evolved very low intrinsic cancer risk. Here, we show that: 1) several <i>Xenarthran</i> lineages independently evolved large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced intrinsic cancer risk; 2) the reduced cancer risk in the stem lineages of <i>Xenarthra</i> and <i>Pilosa</i> coincided with bursts of tumor suppressor gene duplications; 3) cells from sloths proliferate extremely slowly while <i>Xenarthran</i> cells induce apoptosis at very low doses of DNA damaging agents; and 4) the prevalence of cancer is extremely low <i>Xenarthrans</i>, and cancer is nearly absent from armadillos. These data implicate the duplication of tumor suppressor genes in the evolution of remarkably large body sizes and decreased cancer risk in <i>Xenarthrans</i> and suggest they are a remarkably cancer resistant group of mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human Dectin-1 is O-glycosylated and serves as a ligand for C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2</a></h4>

              
                C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) elicit immune responses upon recognition of glycoconjugates present on pathogens and self-components. While Dectin-1 is the best-characterized CLR recognizing b-glucan on pathogens, the endogenous targets of Dectin-1 are not fully understood. Herein, we report that human Dectin-1 is a ligand for CLEC-2, another CLR expressed on platelets. Biochemical analyses revealed that Dectin-1 is a mucin-like protein as its stalk region is highly <i>O</i>-glycosylated. A sialylated core 1 glycan attached to the EDxxT motif of human Dectin-1, which is absent in mouse Dectin-1, provides a ligand moiety for CLEC-2. Strikingly, the expression of human Dectin-1 in mice rescued the lethality and lymphatic defect resulting from a deficiency of Podoplanin, a known CLEC-2 ligand. This finding is the first example of an innate immune receptor also functioning as a physiological ligand to regulate ontogeny upon glycosylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Scratch-AID: a deep-learning based system for automatic detection of mouse scratching behavior with high accuracy</a></h4>

              
                Mice are the most commonly used model animals for itch research and for development of anti-itch drugs. Most labs manually quantify mouse scratching behavior to assess itch intensity. This process is labor-intensive and limits large-scale genetic or drug screenings. In this study, we developed a new system, Scratch-AID Automatic Itch Detection), which could automatically identify and quantify mouse scratching behavior with high accuracy. Our system included a custom-designed videotaping box to ensure high-quality and replicable mouse behavior recording and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) trained with frame-labeled mouse scratching behavior videos, induced by nape injection of chloroquine (CQ). The best trained network achieved 97.6% recall and 96.9% precision on previously unseen test videos. Remarkably, Scratch-AID could reliably identify scratching behavior in other major mouse itch models, including the acute cheek model, the histaminergic model, and a chronic itch model. Moreover, our system detected significant differences in scratching behavior between control and mice treated with an anti-itch drug. Taken together, we have established a novel deep learning-based system that is ready to replace manual quantification for mouse scratching behavior in different itch models and for drug screening.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Feedback inhibition underlies new computational functions of cerebellar interneurons</a></h4>

              
                The function of a feedback inhibitory circuit between cerebellar Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) was defined by combining optogenetics, neuronal activity recordings both in cerebellar slices and <i>in vivo</i>, and computational modeling. Purkinje cells inhibit a subset of MLIs in the inner third of the molecular layer. This inhibition is non-reciprocal, short-range (less than 200 mm) and is based on convergence of 1-2 Purkinje cells onto MLIs. During learning-related eyelid movements <i>in vivo</i>, the activity of a subset of MLIs progressively increases as Purkinje cell activity decreases, with Purkinje cells usually leading the MLIs. Computer simulations indicate that these relationships are best explained by the feedback circuit from Purkinje cells to MLIs and that this feedback circuit plays a central role in making cerebellar learning efficient.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of adrenergic β1-AR/Gαs signaling promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in juvenile mice through activation of RhoA-YAP axis</a></h4>

              
                The regeneration potential of the mammalian heart is incredibly limited, as cardiomyocyte proliferation ceases shortly after birth. β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade has been shown to improve heart functions in response to injury; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we inhibited β-AR signaling in the heart using metoprolol, a cardio-selective β blocker for β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) to examine its role in heart maturation and regeneration in postnatal mice. We found that metoprolol enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction, resulting in reduced scar formation and improved cardiac function. Moreover, the increased cardiomyocyte proliferation was also induced by the genetic deletion of <i>Gnas</i>, the gene encoding G protein alpha subunit (Gαs), a downstream effector of β-AR. Genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed that the Hippo-effector YAP, which is associated with immature cardiomyocyte proliferation, was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes of b-blocker treated and <i>Gnas</i> cKO hearts. Moreover, the increased YAP activity is modulated by RhoA signaling. Our pharmacological and genetic studies reveal that b1-AR-Gas-YAP signaling axis is involved in regulating postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. These results suggest that inhibiting b-AR-Gas signaling promotes the regenerative capacity and extends the cardiac regenerative window in juvenile mice by activating YAP-mediated transcriptional programs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Critical roles for 'housekeeping' nucleases in Type III CRISPR-Cas immunity</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR-Cas systems are a family of adaptive immune systems that use small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to protect prokaryotes from invading plasmids and viruses (i.e. phages). Type III systems launch a multi-layered immune response that relies upon both Cas and non-Cas cellular nucleases, and although the functions of Cas components have been well described, the identities and roles of non-Cas participants remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> employs two degradosome-associated nucleases, PNPase and RNase J2, to promote crRNA maturation and eliminate invading nucleic acids (Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019). Here, we identify RNase R as a third 'housekeeping' nuclease critical for immunity. We show that RNase R works in concert with PNPase to complete crRNA maturation, and identify specific interactions with Csm5, a member of the Type III effector complex, which facilitate nuclease recruitment/stimulation. Further, we demonstrate that RNase R and PNPase are required to maintain robust anti-plasmid immunity, particularly when targeted transcripts are sparse. Altogether, our findings expand the known repertoire of accessory nucleases required for Type III immunity and highlight the remarkable capacity of these systems to interface with diverse cellular pathways to ensure successful defense.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Emotional learning retroactively promotes memory integration through rapid neural reactivation and reorganization</a></h4>

              
                Neutral events preceding emotional experiences can be better remembered, likely by assigning them as significant to guide possible use in future. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms of how emotional learning enhances memory for past mundane events remain unclear. By two behavioral studies and one functional magnetic resonance imaging study with an adapted sensory preconditioning paradigm, we show rapid neural reactivation and connectivity changes underlying emotion-charged retroactive memory enhancement. Behaviorally, emotional learning enhanced initial memory for neutral associations across the three studies. Neurally, emotional learning potentiated trial-specific reactivation of overlapping neural traces in the hippocampus and stimulus-relevant neocortex. It further induced rapid hippocampal-neocortical functional reorganization supporting such retroactive memory benefit, as characterized by enhanced hippocampal-neocortical coupling modulated by the amygdala during emotional learning, and a shift of hippocampal connectivity from stimulus-relevant neocortex to transmodal prefrontal-parietal areas at post-learning rests. Together, emotional learning retroactively promotes memory integration for past neutral events through stimulating trial-specific reactivation of overlapping representations and reorganization of associated memories into an integrated network to foster its priority for future use.

                Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) are frequently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including increased risk for restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs). Consistent with observations in humans, FXS model mice display distinct RRBs and hyperactivity that are consistent with dysfunctional cortico-striatal circuits, an area relatively unexplored in FXS. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we dissected the contribution of two populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (SPNs) in the expression of RRBs in FXS model mice. We found that dysregulated protein synthesis at cortico-striatal synapses is a molecular culprit of the synaptic and ASD-associated motor phenotypes displayed by FXS model mice. Cell-type-specific translational profiling of the FXS mouse striatum revealed differentially translated mRNAs, providing critical information concerning potential therapeutic targets. Our findings represent the first evidence of a cell-type specific impact of the loss of FMRP on translation and the sequence of neuronal events in the striatum that drive RRBs in FXS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">At Which Low Amplitude Modulated Frequency Do Infants Best Entrain? A Frequency Tagging Study</a></h4>

              
                Previous infant entrainment research has shown neural entrainment to a wide range of stimuli and amplitude modulated frequencies. However, it is unknown if infants neurally entrain more strongly to some frequencies more than others, and to which low amplitude modulated frequency infants show the strongest entrainment. The current study seeks to address this by testing the neural entrainment of N=23 4-6-month-old infants and N=22 control group adult caregivers while they listened to a range of sinusoidally amplitude modulated beep stimuli at rest (no sound), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 Hz. Analysis examined differences across power and phase, regions of interest predetermined by previous literature and by segmented time windows. Results showed that the strongest entrainment was at 2Hz for both adult and infant participants; that there was no significant difference in power and phase, entrainment was occipital temporal and slightly left fronto-central in adults and right fronto-central and left occipito-temporal in infants, leading to some regions of interest used in previous studies being significant in infants and all regions of interest being significant in adults. Segmenting by time window did not show any significant increase or decrease in entrainment over time, but longer time windows showed a stronger entrainment response. In conclusion, it is important to choose appropriate stimulation frequencies when investigating entrainment between stimulation frequencies or across ages; whole head recording is recommended to see the full extent of activation; there is no preference on power vs phase analyses; and longer recordings show stronger effects.

                Brain-computer interface (BCI) experiments have shown that animals are able to adapt their recorded neural activity in order to receive reward. Recent studies have highlighted two phenomena. First, the speed at which a BCI task can be learned is dependent on how closely the required neural activity aligns with pre-existing activity patterns: learning "out-of-manifold" tasks is slower than "in-manifold" tasks. Second, learning happens by "re-association": the overall distribution of neural activity patterns does not change significantly during task learning. These phenomena have been presented as distinctive aspects of BCI learning. Here we show, using simulations and theoretical analysis, that both phenomena result from the simple assumption that behaviour and representations are improved via gradient-based algorithms. We invoke Occam's Razor to suggest that this straightforward explanation should be preferred when accounting for these experimental observations.

                Sexual behaviour is the sine qua non for procreation for several species and is traditionally viewed to be regulated by sex steroid hormones. However, several species exhibit steroid-independent sexual behaviour, and its molecular understanding is only beginning to be uncovered. We do not yet have a cell-specific understanding of the roles non-neuronal cells play in this phenomenon. Forty B6D2F1 hybrid male mice underwent orchidectomy and some of them exhibited consistent ejaculatory reflexes at least 62 weeks post-orchidectomy over 11 sexual behaviour tests (>180 minutes each), defined as steroid-independent (SI) maters (21.80%), and those that do not, defined as SI non-maters (25%). Using flow cytometry, we compared the preoptic area immunoexpression in NeuN+ neurons and Iba1+ microglia between SI maters and SI non-maters (n = 6 per group). We found neuronal immunoexpression up-regulated for amyloid precursor protein and androgen receptor, as well as down-regulated for glucocorticoid receptor. In conjunction, microglial immunoexpression of amyloid precursor protein up-regulated. These data suggest there are cell-specific immunoexpression changes including a role of non-neuronal cells in steroid-independent male sexual behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult born hippocampal granule cells promote pattern separation by bidirectionally modulating the remapping of place and cue cells.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits a unique form of neural plasticity that results from continuous integration of adult born neurons, referred to as adult neurogenesis. Recent studies have proposed that adult neurogenesis promotes the ability to encode new memories without interference from previously stored memories that share similar features, through a neural computation known as pattern separation. However, due to lack of in vivo physiological evidence, the manner in which adult neurogenesis contributes to pattern separation remains unknown. Here, we investigate the contribution of functionally integrated yet immature adult born granule cells (iGCs) to DG computations by examining how chronic ablation or acute chemogenetic silencing of iGCs affects the activity of mature granule cells (mGCs) using in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. In both cases we observed altered remapping of mGCs but in opposite directions depending on their tuning selectivity. Rather than broadly modulating the activity of all mGCs, iGCs promote the remapping of place cells but limit the remapping of mGCs representing sensory cues (cue cells). We propose that these properties of iGCs explain their role in pattern separation because they promote the formation of non-overlapping representations for identical sensory cues encountered in different locations. Conversely, the absence of iGCs shifts the DG network to a state dominated by sensory cue information, a situation that is consistent with the overgeneralization often observed in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.

                The mammalian visual system can be broadly divided into two functional processing pathways: a dorsal stream supporting visually and spatially guided actions, and a ventral stream enabling object recognition. In rodents, the majority of visual signaling in the dorsal stream is transmitted to frontal motor cortices via extrastriate visual areas surrounding V1, but exactly where and to what extent V1 feeds into motor-projecting visual regions is not well known. To address this we employed a dual labeling strategy in male and female mice in which efferent projections from V1 were labeled anterogradely, and motor-projecting neurons in higher visual areas were labeled with retrogradely traveling adeno-associated virus (rAAV-retro) injected in M2. In flattened sections of dorsal cortex, the most pronounced colocalization V1 output and M2 input occurred in extrastriate areas AM, PM, RL and AL. Coronal sections further showed that neurons in both superficial and deep layers in these regions project to M2, but high resolution volumetric reconstructions revealed that the vast majority of putative synaptic contacts from V1 onto M2-projecting neurons occurred in layer 2/3. These findings support the existence of a dorsal processing stream in the mouse visual system, where visual signals reach motor cortex largely via feedforward projections in anteriorly and medially located extrastriate areas.

                Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) most often leads to permanent paralysis due to the inability of axons to regenerate in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In the past, we have shown that mast cells (MCs) improve the functional outcome after SCI by suppressing scar tissue formation at the lesion site via mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP6). In this study, we investigated whether recombinant mMCP6 can be used therapeutically to improve the functional outcome after SCI. Therefore, we applied mMCP6 locally via an intrathecal catheter in the subacute phase after a spinal cord hemisection injury in mice. Our findings showed that hind limb motor function was significantly improved in mice that received recombinant mMCP6 compared to the vehicle-treated group. In contrast to our previous findings in mMCP6 knockout mice, the lesion size and expression levels of the scar components fibronectin, laminin, and axon growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were not affected by the treatment with recombinant mMCP6. Surprisingly, no difference in infiltration of CD4+ T cells and reactivity of Iba-1+ microglia/macrophages at the lesion site was observed between the mMCP6 treated mice and control mice. Additionally, local protein levels of the pro- and anti inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL 10, TNF-, IFN{gamma}, and MCP-1 were comparable between the two treatment groups, indicating that locally applied mMCP6 did not affect inflammatory processes after injury. However, the increase in locomotor performance in mMCP6-treated mice was accompanied by reduced demyelination and astrogliosis in the perilesional area after SCI. Consistently, we found that TNF-a/IL-1B-astrocyte activation was decreased, and that oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation was increased after recombinant mMCP6 treatment in vitro. Mechanistically, this suggests effects of mMCP6 on reducing astrogliosis and improving (re)myelination in the spinal cord after injury. In conclusion, these data show for the first time that recombinant mMCP6 is therapeutically active in enhancing recovery after SCI.

                Despite being twice as likely to get Alzheimer's disease (AD), African Americans have been grossly underrepresented in AD research. While emerging evidence indicates that African Americans with AD have lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Tau compared to Caucasians, other differences in AD CSF biomarkers have not been fully elucidated. Here, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling of CSF from African Americans and Caucasians with and without AD to identify both common and divergent AD CSF biomarkers. Multiplex tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) quantified 1,840 proteins from 105 control and 98 AD patients of which 100 identified as Caucasian while 103 identified as African American. Consistent with previous findings, the increase of Tau levels in AD was greater in Caucasians than in African Americans by both immunoassay and TMT-MS measurements. Network analysis organized the CSF proteome into 14 modules associated with brain cell-types and biological pathways. CSF modules which included 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ and YWHAG), demonstrated equivalent disease-related elevations in both African Americans and Caucasians with AD, whereas other modules demonstrated more profound disease changes within race. Modules enriched with proteins involved with glycolysis and neuronal/cytoskeletal proteins, including Tau, were more increased in Caucasians than in African Americans with AD. In contrast, a module enriched with synaptic proteins including VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2 was significantly lower in African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Using a targeted proteomic approach (selected reaction monitoring) followed by a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis we measured levels of VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2, which were significantly better at classifying African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Collectively, our findings provide insight into additional protein biomarkers and pathways reflecting underlying brain pathology that are shared or differ by race.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations optimize information rate in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Low-frequency oscillations shape how neurons sample their synaptic inputs, hence regulating information exchange among neural circuits. In the hippocampus, theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) enable the temporal organization of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code. However, the advantages of the specific theta band over other frequency ranges remain unclear. It is possible that this specific frequency range is optimizing a trade-off between information throughput and biophysical constraints of the neuronal substrate. To test this hypothesis, we analyze a physiologically constrained model of the rodent hippocampus comprising stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons driven by oscillations. By estimating the information rate of the phase code for a range of noise and frequency levels, we identify a trade-off between sampling frequency and coding precision. We observe that, under physiological noise levels, theta-band oscillations optimize the speed-precision trade-off, maximizing information rate. Further, we demonstrate that theta optimizes this trade-off throughout the entire dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus with its pronounced gradients of several physiological properties. In addition, we find that maintaining an optimal information rate relies on the concurrent modulation of both frequency and amplitude, hence explaining the locomotion speed-dependent modulations of the hippocampal theta oscillation that are observed in rodents and humans. Overall, our results suggest that low-frequency oscillations are adapted to maximize the information rate of neural sampling given the temporal and biophysical constraints under which neural circuits operate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory gating of thalamocortical inputs onto rat gustatory insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the rat primary gustatory cortex (GC), a subregion of the larger insular cortex, neurons display time-varying neural responses to gustatory stimuli. GC taste responses are dramatically reduced following inactivation of the gustatory thalamus, the parvicellular region of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPMpc). Pharmacological inactivation of VPMpc also has a profound effect on GC spontaneous activity. This indicates that the projection from VPMpc plays a crucial role in GC taste processing as well as in the control of its state. How VPMpc afferents engage GC circuits and drive neuronal ensembles to effectively code tastant identity, as well as modulate the overall state of the GC network, remains unclear. To investigate the synaptic properties and organization of VPMpc afferents in GC, we employed a circuit-breaking optogenetic approach, stimulating VPMpc terminal fields while performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from GC neurons in rat acute slices. Informed by previous studies of thalamocortical inputs to other sensory cortices, we hypothesized that VPMpc-GC synapses have laminar- and cell-specific properties that gate sensory input, conferring computationally flexibility to how taste information is processed in GC. We found that VPMpc-GC synapses are strongly gated by the activity regime of VPMpc afferents, as well as by feedforward and feedback inhibition onto VPMpc terminals. These results provide novel insight into the circuit underpinning of GC responsiveness to incoming thalamocortical activity.

                The two pituitary gonadotropins, Fsh and Lh, regulate the reproductive function in vertebrates. While many studies have investigated the regulation of gonadotropin production and release by the sex steroid feedback, its role on the regulation of gonadotrope cell number remains unclear. Using medaka as a model and an optimized protocol to restore physiological sex steroids levels following gonadectomy, we show that gonadal sex steroids not only decrease fshb transcript levels, but also Fsh cell number in both sexes. We then investigated the origin of the Fsh cell hyperplasia induced by gonadectomy. In both sexes, BrdU incubation shows that this is achieved via Fsh cell mitosis. In situ hybridization reveals that new Fsh cells also originate from transdifferentiating Tsh cells in females, but not in males. Both phenomena are inhibited by sex steroid supplementation via feeding. In males (but not females), gonadectomy (without recovery with sex steroid supplementation) also reduces sox2 transcript levels and Sox2-immunopositive population volume, suggesting that sox2-progenitors may be recruited to produce new Fsh cells. Opposite to Fsh cells, gonadectomy decreases lhb levels in both sexes, and levels are not restored by sex steroid supplementation. In addition, the regulation of Lh cell number also seems to be sex dependent. Removal of gonadal sex steroids stimulates Lh cell mitosis in male (like Fsh cells), but not in females. To conclude, our study provides the first evidence on sexually dimorphic mechanisms used in the fish pituitary to remodel gonadotrope populations in response to sex steroids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theory of systems memory consolidation via recall-gated plasticity</a></h4>

              
                In a variety of species and behavioral contexts, learning and memory formation recruits two neural systems, with initial plasticity in one system being consolidated into the other over time. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve learning rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments. We show that recall-gated consolidation gives rise to a number of phenomena that are present in behavioral learning paradigms, including spaced learning effects, task-dependent rates of consolidation, and differing neural representations in short- and long-term pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unveiling the time course of visual stabilization through human electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Positions of objects are coded relative to their surroundings, presumably providing visual stability even when we move our eyes around a visual scene. But when does this perceived stability of objects arise? Here we use a visual illusion, the frame-induced position shift, and measure electrophysiological activity elicited by an object whose perceived position is either shifted due to a surrounding frame or not, thus dissociating perceived and physical locations. We found that early visually-evoked responses were sensitive to physical location information earlier in time (~70ms) than perceived location information (~140ms). Furthermore, we show that location information can be reliably decoded across physical and perceived locations during the later time interval (140-180ms) but not during the earlier time interval (70-110ms). Together these results suggest that visual stability of objects emerges relatively late and is thus dependent on recurrent feedback from higher processing stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic activation of visual thalamus generates artificial visual percepts</a></h4>

              
                The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a retinotopic relay center where visual inputs from the retina are processed and relayed to the visual cortex, has been proposed as a potential target for artificial vision. At present, it is unknown whether optogenetic LGN stimulation is sufficient to elicit behaviorally relevant percepts and the properties of LGN neural responses relevant for artificial vision have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that tree shrews pretrained on a visual detection task can detect optogenetic LGN activation using an AAV2-CamKII-ChR2 construct and readily generalize from visual to optogenetic detection. We also characterize how amplitude and frequency of optogenetic stimulation affect behavioral performance. Given the importance of temporal stimulation parameters, we also study tree shrew behavioral ability to discriminate among pairs of visual flicker frequencies and demonstrate performance transfer among related discrimination problems as well as limitations. Neural recordings in LGN and primary visual cortex (V1) examining two flicker discriminations reveal that while LGN neurons multiplex information about temporal stimulation discriminations, V1 neurons explicitly encode information about one or the other discriminations but not both. Our findings confirm the LGN as a potential target for visual prosthetics and introduce a distinction in stimulus encoding between thalamic and cortical representations that could be of fundamental importance in artificial vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Senescent Schwann cells induced by aging and chronic denervation impair axonal regeneration after peripheral nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                After peripheral nerve injuries, successful axonal growth and functional recovery requires the reprogramming of Schwann cells into a reparative phenotype, a process dependent on the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun. Nevertheless, axonal regeneration is greatly impaired in aged organisms or after chronic denervation leading to important clinical problems. This regenerative failure has been associated to a diminished c-Jun expression by Schwann cells, but whether the inability of these cells to maintain a repair state is associated to the transition into a phenotype inhibitory for axonal growth, has not been evaluated so far. We find that repair Schwann cells transitions into a senescent phenotype, characterized by diminished c-Jun expression and secretion of factor inhibitory for axonal regeneration in both aging and chronic denervation. In both conditions, elimination of senescent Schwann cells by systemic senolytic drug treatment or genetic targeting improves nerve regeneration and functional recovery in aging and chronic denervation, associated with an upregulation of c-Jun expression and a decrease in nerve inflammation. This work provides the first characterization of senescent Schwann cells and their impact over axonal regeneration in aging and chronic denervation, opening new avenues for enhancing regeneration, and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries.

	<p>Although previous studies have reported a facial expression classification deficit among adults with SDB, we do not know whether these findings can be generalized to children. In our study, children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) were divided into three groups: primary snoring (n = 51), mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (n = 39), and moderate/severe OSA (n = 26). All participants, including 20 healthy controls, underwent an overnight polysomnography recording and the Emotional Expression Recognition Task. Psychosocial problems were evaluated using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). There was a borderline significant interaction between expression category and group on reaction times. Further analysis revealed that positive classification advantage (PCA) disappeared in the moderate/severe OSA group, whereas it persisted in the control, primary snoring, and mild OSA groups. Emotional symptoms were positively correlated with OAHI. In both the happy and sad conditions, RT was negatively related to age and body mass index (BMI) but was independent of the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI), arterial oxygen (SaO2) and total sleep time. The accuracy of identifying a sad expression was negatively related to conduct problems. Children with moderate/severe OSA exhibited dysfunction in facial expression categorization, which could potentially affect social communication ability.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterised by demyelination in the central nervous system. The cuprizone-induced demyelination model is often used in mice to test novel treatments for multiple sclerosis. However, despite significant demyelination, behavioural deficits may be subtle or have mixed results depending on the paradigm used. Furthermore, the sex differences within the model are not well understood. In the current study, we have sought to understand the behavioural deficits associated with the cuprizone-induced demyelination model in both male and female C57BL/6J mice. Using Black gold II stain, we found that cuprizone administration over 6 weeks caused significant demyelination in the corpus callosum that was consistent across both sexes. Cuprizone administration caused increased mechanical sensitivity when measured using an electronic von Frey aesthesiometer, with no sex differences observed. However, cuprizone administration decreased motor coordination, with more severe deficits seen in males in the horizontal bar and passive wire hang tests. In contrast, female mice showed more severe deficits in the motor skill sequence test. Cuprizone administration caused more anxiety-like behaviours in males compared to females in the elevated zero maze. Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the sex differences involved in the behavioural aspects of cuprizone-induced demyelination, which could allow for a better translation of results from the laboratory to the clinic.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Attention is an important cognitive process in daily life. However, limited cognitive resources have been allocated to attention, especially for multiple objects and its mechanism is still unclear. Most of the previous studies have been based on the static attention paradigms with relatively lower ecological validity. Thus, we aimed to explore the attention processing mechanism in a multiple object tracking (MOT) task by using a dynamic attention paradigm. Two experiments were conducted to assess whether there was a multi-focus attention processing model, and whether the processing model changes with the number of target balls. (2) Methods: During the experiments, 33 university students completed MOT combined with the simultaneous&amp;amp;ndash;sequential paradigm, with tracking accuracy and reaction time of correct reaction as indicators. (3) Results: 1) When there were two target balls, an obvious bilateral field advantage was apparent. 2) When there were four target balls, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; performance was significantly better when stimuli were presented simultaneously than when they were presented sequentially, showing a multi-focus attention processing model. (4) Conclusion: Attention processing is characterized by flexibility, providing strong evidence to support the multi-focus theory.</p>

	<p>The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) provides a direct trajectory to ventral skull base lesions, avoidance of brain retraction, and clear visualization of cranial nerves as they exit skull base foramina. Despite these benefits, the EEA is not without complications. Here, we review published literature highlighting complications associated with the EEA including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, cranial nerve (CN) dysfunction, pituitary gland dysfunction, internal carotid artery (ICA) injury, infection, and others; we place special emphasis on discussing the prevention of these complications. As widespread adoption of the EEA continues, it becomes critical to educate surgeons regarding potential complications and their prevention while identifying gaps in the current literature to guide future research and advances in clinical care.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits that usually have an impact on quality of life and independence. To reduce impairment, various rehabilitation programs have been proposed, but their effects on both cognitive and motor aspects have not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, most intervention is focused on lower limb treatment rather than upper limbs. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 3-week upper limb vibratory stimulation training on cognitive functioning in 20 individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. We analyzed cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trial Making Test, Digit Symbol, Digit Span Forward and Backward and Alertness) and motor performance (Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;part III; Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire) before treatment, at the end of treatment and one month post treatment. After rehabilitation, a statistically significant improvement was observed in terms of global cognitive status, attention, global motor functioning and disability. The results suggest an impact of upper limb motor rehabilitation on cognition in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Future studies on neuromotor interventions should investigate their effects on cognitive functioning to improve understanding of cognitive motor interaction in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>Exposure to light at night, insomnia, and disrupted circadian patterns could be considered risk factors for developing noncommunicable diseases. Understanding the awareness of the general population about the abovementioned factors could be essential to predict noncommunicable diseases. This report aimed to investigate the general community&amp;amp;rsquo;s interest in circadian, insomnia, metabolism, and light using Google Trends, and to evaluate results from different geographic areas. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for the factors mentioned, filtered by the &amp;amp;ldquo;Health&amp;amp;rdquo; category, were collected between 2007 and 2021. Moreover, RSVs were analysed in five different European languages. Worldwide mean RSVs for &amp;amp;ldquo;Circadian&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;Insomnia&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;Light&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;Metabolism&amp;amp;rdquo; during the study period were 2%, 13.4%, 62.2%, and 10%, respectively. In different developed countries, searching for light, insomnia, and metabolism were different, suggesting a variable level of awareness. Limited knowledge about the circadian pattern of human activities was detected. The highest correlation coefficient was calculated. Our results suggest the potential role of extensive data analysis in understanding the public interest and awareness about these risk factors. Moreover, it should be interpreted as the onset of stimulus for researchers to use comprehensible language for reaching comprehensive media coverage to prevent sleep and circadian system disturbances.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The first oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs, <i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2, yellow cells) are detected in the preoptical area of the hypothalamus at 2 dpf. One day later, 3 dpf, these cells invade the optic chiasm and colonize the postchiasmatic region first and the prechiasmatic later (yellow cells). As they differentiate to oligodendrocytes, OPCs present more protrussions that wrap the optic nerve (ON) and become positive also for <i>sox10:tagRFP</i> (cyan cells). These triple-labeled cells are very abundant in the ON at 5 dpf. At 7 dpf, differentiated oligodendrocytes (<i>olig2:EGFP</i>) with long protrusions that ensheath the ON are only positive for <i>sox10:tagRFP</i> and not for Sox2 (white cells). The three different populations can be observed surrounding the ON. At 11 dpf, the enseathing process continues. The first evidence of myelination in the ON is at 5 dpf, based on our transgenic line <i>mbpa:tagRFPt</i> (blue square patterned cells). We have also found that Olig2 and Sox2 might play a role in the differentiation of other retinal cells including the Müller glia and that the oligodendrocytes in the optic tectum differentiate earlier than those in the ON.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system. In birds and mammals, the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) originate in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus. However, it remains unclear in other vertebrates such as fish. Thus, we have studied the early progression of OPCs during zebrafish visual morphogenesis from 2 days post fertilization (dpf) until 11 dpf using the <i>olig2:EGFP</i> transgenic line; and we have analyzed the differential expression of transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation: Sox2 (using immunohistochemistry) and Sox10 (using the transgenic line <i>sox10:tagRFP</i>). The first OPCs (<i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2) were found at 2 dpf in the POA. From 3 dpf onwards, these <i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2 cells migrate to the optic chiasm, where they invade the optic nerve (ON), extending toward the retina. At 5 dpf, <i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2 cells in the ON also colocalize with <i>sox10:tagRFP</i>. When <i>olig2:EGFP</i> cells differentiate and present more projections, they become positive only for <i>sox10:tagRFP</i>. <i>olig2:EGFP/sox10: tagRFP</i> cells ensheath the ON by 5 dpf when they also become positive for a myelin marker, based on the <i>mbpa:tagRFPt</i> transgenic line. We also found <i>olig2:EGFP</i> cells in other regions of the visual system. In the central retina at 2 dpf, they are positive for Sox2 but later become restricted to the proliferative germinal zone without this marker. In the ventricular areas of the optic tectum, <i>olig2:EGFP</i> cells present Sox2 but arborized ones <i>sox10:tagRFP</i> instead. Our data matches with other models, where OPCs are specified in the POA and migrate to the ON through the optic chiasm.</p>

     alt="Emotional recognition across the adult lifespan: Effects of age, sex, cognitive empathy, alexithymia traits, and amygdala subnuclei volumes"/>
<p>This multidimensional assessment of emotion recognition in healthy adults suggested that age could affect emotion recognition differently in men and women, and these age-related differences were not mediated by amygdala volume. Our results also indicated that emotion-processing factors are not independent of personality traits and general cognition.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to recognize others' emotions is vital to everyday life. The goal of this study was to assess which emotions show age-related decline in recognition accuracy of facial emotional expressions across the entire adult lifespan and how this process is related to cognitive empathy (Theory of Mind [ToM]), alexithymia traits, and amygdala subnuclei volumes in a large cohort of healthy individuals. We recruited 140 healthy participants 18–85 years old. Facial affect processing was assessed with the Penn Emotion Recognition task (ER40) that contains images of the five basic emotions: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, and Fearful. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were acquired on a 4.7T MRI system. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationship between studied variables. We found that while both sexes demonstrated age-related reduction in recognition of happy emotions and preserved recognition of sadness, male participants showed age-related reduction in recognition of fear, while in female participants, age-related decline was linked to recognition of neutral and angry facial expressions. In both sexes, accurate recognition of sadness negatively correlated with alexithymia traits. On the other hand, better ToM capabilities in male participants were associated with improvement in recognition of positive and neutral emotions. Finally, none of the observed age-related reductions in emotional recognition were related to amygdala and its subnuclei volumes. In contrast, both global volume of amygdala and its cortical and centromedial subnuclei had significant direct effects on recognition of sad images.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Juvenile Shank3 KO Mice Adopt Distinct Hunting Strategies during Prey Capture Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mice are opportunistic omnivores that readily learn to hunt and eat insects such as crickets. The details of how mice learn these behaviors and how these behaviors may differ in strains with altered neuroplasticity are unclear. We quantified the behavior of juvenile wild-type (WT) and Shank3 knock-out (KO) mice as they learned to hunt crickets during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. This stage involves heightened cortical plasticity including homeostatic synaptic scaling, which requires Shank3, a glutamatergic synaptic protein that, when mutated, produces Phelan-McDermid syndrome and is often comorbid with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both strains showed interest in examining live and dead crickets and learned to hunt. Shank3 knock-out mice took longer to become proficient, and, after 5 d, did not achieve the efficiency of wild-type mice in either time-to-capture or distance-to-capture. Shank3 knock-out mice also exhibited different characteristics when pursuing crickets that could not be explained by a simple motor deficit. Although both genotypes moved at the same average speed when approaching a cricket, Shank3 KO mice paused more often, did not begin final accelerations toward crickets as early, and did not close the distance gap to the cricket as quickly as wild-type mice. These differences in Shank3 KO mice are reminiscent of some behavioral characteristics of individuals with ASD as they perform complex tasks, such as slower action initiation and completion. This paradigm will be useful for exploring the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie these learning and performance differences in monogenic ASD rodent models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">GnRH Neuron Excitability and Action Potential Properties Change with Development But Are Not Affected by Prenatal Androgen Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the final output from the brain to control pituitary gonadotropin secretion and thus regulate reproduction. Disruptions to gonadotropin secretion contribute to infertility, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women and symptoms resembling PCOS are observed in girls at or near the time of pubertal onset, suggesting that alterations to the system likely occurred by that developmental period. Prenatally androgenized (PNA) female mice recapitulate many of the neuroendocrine phenotypes observed in PCOS, including altered time of puberty, disrupted reproductive cycles, increased circulating levels of testosterone, and altered gonadotropin secretion patterns. We tested the hypotheses that the intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons change with puberty and with PNA treatment. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from GnRH neurons in brain slices from control and PNA females before puberty at three weeks of age and in adulthood to measure GnRH neuron excitability and action potential (AP) properties. GnRH neurons from adult females were more excitable and required less current to initiate action potential firing compared with three-week-old females. Further, the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential of the first spike was larger and its peak was delayed in adulthood. These results indicate development, not PNA, is a primary driver of changes to GnRH neuron intrinsic properties and suggest there may be developmentally-induced changes to voltage-gated ion channels in GnRH neurons that alter how these cells respond to synaptic input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amygdala Intercalated Cells: Gate Keepers and Conveyors of Internal State to the Circuits of Emotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Generating adaptive behavioral responses to emotionally salient stimuli requires evaluation of complex associations between multiple sensations, the surrounding context, and current internal state. Neural circuits within the amygdala parse this emotional information, undergo synaptic plasticity to reflect learned associations, and evoke appropriate responses through their projections to the brain regions orchestrating these behaviors. Information flow within the amygdala is regulated by the intercalated cells (ITCs), which are densely packed clusters of GABAergic neurons that encircle the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and provide contextually relevant feedforward inhibition of amygdala nuclei, including the central and BLA. Emerging studies have begun to delineate the unique contribution of each ITC cluster and establish ITCs as key loci of plasticity in emotional learning. In this review, we summarize the known connectivity and function of individual ITC clusters and explore how different neuromodulators conveying internal state act via ITC gates to shape emotionally motivated behavior. We propose that the behavioral state-dependent function of ITCs, their unique genetic profile, and rich expression of neuromodulator receptors make them potential therapeutic targets for disorders, such as anxiety, schizophrenia spectrum, and addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Regulation of the BDNF Gene in Cortical and Hippocampal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed neurotrophin that supports the survival, differentiation, and signaling of various neuronal populations. Although it has been well described that expression of BDNF is strongly regulated by neuronal activity, little is known whether regulation of BDNF expression is similar in different brain regions. Here, we focused on this fundamental question using neuronal populations obtained from rat cerebral cortices and hippocampi of both sexes. First, we thoroughly characterized the role of the best-described regulators of BDNF gene - cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors, and show that activity-dependent BDNF expression depends more on CREB and the coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in cortical than in hippocampal neurons. Our data also reveal an important role of CREB in the early induction of BDNF mRNA expression after neuronal activity and only modest contribution after prolonged neuronal activity. We further corroborated our findings at BDNF protein level. To determine the transcription factors regulating BDNF expression in these rat brain regions in addition to CREB family, we used <I>in vitro</I> DNA pulldown assay coupled with mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and bioinformatics, and propose a number of neurodevelopmentally important transcription factors, such as FOXP1, SATB2, RAI1, BCL11A, and TCF4 as brain region-specific regulators of BDNF expression. Together, our data reveal complicated brain region-specific fine-tuning of BDNF expression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To date, majority of the research has focused on the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain but much less is known whether the regulation of BDNF expression is universal in different brain regions and neuronal populations. Here, we report that the best described regulators of BDNF gene from the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor family have a more profound role in the activity-dependent regulation of BDNF in cortex than in hippocampus. Our results indicate a brain region-specific fine tuning of BDNF expression. Moreover, we have used unbiased determination of novel regulators of the BDNF gene and report a number of neurodevelopmentally important transcription factors as novel potential regulators of the BDNF expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The RNA-Binding Protein HuR Is Integral to the Function of Nociceptors in Mice and Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>HuR is an RNA-binding protein implicated in RNA processing, stability, and translation. Previously, we examined protein synthesis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We found that the HuR consensus binding element was enriched in transcripts with elevated translation. HuR is expressed in the soma of nociceptors and their axons. Pharmacologic inhibition of HuR with the small molecule CMLD-2 reduced the activity of mouse and human sensory neurons. Peripheral administration of CMLD-2 in the paw or genetic elimination of HuR from sensory neurons diminished behavioral responses associated with NGF- and IL-6-induced allodynia in male and female mice. Genetic disruption of HuR altered the proximity of mRNA decay factors near a key neurotrophic factor (TrkA). Collectively, the data suggest that HuR is required for local control of mRNA stability and reveals a new biological function for a broadly conserved post-transcriptional regulatory factor.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nociceptors undergo long-lived changes in excitability, which may contribute to chronic pain. Noxious cues that promote pain lead to rapid induction of protein synthesis. The underlying mechanisms that confer specificity to mRNA control in nociceptors are unclear. Here, we identify a conserved RNA-binding protein called HuR as a key regulatory factor in sensory neurons. Using a combination of genetics and pharmacology, we demonstrate that HuR is required for signaling in nociceptors. In doing so, we report an important mechanism of mRNA control in sensory neurons that ensures appropriate nociceptive responses to inflammatory mediators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emergence of Distinct Neural Subspaces in Motor Cortical Dynamics during Volitional Adjustments of Ongoing Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to modulate ongoing walking gait with precise, voluntary adjustments is what allows animals to navigate complex terrains. However, how the nervous system generates the signals to precisely control the limbs while simultaneously maintaining locomotion is poorly understood. One potential strategy is to distribute the neural activity related to these two functions into distinct cortical activity coactivation subspaces so that both may be conducted simultaneously without disruptive interference. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded the activity of primary motor cortex in male nonhuman primates during obstacle avoidance on a treadmill. We found that the same neural population was active during both basic unobstructed locomotion and volitional obstacle avoidance movements. We identified the neural modes spanning the subspace of the low-dimensional dynamics in primary motor cortex and found a subspace that consistently maintains the same cyclic activity throughout obstacle stepping, despite large changes in the movement itself. All of the variance corresponding to this large change in movement during the obstacle avoidance was confined to its own distinct subspace. Furthermore, neural decoders built for ongoing locomotion did not generalize to decoding obstacle avoidance during locomotion. Our findings suggest that separate underlying subspaces emerge during complex locomotion that coordinates ongoing locomotor-related neural dynamics with volitional gait adjustments. These findings may have important implications for the development of brain&ndash;machine interfaces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Locomotion and precise, goal-directed movements are two distinct movement modalities with known differing requirements of motor cortical input. Previous studies have characterized the cortical activity during obstacle avoidance while walking in rodents and felines, but, to date, no such studies have been completed in primates. Additionally, in any animal model, it is unknown how these two movements are represented in primary motor cortex (M1) low-dimensional dynamics when both activities are performed at the same time, such as during obstacle avoidance. We developed a novel obstacle avoidance paradigm in freely moving nonhuman primates and discovered that the rhythmic locomotion-related dynamics and the voluntary, gait-adjustment movement separate into distinct subspaces in M1 cortical activity. Our analysis of decoding generalization may also have important implications for the development of brain&ndash;machine interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Role for Thalamic Projection GABAergic Neurons in Circadian Responses to Light</a></h4>

              
                <p>The thalamus is an important hub for sensory information and participates in sensory perception, regulation of attention, arousal and sleep. These functions are executed primarily by glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons that extend axons to the cortex and initiate cortico-thalamocortical connectional loops. However, the thalamus also contains projection GABAergic neurons that do not extend axons toward the cortex. Here, we have harnessed recent insight into the development of the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv) to specifically target and manipulate thalamic projection GABAergic neurons in female and male mice. Our results show that thalamic GABAergic neurons of the IGL and LGv receive retinal input from diverse classes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) but not from the M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) type. We describe the synergistic role of the photoreceptor melanopsin and the thalamic neurons of the IGL/LGv in circadian entrainment to dim light. We identify a requirement for the thalamic IGL/LGv neurons in the rapid changes in vigilance states associated with circadian light transitions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv) are part of the extended circadian system and mediate some nonimage-forming visual functions. Here, we show that each of these structures has a thalamic (dorsal) as well as prethalamic (ventral) developmental origin. We map the retinal input to thalamus-derived cells in the IGL/LGv complex and discover that while RGC input is dominant, this is not likely to originate from M1ipRGCs. We implicate thalamic cells in the IGL/LGv in vigilance state transitions at circadian light changes and in overt behavioral entrainment to dim light, the latter exacerbated by concomitant loss of melanopsin expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nociceptive Stimuli Activate the Hypothalamus-Habenula Circuit to Inhibit the Mesolimbic Reward System and Cocaine-Seeking Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nociceptive signals interact with various regions of the brain, including those involved in physical sensation, reward, cognition, and emotion. Emerging evidence points to a role of nociception in the modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. The mechanism by which nociception affects dopamine (DA) signaling and reward is unclear. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the lateral habenula (LHb) receive somatosensory inputs and are structurally connected with the mesolimbic DA system. Here, we show that the LH&ndash;LHb pathway is necessary for nociceptive modulation of this system using male Sprague Dawley rats. Our extracellular single-unit recordings and head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed that nociceptive stimulation by tail pinch excited LHb and LH neurons, which was inhibited by chemical lesion of the LH. Tail pinch increased activity of GABA neurons in ventral tegmental area, decreased the extracellular DA level in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell in intact rats, and reduced cocaine-increased DA concentration, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 22 and 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH&ndash;LHb pathway. Our findings suggest that nociceptive stimulation recruits the LH&ndash;LHb pathway to inhibit mesolimbic DA system and drug reinstatement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The LHb and the LH have been implicated in processing nociceptive signals and modulating DA release in the mesolimbic DA system. Here, we show that the LH&ndash;LHb pathway is critical for nociception-induced modulation of mesolimbic DA release and cocaine reinstatement. Nociceptive stimulation alleviates extracellular DA release in the mesolimbic DA system, cocaine-induced psychomotor activities, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviors through the LH&ndash;LHb pathway. These findings provide novel evidence for sensory modulation of the mesolimbic DA system and drug addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathological Slow-Wave Activity and Impaired Working Memory Binding in Post-Traumatic Amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Associative binding is key to normal memory function and is transiently disrupted during periods of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Electrophysiological abnormalities, including low-frequency activity, are common following TBI. Here, we investigate associative memory binding during PTA and test the hypothesis that misbinding is caused by pathological slowing of brain activity disrupting cortical communication. Thirty acute moderate to severe TBI patients (25 males; 5 females) and 26 healthy controls (20 males; 6 females) were tested with a precision working memory paradigm requiring the association of object and location information. Electrophysiological effects of TBI were assessed using resting-state EEG in a subsample of 17 patients and 21 controls. PTA patients showed abnormalities in working memory function and made significantly more misbinding errors than patients who were not in PTA and controls. The distribution of localization responses was abnormally biased by the locations of nontarget items for patients in PTA, suggesting a specific impairment of object and location binding. Slow-wave activity was increased following TBI. Increases in the -&alpha; ratio indicative of an increase in low-frequency power specifically correlated with binding impairment in working memory. Connectivity changes in TBI did not correlate with binding impairment. Working memory and electrophysiological abnormalities normalized at 6 month follow-up. These results show that patients in PTA show high rates of misbinding that are associated with a pathological shift toward lower-frequency oscillations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we remember what was where? The mechanism by which information (e.g., object and location) is integrated in working memory is a central question for cognitive neuroscience. Following significant head injury, many patients will experience a period of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) during which this associative binding is disrupted. This may be because of electrophysiological changes in the brain. Using a precision working memory test and resting-state EEG, we show that PTA patients demonstrate impaired binding ability, and this is associated with a shift toward slower-frequency activity on EEG. Abnormal EEG connectivity was observed but was not specific to PTA or binding ability. These findings contribute to both our mechanistic understanding of working memory binding and PTA pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Seeing Social: A Neural Signature for Conscious Perception of Social Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions&mdash;that is, whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction&mdash;are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of subjective (or conscious) social perception using data from the Human Connectome Project in which participants (<I>n</I> = 1049; 486 men, 562 women) viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers' own reports of "Social" or "Non-social" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as "Social" by some but "Non-social" by others to control for visual input. Behaviorally, observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (vs non-social); and neurally, observer reports (compared with experimenter labels) explained more variance in activity across much of the brain. Using "Unsure" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus non-social content diverged early in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Finally, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias toward "Social" and an inverse relationship with activity in default mode and visual association areas while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Simple animations involving two or more geometric shapes have been used as a gold standard to understand social cognition and impairments therein. Yet, experimenter-assigned labels of what is social versus non-social are frequently used as a ground truth, despite the fact that percepts of such ambiguous social stimuli are highly subjective. Here, we used behavioral and fMRI data from a large sample of neurotypical individuals to show that participants' responses reveal subtle behavioral biases, help us study neural responses to social content more precisely, and covary with internalizing trait scores. Our findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of considering observer reports in studying behavioral and neural dynamics of social perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Environment Symmetry Drives a Multidirectional Code in Rat Retrosplenial Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>We investigated how environment symmetry shapes the neural processing of direction by recording directionally tuned retrosplenial neurons in male Lister hooded rats exploring multicompartment environments that had different levels of global rotational symmetry. Our hypothesis built on prior observations of twofold symmetry in the directional tuning curves of rats in a globally twofold-symmetric environment. To test whether environment symmetry was the relevant factor shaping the directional responses, here we deployed the same apparatus (two connected rectangular boxes) plus one with fourfold symmetry (a 2 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 2 array of connected square boxes) and one with onefold symmetry (a circular open-field arena). Consistent with our hypothesis we found many neurons with tuning curve symmetries that mirrored these environment symmetries, having twofold, fourfold, or onefold symmetric tuning, respectively. Some cells expressed this pattern only globally (across the whole environment), maintaining singular tuning curves in each subcompartment. However, others also expressed it locally within each subcompartment. Because multidirectionality has not been reported in naive rats in single environmental compartments, this suggests an experience-dependent effect of global environment symmetry on local firing symmetry. An intermingled population of directional neurons were classic head direction cells with globally referenced directional tuning. These cells were electrophysiologically distinct, with narrower tuning curves and a burstier firing pattern. Thus, retrosplenial directional neurons can simultaneously encode overall head direction and local head direction (relative to compartment layout). Furthermore, they can learn about global environment symmetry and express this locally. This may be important for the encoding of environment structure beyond immediate perceptual reach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated how environment symmetry shapes the neural code for space by recording directionally tuned neurons from the retrosplenial cortex of rats exploring single- or multicompartment environments having onefold, twofold, or fourfold rotational symmetry. We found that many cells expressed a symmetry in their head direction tuning curves that matched the corresponding global environment symmetry, indicating plasticity of their directional tuning. They were also electrophysiologically distinct from canonical head directional cells. Notably, following exploration of the global space, many multidirectionally tuned neurons encoded global environment symmetry, even in local subcompartments. Our results suggest that multidirectional head direction codes contribute to the cognitive mapping of the complex structure of multicompartmented spaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attention to Stimuli of Learned versus Innate Biological Value Relies on Separate Neural Systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural bases of attention, a set of neural processes that promote behavioral selection, is a subject of intense investigation. In humans, rewarded cues influence attention, even when those cues are irrelevant to the current task. Because the amygdala plays a role in reward processing, and the activity of amygdala neurons has been linked to spatial attention, we reasoned that the amygdala may be essential for attending to rewarded images. To test this possibility, we used an attentional capture task, which provides a quantitative measure of attentional bias. Specifically, we compared reaction times (RTs) of adult male rhesus monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions and unoperated controls as they made a saccade away from a high- or low-value rewarded image to a peripheral target. We predicted that: (1) RTs will be longer for high- compared with low-value images, revealing attentional capture by rewarded stimuli; and (2) relative to controls, monkeys with amygdala lesions would exhibit shorter RT for high-value images. For comparison, we assessed the same groups of monkeys for attentional capture by images of predators and conspecifics, categories thought to have innate biological value. In performing the attentional capture task, all monkeys were slowed more by high-value relative to low-value rewarded images. Contrary to our prediction, amygdala lesions failed to disrupt this effect. When presented with images of predators and conspecifics, however, monkeys with amygdala lesions showed significantly diminished attentional capture relative to controls. Thus, separate neural pathways are responsible for allocating attention to stimuli with learned versus innate value.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Valuable objects attract attention. The amygdala is known to contribute to reward processing and the encoding of object reward value. We therefore examined whether the amygdala is necessary for allocating attention to rewarded objects. For comparison, we assessed the amygdala's contribution to attending to objects with innate biological value: predators and conspecifics. We found that the macaque amygdala is necessary for directing attention to images with innate biological value, but not for directing attention to recently learned reward-predictive images. These findings indicate that the amygdala makes selective contributions to attending to valuable objects. The data are relevant to mental health disorders, such as social anxiety disorders and small animal phobias, that arise from biased attention to select categories of objects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin and APP Regulate Synaptic Kainate Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Kainate receptors (KARs) form a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors that regulate the activity of neuronal networks by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (APP/PS1) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with -secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP. Overall, our data suggest that APP stabilizes KARs at synapses, possibly through a transsynaptic mechanism, and this interaction is under the control the -secretase proteolytic activity of presenilin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic impairment correlates strongly with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. Kainate receptors (KARs), which form the third family of iGluRs, represent an underestimated actor in the regulation of neuronal circuits and have not yet been examined in the context of AD. Here we provide evidence that synaptic KARs are markedly impaired in a mouse model of AD. Additional experiments indicate that the -secretase activity of presenilin acting on the amyloid precursor protein controls synaptic expression of KAR. This study clearly indicates that KARs should be taken into consideration whenever addressing synaptic dysfunction and related cognitive deficits in the context of AD.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In this study, we generated a transgenic model by crossing germline Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice with PolgA<sup>D257A</sup> mice, an established model of premature aging and mitochondrial stress. We hypothesized that loss of Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> in PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice would exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to loss of dopamine neurons and nigral-striatal specific neurobehavioral motor dysfunction. We found that aged Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> male and female mice exhibited severe behavioral deficits, nonspecific to the nigral-striatal pathway, with neither dopaminergic neurodegeneration nor reductions in striatal dopamine. We saw no difference in expression levels of nuclear-encoded subunits of mitochondrial markers and mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities, although we did observe substantial reductions in mitochondrial-encoded COX41I, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a result of PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mtDNA mutations. Expression levels of mitophagy markers LC3I/LC3II remained unchanged between cohorts, suggesting no overt mitophagy defects. Expression levels of the parkin substrates, VDAC, NLRP3, and AIMP2 remained unchanged, suggesting no parkin dysfunction. In summary, we were unable to observe dopaminergic neurodegeneration with corresponding nigral-striatal neurobehavioral deficits, nor Parkin or mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice. These findings support a lack of synergism of Parkin loss on mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of mitochondrial deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Producing a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is etiologically relevant, recapitulates clinical hallmarks, and exhibits reproducible results is crucial to understanding the underlying pathology and in developing disease-modifying therapies. Here, we show that Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice, a previously reported PD mouse model, fails to reproduce a Parkinsonian phenotype. We show that these mice do not display dopaminergic neurodegeneration nor nigral-striatal-dependent motor deficits. Furthermore, we report that Parkin loss does not synergize with mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice are not a reliable model for PD and adds to a growing body of work demonstrating that Parkin loss does not synergize with mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of mitochondrial deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decreased Modulation of Population Correlations in Auditory Cortex Is Associated with Decreased Auditory Detection Performance in Old Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) affects one-third of the world's population. One hallmark of presbycusis is difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Presbycusis can be separated into two components: the aging ear and the aging brain. To date, the role of the aging brain in presbycusis is not well understood. Activity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) during a behavioral task is because of a combination of responses representing the acoustic stimuli, attentional gain, and behavioral choice. Disruptions in any of these aspects can lead to decreased auditory processing. To investigate how these distinct components are disrupted in aging, we performed <I>in vivo</I> 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in both male and female mice (<I>Thy1-GCaMP6s</I> <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> <I>CBA/CaJ</I> mice) that retain peripheral hearing into old age. We imaged A1 neurons of young adult (2-6 months) and old mice (16-24 months) during a tone detection task in broadband noise. While young mice performed well, old mice performed worse at low signal-to-noise ratios. Calcium imaging showed that old animals have increased prestimulus activity, reduced attentional gain, and increased noise correlations. Increased correlations in old animals exist regardless of cell tuning and behavioral outcome, and these correlated networks exist over a much larger portion of cortical space. Neural decoding techniques suggest that this prestimulus activity is predictive of old animals making early responses. Together, our results suggest a model in which old animals have higher and more correlated prestimulus activity and cannot fully suppress this activity, leading to the decreased representation of targets among distracting stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging inhibits the ability to hear clearly in noisy environments. We show that the aging auditory cortex is unable to fully suppress its responses to background noise. During an auditory behavior, fewer neurons were suppressed in the old relative to young animals, which leads to higher prestimulus activity and more false alarms. We show that this excess activity additionally leads to increased correlations between neurons, reducing the amount of relevant stimulus information in the auditory cortex. Future work identifying the lost circuits that are responsible for proper background suppression could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies to preserve auditory processing ability into old age.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of cytosine conversion methods for whole-genome DNA methylation profiling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: DNA methylation, the most common epigenetic modification, is defined as the removal or addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases. Studying DNA methylation provides insight into the regulation of gene expression, transposon mobility, genomic stability, and genomic imprinting. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling (WGDM) is a powerful tool to find DNA methylation. This technique combines standard whole-genome sequencing methodology (e.g., Illumina high-throughput sequencing) with additional steps where unmethylated cytosine is converted to uracil. However, factors such as low cytosine conversion efficiency and inadequate DNA recovery during sample preparation oftentimes render poor-quality data. It is therefore imperative to benchmark sample preparation protocols to increase sequencing data quality and reduce false positives in methylation detection. Methods: A survey analysis was performed to investigate the efficiency of the following commercially available cytosine conversion kits when coupled with the NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB): Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation™ kit (hereafter known as Zymo Conversion kit), QIAGEN EpiTect Bisulfite kit (hereafter known as QIAGEN Conversion kit), and NEBNext® Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module (hereafter known as NEB EM-seq kit). Input DNA was derived from soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) leaf tissue. Results: Of those tested, the QIAGEN Conversion kit provided the best sample recovery and the highest number of sequencing reads, whereas the Zymo Conversion kit had the best cytosine conversion efficiency and the least duplication. The sequence library obtained with the NEB EM-seq kit had the highest mapping efficiency (percentage of reads mapped to the genome). The data quality (defined by Phred score) and methylated cytosine call were similar between kits. Conclusions: This study offers the groundwork for selecting an effective DNA methylation detection kit for crop genome research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors and mortality outcomes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli bacteremia: A retrospective cohort study from two Indonesian referral hospitals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) can lead to bloodstream infection and subsequent sepsis which increases morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of risk factors of infection by ESBL-producing E. coli is important as it can decrease inappropriate antibiotic use and mortality rates. This study aimed to identify the risk factors and mortality of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included inpatients with confirmed E. coli blood culture examinations from two referral hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data suspected as risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia (utilization of medical devices, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, history of hospitalization, and history of antibiotic therapy) were collected for analysis. Clinical profiles and independent risk factors of ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia associated mortality were also evaluated. Results: A total of 116 subjects were analyzed with 81% aged ≥18 years old. The most common source of infection was the gastrointestinal and intra-abdominal tracts. Malignancy as comorbidity was present in 46.6% subjects. Significant risk factors for developing ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia were history of antibiotic therapy and utilization of medical devices. The proportion of mortality in ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia was 55.7% with age and sepsis as its independent risk factors. Conclusions: History of antibiotic therapy and utilization of medical devices were significant risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia. The proportion of mortality in ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia patients was 55.7% with its independent risk factors being age and sepsis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis led by empagliflozin: A case report and literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of medications that have been approved for the treatment of heart failure (HF) in patients with and without type-2 diabetes mellitus. It is important to be aware of the likely side effects of SGLT2i for their optimal use and enhanced patient safety. One such rare but potential side effect is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA). Objective: We present a case report of EDKA, in a patient who was started on empagliflozin – one of the SGLT2i – highlighting its presenting signs and symptoms, pertinent laboratory findings, differential diagnosis, treatment and outcome. To strengthen our findings and hypothesis, we conducted a literature review of other cases that used SGLT2i and found similar complications. This case report with review can help recognize the serious, potentially life-threatening complications of the new class of medication SGLT2i that has been incorporated into the current practice, and also help to take appropriate steps to mitigate its adverse effects and improve overall health outcomes in our patients.  Conclusions: SGLT2i are increasingly used because of their favorable effects on mortality in the chronic HF patients along with its benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. A potential underdiagnosed adverse effect of SGLT2i use is diabetic ketoacidosis in a setting of normal blood glucose levels. Thus, it is reasonable to be cognizant of its side effects to prevent any untoward events in a timely manner.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainability of quality of life investments based on the digital transformation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this paper, the problem of sustainability of investment activity in the direction of the high yield investment program is considered. In these financial instruments, large amounts of money are accumulated, consisting of contributions from the vast majority of the population. For example, pension funds inherent in most developed countries, insurance institutions, etc., can be indicated. Accordingly, the social significance of their activities and the impact on the quality of life of all segments of the population increase. Methods: This article outlines the methods and results aimed at the digital transformation of methods for forecasting long-term institutional investments. The authors use the method of mathematical modeling of the dynamics considering that the sustainability calculation must assume that the life cycle of citizens providing contributions is limited. The parameters of the distribution of the duration of the accumulation phase over the array of people and the time of life in the subsequent period are known. For mathematical modeling, the researchers divide the players by the time they have been present on the market. Results: The authors have developed a mathematical model in the form of a set of algorithms for calculating the sustainability of long-term institutional investments with reference to life quality indicators. Conclusions: The need to develop a methodology for assessing sustainability is dictated by the increased role of digital technologies and the ability to receive the most relevant information for analysis online.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian nowcasting with leading indicators applied to COVID-19 fatalities in Sweden</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fanny Bergström, Felix Günther, Michael Höhle, Tom Britton</p>

The real-time analysis of infectious disease surveillance data is essential in obtaining situational awareness about the current dynamics of a major public health event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis of e.g., time-series of reported cases or fatalities is complicated by reporting delays that lead to under-reporting of the complete number of events for the most recent time points. This can lead to misconceptions by the interpreter, for instance the media or the public, as was the case with the time-series of reported fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Nowcasting methods provide real-time estimates of the complete number of events using the incomplete time-series of currently reported events and information about the reporting delays from the past. In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian nowcasting approach applied to COVID-19-related fatalities in Sweden. We incorporate additional information in the form of time-series of number of reported cases and ICU admissions as leading signals. We demonstrate with a retrospective evaluation that the inclusion of ICU admissions as a leading signal improved the nowcasting performance of case fatalities for COVID-19 in Sweden compared to existing methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Population coding strategies in human tactile afferents</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulia Corniani, Miguel A. Casal, Stefano Panzeri, Hannes P. Saal</p>

Sensory information is conveyed by populations of neurons, and coding strategies cannot always be deduced when considering individual neurons. Moreover, information coding depends on the number of neurons available and on the composition of the population when multiple classes with different response properties are available. Here, we study population coding in human tactile afferents by employing a recently developed simulator of mechanoreceptor firing activity. First, we highlight the interplay of afferents within each class. We demonstrate that the optimal afferent density to convey maximal information depends on both the tactile feature under consideration and the afferent class. Second, we find that information is spread across different classes for all tactile features and that each class encodes both redundant and complementary information with respect to the other afferent classes. Specifically, combining information from multiple afferent classes improves information transmission and is often more efficient than increasing the density of afferents from the same class. Finally, we examine the importance of temporal and spatial contributions, respectively, to the joint spatiotemporal code. On average, destroying temporal information is more destructive than removing spatial information, but the importance of either depends on the stimulus feature analysed. Overall, our results suggest that both optimal afferent innervation densities and the composition of the population depend in complex ways on the tactile features in question, potentially accounting for the variety in which tactile peripheral populations are assembled in different regions across the body.

                <p>by Branden J. Olson, Stefan A. Schattgen, Paul G. Thomas, Philip Bradley, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

The complexity of entire T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires makes their comparison a difficult but important task. Current methods of TCR repertoire comparison can incur a high loss of distributional information by considering overly simplistic sequence- or repertoire-level characteristics. Optimal transport methods form a suitable approach for such comparison given some distance or metric between values in the sample space, with appealing theoretical and computational properties. In this paper we introduce a nonparametric approach to comparing empirical TCR repertoires that applies the Sinkhorn distance, a fast, contemporary optimal transport method, and a recently-created distance between TCRs called TCRdist. We show that our methods identify meaningful differences between samples from distinct TCR distributions for several case studies, and compete with more complicated methods despite minimal modeling assumptions and a simpler pipeline.

                <p>by Marion F. S. Fischer, James E. Crowe, Jens Meiler</p>

Antibody epitope mapping of viral proteins plays a vital role in understanding immune system mechanisms of protection. In the case of class I viral fusion proteins, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and protein stabilization techniques have highlighted the importance of cryptic or ‘alternative’ conformations that expose epitopes targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies. Thorough epitope mapping of such metastable conformations is difficult but is critical for understanding sites of vulnerability in class I fusion proteins that occur as transient conformational states during viral attachment and fusion. We introduce a novel method Accelerated class I fusion protein Epitope Mapping (AxIEM) that accounts for fusion protein flexibility to improve out-of-sample prediction of discontinuous antibody epitopes. Harnessing data from previous experimental epitope mapping efforts of several class I fusion proteins, we demonstrate that accuracy of epitope prediction depends on residue environment and allows for the prediction of conformation-dependent antibody target residues. We also show that AxIEM can identify common epitopes and provide structural insights for the development and rational design of vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pannexin 1 activity in astroglia sets hippocampal neuronal network patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Flora Vasile, Elena Dossi, Julien Moulard, Pascal Ezan, Laure Lecoin, Martine Cohen-Salmon, Philippe Mailly, Marc Le Bert, Isabelle Couillin, Alexis Bemelmans, Nathalie Rouach</p>

Astroglial release of molecules is thought to actively modulate neuronal activity, but the nature, release pathway, and cellular targets of these neuroactive molecules are still unclear. Pannexin 1, expressed by neurons and astrocytes, form nonselective large pore channels that mediate extracellular exchange of molecules. The functional relevance of these channels has been mostly studied in brain tissues, without considering their specific role in different cell types, or in neurons. Thus, our knowledge of astroglial pannexin 1 regulation and its control of neuronal activity remains very limited, largely due to the lack of tools targeting these channels in a cell-specific way. We here show that astroglial pannexin 1 expression in mice is developmentally regulated and that its activation is activity-dependent. Using astrocyte-specific molecular tools, we found that astroglial-specific pannexin 1 channel activation, in contrast to pannexin 1 activation in all cell types, selectively and negatively regulates hippocampal networks, with their disruption inducing a drastic switch from bursts to paroxysmal activity. This decrease in neuronal excitability occurs via an unconventional astroglial mechanism whereby pannexin 1 channel activity drives purinergic signaling-mediated regulation of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN)-gated channels. Our findings suggest that astroglial pannexin 1 channel activation serves as a negative feedback mechanism crucial for the inhibition of hippocampal neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An open label, single arm, pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of daily fluconazole 150 mg in subjects suffering from Tinea cruris and Tinea corporis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dermatophytes are the most common superficial fungal infections worldwide and are treated with prescribed regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, or with weekly doses of fluconazole. Dermatologists are increasingly encountering treatment failures, and experts suggest that standard treatment regimens are not applicable anymore. We planned an open-label study to evaluate the results of fluconazole 150 mg daily for 8 weeks in patients with tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Methods: Patients were enrolled from the La’Mer Clinic, Mumbai, India. We included adult subjects with uncomplicated dermatophytosis confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Pregnancy, poor renal function, and recent exposure to anti-fungal therapy were exclusion criteria. Patients were reviewed on days 14, 28 and 56. The treating doctor scored the severity of erythema, scaling, and pruritus on a four-point scale: absent, mild, moderate, and severe. Of 107 subjects screened, 100 were finally included in the study. Eleven were lost to follow up and one subject withdrew consent. Results: The site of disease was body alone in 29, groin alone in 7, and both body and groin in 64 cases. At 5 weeks, 98%, 100%, and 97% of patients had no scaling, erythema, and pruritus, respectively. Skin scrapings showed 100% mycological cure. In one patient the alanine transaminase level rose from 54.9 to 100.2 U/L, and qualified as a grade 1 adverse event not requiring intervention. No other significant adverse events were noted. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fluconazole 150 mg daily for eight weeks effectively treats dermatophytosis. This regimen is safe and well-tolerated even in patients with co-morbidities. Fluconazole is about eight times less expensive than itraconazole or terbinafine and may be the preferred therapy. Registration: The trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry, India (Registration number CTRI/2020/06/026110) on 24 June 2020. FDC Company, India, provided financial support for the study.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Destabilizers of the thymidylate synthase homodimer accelerate its proteasomal degradation and inhibit cancer growth</a></h4>

              
                Drugs that target human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a dimeric enzyme, are widely used in anti-cancer therapy. However, treatment with classical substrate-site-directed TS inhibitors induces over-expression of this protein and development of drug resistance. We thus pursued an alternative strategy that led us to the discovery of TS-dimer destabilizers. These compounds bind at the monomer-monomer interface and shift the dimerization equilibrium of both the recombinant and the intracellular protein toward the inactive monomers. A structural, spectroscopic, and kinetic investigation has provided evidence and quantitative information on the effects of the interaction of these small molecules with hTS. Focusing on the best among them, E7, we have shown that it inhibits hTS in cancer cells and accelerates its proteasomal degradation, thus causing a decrease in the enzyme intracellular level. E7 also showed a superior anticancer profile to fluorouracil in a mouse model of human pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Thus, over sixty years after the discovery of the first TS prodrug inhibitor, fluorouracil, E7 breaks the link between TS inhibition and enhanced expression in response, providing a strategy to fight drug-resistant cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oncogene expression from extrachromosomal DNA is driven by copy number amplification and does not require spatial clustering in glioblastoma stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) are frequently observed in human cancers and are responsible for high levels of oncogene expression. In glioblastoma (GBM), ecDNA copy number correlates with poor prognosis. It is hypothesized that their copy number, size, and chromatin accessibility facilitate clustering of ecDNA and colocalization with transcriptional hubs, and that this underpins their elevated transcriptional activity. Here, we use super-resolution imaging and quantitative image analysis to evaluate GBM stem cells harbouring distinct ecDNA species (<i>EGFR, CDK4, PDGFRA</i>). We find no evidence that ecDNA routinely cluster with one another or closely interact with transcriptional hubs. Cells with <i>EGFR</i>-containing ecDNA have increased <i>EGFR</i> transcriptional output, but transcription per gene copy is similar in ecDNA compared to the endogenous chromosomal locus. These data suggest that it is the increased copy number of oncogene-harbouring ecDNA that primarily drives high levels of oncogene transcription, rather than specific interactions of ecDNA with each other or with high concentrations of the transcriptional machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Weakly migratory metastatic breast cancer cells activate fibroblasts via microvesicle-Tg2 to facilitate dissemination and metastasis</a></h4>

              
                Cancer cell migration is highly heterogeneous, and the migratory capability of cancer cells is thought to be an indicator of metastatic potential. It is becoming clear that a cancer cell does not have to be inherently migratory to metastasize, with weakly migratory cancer cells often found to be highly metastatic. However, the mechanism through which weakly migratory cells escape from the primary tumor remains unclear. Here, utilizing phenotypically sorted highly and weakly migratory human breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that weakly migratory metastatic cells disseminate from the primary tumor via communication with stromal cells. While highly migratory cells are capable of single cell migration, weakly migratory cells rely on cell-cell signaling with fibroblasts to escape the primary tumor. Weakly migratory cells release microvesicles rich in tissue transglutaminase 2 (Tg2) which activate murine fibroblasts and lead weakly migratory cancer cell migration <i>in vitro</i>. These microvesicles also induce tumor stiffening and fibroblast activation <i>in vivo</i> and enhance the metastasis of weakly migratory cells. Our results identify microvesicles and Tg2 as potential therapeutic targets for metastasis and reveal a novel aspect of the metastatic cascade in which weakly migratory cells release microvesicles which activate fibroblasts to enhance cancer cell dissemination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rostral and caudal BLA engage distinct circuits in the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC</a></h4>

              
                Connections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate memory and emotion and become disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders. The diverse roles attributed to interactions between the BLA and PFC may reflect multiple circuits nested within a wider network. To examine these circuits, we first used retrograde and anterograde anatomy to show that the rostral BLA (rBLA) and caudal BLA (cBLA) differentially project to prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the mouse PFC. Using <i>ex vivo</i> whole-cell recordings and optogenetics, we then assessed which neuronal subtypes are targeted, showing that rBLA preferentially drives layer 2 (L2) cortico-amygdalar (CA) neurons in PL, whereas cBLA drives layer 5 (L5) pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in IL. We next combined <i>in vivo</i> silicon probe recordings and optogenetics to confirm that cBLA mainly influences IL L5, whereas rBLA primarily activates PL L2, but also evokes polysynaptic activity in PL L5. Lastly, we used soma-tagged optogenetics to explore the local circuits linking superficial and deep layers of PL, showing how rBLA can engage L2 CA neurons to impact L5 PT neuron activity. Together, our findings delineate how subregions of the BLA target distinct networks within the PFC and differentially influence output from PL and IL.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Doublecortin and JIP3 are neural-specific counteracting regulators of dynein-mediated retrograde trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the microtubule (MT)-binding protein doublecortin (DCX) or in the MT-based molecular motor dynein result in lissencephaly. However, a functional link between DCX and dynein has not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that DCX negatively regulates dynein-mediated retrograde transport in neurons from <i>Dcx<sup>-/y</sup></i> or <i>Dcx<sup>-/y</sup>;Dclk1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice by reducing dynein's association with MTs and by disrupting the composition of the dynein motor complex. Previous work showed an increased binding of the adaptor protein C-Jun-amino-terminal kinase-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) to dynein in the absence of DCX. Using purified components, we demonstrate that JIP3 forms an active motor complex with dynein and its cofactor dynactin with two dyneins per complex. DCX competes with the binding of the second dynein, resulting in a velocity reduction of the complex. We conclude that DCX negatively regulates dynein-mediated retrograde transport through two critical interactions by regulating dynein binding to MTs and by regulating the composition of the dynein motor complex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">eDNA-stimulated cell dispersion from Caulobacter crescentus biofilms upon oxygen limitation is dependent on a toxin-antitoxin system</a></h4>

              
                In their natural environment, most bacteria preferentially live as complex surface-attached multicellular colonies called biofilms. Biofilms begin with a few cells adhering to a surface, where they multiply to form a mature colony. When conditions deteriorate, cells can leave the biofilm. This dispersion is thought to be an important process that modifies the overall biofilm architecture and that promotes colonization of new environments. In <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> biofilms, extracellular DNA (eDNA) is released upon cell death and prevents newborn cells from joining the established biofilm. Thus, eDNA promotes the dispersal of newborn cells and the subsequent colonization of new environments. These observations suggest that eDNA is a cue for sensing detrimental environmental conditions in the biofilm. Here we show that the toxin-antitoxin system (TAS) ParDE<sub>4</sub> stimulates cell death in areas of a biofilm with decreased O<sub>2</sub> availability. In conditions where O<sub>2</sub> availability is low, eDNA concentration is correlated with cell death. Cell dispersal away from biofilms is decreased when <i>parDE<sub>4</sub></i> is deleted, probably due to the lower local eDNA concentration. Expression of <i>parDE<sub>4</sub></i> is positively regulated by O<sub>2</sub> and the expression of this operon is decreased in biofilms where O<sub>2</sub> availability is low. Thus, a programmed cell death mechanism using an O<sub>2</sub>-regulated TAS stimulates dispersal away from areas of a biofilm with decreased O<sub>2</sub> availability and favors colonization of a new, more hospitable environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Overcoming the cytoplasmic retention of GDOWN1 modulates global transcription and facilitates stress adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic regulation of transcription is crucial for the cellular responses to various environmental or developmental cues. Gdown1 is a ubiquitously expressed, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) interacting protein, essential for the embryonic development of metazoan. It tightly binds Pol II <i>in vitro</i> and competitively blocks the binding of TFIIF and possibly other transcriptional regulatory factors, yet its cellular functions and regulatory circuits remain unclear. Here, we show that human GDOWN1 strictly localizes in the cytoplasm of various types of somatic cells and exhibits a potent resistance to the imposed driving force for its nuclear localization. Combined with the genetic and microscope-based approaches, two types of the functionally coupled and evolutionally conserved localization regulatory motifs are identified, including the CRM1-dependent nucleus export signal (NES) and a novel Cytoplasmic Anchoring Signal (CAS) that mediates its retention outside of the nuclear pore complexes (NPC). Mutagenesis of CAS alleviates GDOWN1’s cytoplasmic retention, thus unlocks its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties, and the increased nuclear import and accumulation of GDOWN1 results in a drastic reduction of both Pol II and its associated global transcription levels. Importantly, the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1 occurs in response to the oxidative stresses, and the ablation of <i>GDOWN1</i> significantly weakens the cellular tolerance. Collectively, our work uncovers the molecular basis of GDOWN1’s subcellular localization and a novel cellular strategy of modulating global transcription and stress-adaptation via controlling the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA damage independent inhibition of NF-kB transcription by anthracyclines</a></h4>

              
                Anthracyclines are among the most used and effective anticancer drugs. Their activity has been attributed to DNA double-strand breaks resulting from topoisomerase II poisoning and to eviction of histones from select sites in the genome. Here we show that the extensively used anthracyclines Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin and Epirubicin decrease the transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent gene targets, but not interferon responsive genes in primary mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) macrophages. Using an NMR-based structural approach, we demonstrate that anthracyclines disturb the complexes formed between the NF-kB subunit RelA and its DNA binding sites. The anthracycline variants Aclarubicin, Doxorubicinone and the newly developed Dimethyl-doxorubicin, which share anticancer properties with the other anthracyclines but do not induce DNA damage, also suppressed inflammation, thus uncoupling DNA damage from the effects on inflammation. These findings have implications for anticancer therapy and for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs with limited side effects for life-threatening conditions such as sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A method for low-coverage single-gamete sequence analysis demonstrates adherence to Mendel's first law across a large sample of human sperm</a></h4>

              
                Recently published single-cell sequencing data from individual human sperm (n = 41,189; 969-3,377 cells from each of 25 donors) offer an opportunity to investigate questions of inheritance with improved statistical power, but require new methods tailored to these extremely low-coverage data (∼0.01 x per cell). To this end, we developed a method, named rhapsodi, that leverages sparse gamete genotype data to phase the diploid genomes of the donor individuals, impute missing gamete genotypes, and discover meiotic recombination breakpoints, benchmarking its performance across a wide range of study designs. Mendel's Law of Segregation states that the offspring of a diploid, heterozygous parent will inherit either allele with equal probability. While the vast majority of loci adhere to this rule, research in model and non-model organisms has uncovered numerous exceptions whereby 'selfish' alleles are disproportionately transmitted to the next generation. Evidence of such 'transmission distortion' (TD) in humans remains equivocal in part because scans of human pedigrees have been under-powered to detect small effects. After applying rhapsodi to the sperm sequencing data, we therefore scanned the gametes for evidence of TD. Our results exhibited close concordance with binomial expectations under balanced transmission. Together, our work demonstrates that rhapsodi can facilitate novel uses of inferred genotype data and meiotic recombination events, while offering a powerful quantitative framework for testing for TD in other cohorts and study systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The NAD+ precursor NMN activates dSarm to trigger axon degeneration in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration contributes to the disruption of neuronal circuit function in diseased and injured nervous systems. Severed axons degenerate following the activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the metabolite NAD<sup>+</sup>. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently preserves axons after injury. However, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a key mediator of axon degeneration and dSarm activation in flies. Here, we demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in <i>Drosophila</i> through the expression of a newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD<sup>+</sup> remains unchanged <i>in vivo</i>. Increased NMN synthesis, by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (mNAMPT), leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration <i>in vivo</i>. Finally, NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in neurodegeneration in the fly, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar to the interference with other essential mediators of axon degeneration in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inductive biases of neural networks for generalization in spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                Artificial reinforcement learning agents that perform well in training tasks typically perform worse than animals in novel tasks. We propose one reason: generalization requires modular architectures like the brain. We trained deep reinforcement learning agents using neural architectures with various degrees of modularity in a partially observable navigation task. We found that highly modular architectures that largely separate computations of internal belief of state from action and value allow better generalization performance than agents with less modular architectures. Furthermore, the modular agent's internal belief is formed by combining prediction and observation, weighted by their relative uncertainty, suggesting that networks learn a Kalman filter-like belief update rule. Therefore, smaller uncertainties in observation than in prediction lead to better generalization to tasks with novel observable dynamics. These results exemplify the rationale of the brain's inductive biases and show how insights from neuroscience can inspire the development of artificial systems with better generalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effectiveness of acellular nerve allografts compared to autografts in animal models: a systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Treatment of nerve injuries proves to be a worldwide clinical challenge. Acellular nerve allografts are suggested to be a promising alternative for bridging a nerve gap to the current gold standard, an autologous nerve graft. Objective: To systematically review the efficacy of the acellular nerve allograft, its difference from the gold standard (the nerve autograft) and to discuss its possible indications. Material and methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched until the 4th of January 2022. Original peer reviewed paper that presented 1) distinctive data; 2) a clear comparison between not immunologically processed acellular allografts and autologous nerve transfers; 3) was performed in laboratory animals of all species and sex. Meta analyses and subgroup analyses (for graft length and species) were conducted for muscle weight, sciatic function index, ankle angle, nerve conduction velocity, axon count diameter, tetanic contraction and amplitude using a Random effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted on graft length and species. Results: Fifty articles were included in this review and all were included in the meta-analyses. An acellular allograft resulted in a significantly lower muscle weight, sciatic function index, ankle angle, nerve conduction velocity, axon count and smaller diameter, tetanic contraction compared to an autologous nerve graft. No difference was found in amplitude between acellular allografts and autologous nerve transfers. Post hoc subgroup analyses of graft length showed a significant reduced muscle weight in long grafts versus small and medium length grafts. All included studies showed a large variance in methodological design. Conclusion: Our review shows that the included studies, investigating the use of acellular allografts, showed a large variance in methodological design and are as a consequence difficult to compare. Nevertheless, our results indicate that treating a nerve gap with an allograft results in an inferior nerve recovery compared to an autograft in seven out of eight outcomes assessed in experimental animals. In addition, based on our preliminary post hoc subgroup analyses we suggest that when an allograft is being used an allograft in short and medium (0-1cm, > 1-2cm) nerve gaps is preferred over an allograft in long (> 2cm) nerve gaps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG error-related potentials encode magnitude of errors and individual perceptual thresholds</a></h4>

              
                Error-related potentials (ErrP) are a prominent electroencephalogram (EEG) correlate of performance monitoring, and so crucial for learning and adapting our behavior. Although there exists an agreement that ErrP signal awareness to errors, it remains poorly understood whether they encode further information. Here we report an experiment with sixteen participants during three recording sessions in which occasional visuomotor rotations of varying magnitude occurred during a cursor reaching task. We designed a brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect ErrP in single trials that provided real-time feedback to participants by changing the color of the cursor upon ErrP detection. The individual ErrP-BCI decoders exhibited good transfer across recording sessions and scalability over the varying magnitude of errors. Our results indicate that ErrPs encode not only the conscious perception of errors, but also their magnitude, in their amplitude and latency. Furthermore, a non-linear relationship between the ErrP-BCI output and the magnitude of errors predicts individual perceptual thresholds to detect rotations. The uncovered relationship is consistent with non-human primate studies, which found a similar relationship between the size of errors and simple spike activity of Purkinje cells, and we conjecture a cerebellar contribution to ErrP. Our experimental setup and findings open new avenues to probe and extend current theories of performance monitoring, which are based on response conflict tasks, by incorporating continuous human-interaction tasks as well as analysis of the ErrP complex as a whole rather than individual peaks.

Significance StatementEEG error-related potentials (ErrP) are a prominent neural correlate of performance monitoring, and so critical for adaptive motor learning. Although there exists an agreement that they signal awareness to errors, little is known about whether ErrP co-varies with the magnitude of errors. We designed a brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect ErrP in real time during a cursor reaching task where visuomotor rotations of varying degrees occurred occasionally. Our results indicate that ErrPs encode not only the conscious perception of errors, but also their magnitude, in their amplitude and latency. Furthermore, analysis of the ErrP-BCI output shows that ErrPs predict individual perceptual thresholds to detect errors. Contrarily to established theories of performance monitoring, we advance a cerebellar contribution to ErrP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Burst firing is required for induction of Hebbian LTP at lateral perforant path to hippocampal granule cell synapses</a></h4>

              
                High frequency burst firing is critical in summation of back-propagating action potentials (APs) in dendrites, which may greatly depolarize dendritic membrane potential. The physiological significance of burst firings of hippocampal dentate GCs in synaptic plasticity remains unknown. We found that GCs with low input resistance could be categorized into regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) cells based on their initial firing frequency (Finit) upon somatic rheobase current injection, and investigated how two types of GCs differ in long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency lateral perforant pathway (LPP) inputs. Induction of Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses required at least three postsynaptic APs at Finit higher than 100 Hz, which was met in BS but not in RS cells. The synaptically evoked burst firing was critically dependent on persistent Na+ current, which was larger in BS than RS cells. The Ca2+ source for Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses was primarily provided by L-type calcium channels. In contrast, Hebbian LTP at medial PP synapses was mediated by T-type calcium channels, and could be induced regardless of cell types or Finit of postsynaptic APs. These results suggest that intrinsic firing properties affect synaptically driven firing patterns, and that bursting behavior differentially affects Hebbian LTP mechanisms depending on the synaptic input pathway.

                Rhythmic entrainment echoes, rhythmic brain responses that outlast rhythmic stimulation, can evidence endogenous neural oscillations entrained by the stimulus rhythm. We here tested for such echoes in auditory perception. Participants detected a pure tone target, presented at a variable delay after another pure tone that was rhythmically modulated in amplitude. In four experiments involving 154 participants, we tested (1) which stimulus rate produces the strongest entrainment echo and (2), inspired by audition's tonotopical organisation and findings in non-human primates, whether these are organized according to sound frequency. We found strongest entrainment echoes after 6-Hz and 8-Hz stimulation, respectively. Best moments for target detection (in or in anti-phase with the preceding rhythm) depended on whether sound frequencies of entraining and target stimuli matched, in line with a tonotopical organisation. However, for the same experimental condition, best moments were not always consistent across experiments. We provide a speculative explanation for these differences that relies on the notion that neural entrainment and repetition-related adaptation might exercise competing, opposite influences on perception. Together, we find rhythmic echoes in auditory perception that seem more complex than those predicted from initial theories of neural entrainment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mega-scale movie-fields in the mouse visuo-hippocampal network</a></h4>

              
                Natural behavior often involves a continuous series of related images, often while the subject is immobile. How is this information processed across the cortico-hippocampal circuit? The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory1-3, but most rodent single unit studies require spatial exploration4-6 or active engagement7. Hence, we investigated neural responses to a silent, iso-luminant, black and white movie in head-fixed mice without any task or locomotion demands, or rewards. The activity of most neurons (97%, 6554/6785) in the thalamo-cortical visual areas was significantly modulated by the 30s long movie clip. Surprisingly, a third (33%, 3379/10263) of hippocampal -dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum- neurons showed movie-selectivity, with elevated firing in specific movie sub-segments, termed movie-fields. On average, a cell had more than 5 movie-fields in visual areas, but only 2 in hippocampal areas. The movie-field durations in all brain regions spanned an unprecedented 1000-fold range: from 0.02s to 20s, termed mega-scale coding. Yet, the total duration of all the movie-fields of a cell was comparable across neurons and brain regions, partly due to broader movie-fields in hippocampal areas, indicating greater sequence coding. Consistently presentation of the movie images in a scrambled sequence virtually abolished hippocampal but not visual-cortical selectivity. The enhancement of sequential movie tuning compared to the scrambled sequence was eight-fold greater in hippocampal than visual areas, further supporting visual sequence encoding. Thus, a movie was encoded in all mouse-brain areas investigated. Similar results are likely to hold in primates and humans. Hence, movies could provide a unified way to probe neural mechanisms of non-spatial information processing and memory across brain regions and species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebral organoids expressing mutant actin genes reveal cellular mechanism underlying microcephalic cortical malformation</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic ACTB and ACTG1 gene variants, encoding the actin isoforms {beta}CYA and{gamma} CYA, respectively, are frequently associated with the Baraitser-Winter-CerebroFrontoFacial syndrome (BWCFF-S) that includes malformations of cortical development. Here we explore whether cerebral organoids grown from BWCFF-S patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells can provide insight into the pathogenesis underlying the cortical malformations of these patients. Cerebral organoids expressing either an ACTB or an ACTG1 gene variant, each with a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution, are reduced in size, showing smaller ventricle-like structures with a thinner ventricular zone (VZ). This decrease in VZ- progenitors is associated with a striking change in the orientation of their cleavage plane from predominantly vertical (control) to predominantly horizontal (BWCFF-S), which is incompatible with increasing VZ-progenitor abundance. The underlying cause appears to be an altered subcellular tubulin localization due to the actin mutations that affects mitotic spindle positioning of VZ-progenitors in BWCFF-S.

                Neural circuit assembly is a multi-step process where synaptic partners are often born at distinct developmental stages, and yet they must find each other and form precise synaptic connections with one another. This developmental process often relies on late-born neurons extending their processes to the appropriate layer to find and make synaptic connections to their early-born targets. The molecular mechanism responsible for the integration of late-born neurons into an emerging neural circuit remains unclear. Here we uncovered a new role for the cytoskeletal protein {beta}II-spectrin in properly positioning pre- and post-synaptic neurons to the developing synaptic layer. Loss of {beta}II-spectrin disrupts retinal lamination, leads to synaptic connectivity defects, and results in impaired visual function. Together, these findings highlight a new function of {beta}II-spectrin in assembling neural circuits in the mouse outer retina.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep restores an optimal computational regime in cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is vitally important for brain function, yet its core process by which brain function is restored remains an open question. Sleep is assumed to subserve brain homeostatic processes; the proper compensatory tuning of circuits is necessary for stable function. Criticality, a computational regime that optimizes information processing capacity, is a homeostatically regulated set-point in isocortical circuits. Criticality is susceptible to degradation by experience-dependent plasticity. Whether criticality is the computational set-point of daily sleep is unknown. To address this question, we evaluated the effects of sleep and wake on emergent, computational dynamics in ensembles of cortical neurons recorded continuously for 10-14 d in freely behaving rats. We show that normal waking experience progressively disrupts criticality, and that sleep functions to restore critical dynamics. Criticality is a universal set-point across animals. We find that criticality is perturbed in a context-dependent manner depending on behavior and environmental variables, and that waking experience is causal in driving these effects. The degree of deviation from criticality is robustly predictive of future behavior. Our results demonstrate that perturbation and recovery of criticality is consistent with a network mechanism at the core of the heuristic Two Process Model, which has been used to describe sleep and wake cycles for 40 years. Summarily, our data suggest that restoration of an optimal computational regime is a key factor in determining why brains sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attention weights accurately predict language representations in the brain</a></h4>

              
                In Transformer-based language models (LMs) the attention mechanism converts token embeddings into contextual embeddings that incorporate information from neighboring words. The resulting contextual hidden state embeddings have enabled highly accurate models of brain responses, suggesting that the attention mechanism constructs contextual embeddings that carry information reflected in language-related brain representations. However, it is unclear whether the attention weights that are used to integrate information across words are themselves related to language representations in the brain. To address this question we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings of participants reading English language narratives. We provided the narrative text as input to two LMs (BERT and GPT-2) and extracted their corresponding attention weights. We then used encoding models to determine how well attention weights can predict recorded brain responses. We find that attention weights accurately predict brain responses in much of the frontal and temporal cortices. Our results suggest that the attention mechanism itself carries information that is reflected in brain representations. Moreover, these results indicate cortical areas in which context integration may occur.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discrete Ricci curvatures capture age-related changes in human brain functional connectivity networks</a></h4>

              
                Geometry-inspired notions of discrete Ricci curvature have been successfully used as markers of disrupted brain connectivity in neuropsychiatric disorders, but their ability to characterize age-related changes in functional connectivity is unexplored. Here, we apply Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature to compare functional connectivity networks of healthy young and older subjects from the Max Planck Institute Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (MPI-LEMON) dataset (N = 225). We found that both Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature can capture whole-brain and region-level age-related differences in functional connectivity. Meta-analysis decoding demonstrated that those brain regions with age-related curvature differences were associated with cognitive domains known to manifest age-related changes - movement, affective processing and somatosensory processing. Moreover, the curvature values of some brain regions showing age-related differences exhibited correlations with behavioral scores of affective processing. Finally, we found an overlap between brain regions showing age-related curvature differences and those brain regions whose non-invasive stimulation resulted in improved movement performance in older adults. These results suggest that both Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature correctly identify brain regions that are known to be functionally or clinically relevant. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the sensitivity of discrete Ricci curvature measures to changes in the organisation of functional connectivity networks, both in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric coding of reward prediction errors in human insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The signed value and unsigned salience of reward prediction errors (RPEs) are critical to understanding reinforcement learning (RL) and cognitive control. Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and insula (INS) are key regions for integrating reward and surprise information, but conflicting evidence for both signed and unsigned activity has led to competing proposals for the nature of RPE representations in these brain areas. Recently, the distributional RL theory (dRL) has been used to explain RPE coding diversity in the rodent midbrain by proposing that dopaminergic neurons have differential sensitivity to positive and negative RPEs. Here, we use intracranially recorded high frequency activity (HFA) to show that this asymmetric scaling strategy captures RPE coding diversity in human dMPFC and INS. We found neural populations responding to valence-specific positive and negative RPEs, as well as unsigned RPE salience, which are spatially interleaved within each region. Furthermore, directional connectivity estimates suggest a leading role of INS in communicating positive and unsigned RPEs to dMPFC. These findings support asymmetric scaling across distinct but intermingled neural populations as a core principle in RPE coding, expand the scope of dRL, and reconcile longstanding theoretical debates on the role of dMPFC and INS in RL and cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trans-cellular control of synapse properties by a cell type-specific splicing regulator</a></h4>

              
                The recognition of synaptic partners and specification of synaptic properties are fundamental for the function of neuronal circuits.  Terminal selector transcription factors coordinate the expression of terminal gene batteries that specify cell type-specific properties. Moreover, pan-neuronal alternative splicing regulators have been implicated in directing neuronal differentiation. However, the cellular logic of how splicing regulators instruct specific synaptic properties remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide mapping of mRNA targets and cell type-specific loss-of-function studies to uncover the contribution of the nuclear RNA binding protein SLM2 to hippocampal synapse specification. Focusing on hippocampal pyramidal cells and SST-positive GABAergic interneurons, we find that SLM2 preferentially binds and regulates alternative splicing of transcripts encoding synaptic proteins, thereby generating cell type-specific isoforms. In the absence of SLM2, cell type-specification, differentiation, and viability are unaltered and neuronal populations exhibit normal intrinsic properties. By contrast, cell type-specific loss of SLM2 results in highly selective, non-cell autonomous synaptic phenotypes, altered synaptic transmission, and associated defects in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. Thus, alternative splicing provides a critical layer of gene regulation that instructs specification of neuronal connectivity in a trans-synaptic manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Controlling the bioelectrical properties of neurons with ferritin-based Magnetogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Magnetogenetics promises remote control of neurons, but its validity is questioned due to controversies surrounding the underlying mechanisms and deficits in reproducibility. Recent studies discovered that ferritin, used in Magnetogenetics, transduces radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields into biochemical signals (reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids). Magnetic stimulation of ferritin-tethered TRPV channels induces Ca2+ responses and modulates behavior but electrophysiological studies indicate that a particular channel, Magneto2.0, is ineffective in affecting the neuronal bioelectrical properties. We investigated this problem using the Magnetogenetic technique FeRIC. We resolved the electromagnetic interference caused by RF in patch-clamp recordings and supported the data with voltage imaging experiments. In neurons expressing TRPV4FeRIC, RF depolarizes the membrane potential and increases the spiking frequency. In neurons expressing the chloride-permeable TMEM16AFeRIC, RF hyperpolarizes the membrane potential and decreases the spiking frequency. Our study reveals the control of neuronal bioelectrical properties with Magnetogenetics that is non-instantaneous, long-lasting, and moderate, but effective and comparable to that induced by endogenous signaling molecules.

                Mutations in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), with a single missense mutation (Asp620Asn, D620N) known to segregate with disease in families with PD. The VPS35 gene encodes a core component of the retromer complex, involved in the endosomal sorting and recycling of transmembrane cargo proteins. VPS35-linked PD is clinically indistinguishable from sporadic PD, although it is not yet known whether VPS35-PD brains exhibit -synuclein-positive brainstem Lewy pathology that is characteristic of sporadic cases. Prior studies have suggested a functional interaction between VPS35 and the PD-linked gene product -synuclein in lower organisms, where VPS35 deletion enhances -synuclein-induced toxicity. In mice, VPS35 overexpression is reported to rescue hippocampal neuronal loss in human -synuclein transgenic mice, potentially suggesting a retromer deficiency in these mice. Here, we employ multiple well-established genetic rodent models to explore a functional or pathological interaction between VPS35 and -synuclein in vivo. We find that endogenous -synuclein is dispensable for nigrostriatal pathway dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by the viral-mediated delivery of human D620N VPS35 in mice, suggesting that -synuclein does not operate downstream of VPS35. We next evaluated retromer levels in affected brain regions from human A53T--synuclein transgenic mice, but find normal levels of the core subunits VPS35, VPS26 or VPS29. We further find that heterozygous VPS35 deletion fails to alter the lethal neurodegenerative phenotype of these A53T--synuclein transgenic mice, suggesting the absence of retromer deficiency in this PD model. Finally, we explored the neuroprotective capacity of increasing VPS35 expression in a viral-based human wild-type -synuclein rat model of PD. However, we find that the overexpression of wild-type VPS35 is not sufficient for protection against -synuclein-induced nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration, -synuclein pathology and reactive gliosis. Collectively, our data suggest a limited interaction of VPS35 and -synuclein in neurodegenerative models of PD, and do not provide support for their interaction within a common pathophysiological pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task learning is subserved by a domain-general brain network</a></h4>

              
                One of the most important human faculties is the ability to acquire not just new memories but the capacity to perform entirely new tasks. However, little is known about the brain mechanisms underlying the learning of novel tasks. Specifically, it is unclear to what extent learning of different tasks depends on domain-general and/or domain-specific brain mechanisms. Here human subjects (N=45) learned to perform six new tasks while undergoing functional MRI. The different tasks required the engagement of perceptual, motor, and various cognitive processes (attention, expectation, speed-accuracy tradeoff, and metacognition). We found that a bilateral frontoparietal network was more active during the initial compared to the later stages of task learning, and that this effect was stronger for task variants requiring more new learning. Critically, the same frontoparietal network was engaged by all six tasks, demonstrating its domain generality. Finally, although task learning decreased the overall activity in the frontoparietal network, it increased the connectivity strength between the different nodes of that network. These results demonstrate the existence of a domain-general brain network whose activity and connectivity reflect learning for a wide variety of new tasks, and thus may underlie the human capacity for acquiring new abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of prefrontal cortex and striatal regions in rats after shifting between rules in a T-maze</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal cortical and striatal areas have been identified by inactivation or lesion studies to be required for behavioral flexibility, including selecting and processing of different types of information. In order to identify these networks activated selectively during acquisition of new reward contingency rules, rats were trained to discriminate orientations of bars presented in pseudo-random sequence on two video monitors positioned behind the goal sites on a T maze with return arms. A second group already trained in the visual discrimination task learned to alternate left and right goal arm visits in the same maze while ignoring the visual cues still being presented. In each experimental group, once the rats reached criterion performance, the brains were prepared after a 90 minute delay, for later processing for c-fos immunohistochemistry. While both groups extinguished a prior strategy and acquired a new rule, they differed by the identity of the strategies, and previous learning experience. Among the 28 forebrain areas examined, there were significant increases in the relative density of c-fos immunoreactive cell bodies after learning the second rule in prefrontal cortex cingulate, prelimbic and infralimbic areas, in dorsomedial striatum and the core of nucleus accumbens, in ventral subiculum, and the central nucleus of the amygdala. These largely correspond to structures anatomically identified by previous inactivation studies. The data suggest that this dynamic network may underlie reward-based selection for action, a type of cognitive flexibility.

                Datasets collected in neuroscientific studies are of ever-growing complexity, often combining high dimensional time series data from multiple data acquisition modalities. Handling and manipulating these various data streams in an adequate programming environment is crucial to ensure reliable analysis, and to facilitate sharing of reproducible analysis pipelines. Here, we present Pynapple, a lightweight python package designed to process a broad range of time-resolved data in systems neuroscience. The core feature of this package is a small number of versatile objects that support the manipulation of any data streams and task parameters. The package includes a set of methods to read common data formats and allows users to easily write their own. The resulting code is easy to read and write, avoids low-level data processing and other error-prone steps, and is fully open source. Libraries for higher-level analyses are developed within the Pynapple framework but are contained within in a collaborative repository of specialized and continuously updated analysis routines. This provides flexibility while ensuring long-term stability of the core package. In conclusion, Pynapple provides a common framework for data analysis in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Redundant representations are required to disambiguate simultaneously presented complex stimuli</a></h4>

              
                An individual observing a barking dog and purring cat together in a field has distinct pairs of representations of the two animals in their visual and auditory systems. Without prior knowledge, how does the observer infer that the dog barks and the cat purrs? This integration of distributed representations is called the assignment problem, and it must be solved to integrate distinct representations across but also within sensory modalities. Here, we identify and analyze a solution to the assignment problem: the representation of one or more common stimulus features in pairs of relevant brain regions -- for example, estimates of the spatial position of both the cat and the dog represented in both the visual and auditory systems. We characterize how the reliability of this solution depends on different features of the stimulus set (e.g., the size of the set and the complexity of the stimuli) and the details of the split representations (e.g., the precision of each stimulus representation and the amount of overlapping information). Next, we implement this solution in a biologically plausible receptive field code and show how constraints on the number of neurons and spikes used by the code force the brain to navigate a tradeoff between local and catastrophic errors. We show that, when many spikes and neurons are available, representing stimuli from a single sensory modality can be done more reliably across multiple brain regions, despite the risk of assignment errors. Finally, we show that a feedforward neural network can learn the optimal solution to the assignment problem. We also discuss relevant results on assignment errors from the human working memory literature and show that several key predictions of our theory already have support.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of random and systematic visual stimulation on entrained infraslow quasi-periodic global waves in human brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Infraslow (<0.1Hz) electric activity, involved in attention and arousal fluctuations, serve as the unique neurophysiological basis for infraslow BOLD fluctuations. Particularly, the dynamics of infraslow electrical activity in both resting and task-performing human brains exhibit a quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) of consistent, phase-locked spatiotemporal BOLD signal changes. However, it is unclear how environmental stimuli affect the infraslow dynamic QPP or how the ongoing infraslow dynamics might modify the response to the environment in awake humans. To investigate this, we presented checkerboard sequences flashing at 8Hz to subjects. This is a salient visual stimulus that is known to produce a strong response in visual processing regions. Three central questions were investigated: 1) how does visual stimulation affect the QPPs compared to rest, 2) how does variability in visual stimulus onset affect the QPPs, and 3) how does the BOLD response to visual stimuli depend on the phases of the QPPs. Two different visual stimulation sequences were employed, a systematic stimulation sequence in which the visual stimulus appeared every 20.3 secs and a random stimulation sequence in which the visual stimulus occurred randomly every 14~62.3 secs. Three central observations emerged. First, the systematic condition produced a different spatiotemporal pattern of infraslow dynamics compared to both the resting-state and the random stimulation conditions. Second, the QPP was more frequent in the systematic condition with significantly shorter intervals between consecutive QPPs compared to the random condition. Third, the BOLD signal response to the visual stimulus across both conditions was swamped by the QPP at the stimulus onset. These results provide novel insights into the relationship between intrinsic patterns and task-evoked brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide oscillatory network selectively encodes aggression</a></h4>

              
                Social aggression is an innate behavior that can aid an organism in securing access to resources. Aggression can also disrupt group function and reduce survival under conditions of behavioral pathology. Since many brain regions contribute to multiple social behaviors, expanded knowledge of how the brain encodes distinct social states would enable the development of interventions that suppress aggression, while leaving other social behaviors intact. Here we show that murine aggression is optimally encoded by a brain-wide network. This network is organized by prominent theta (4-11Hz) and beta (14-30Hz) oscillations, leading from orbital frontal cortex and medial dorsal thalamus, and converging on ventral medial hypothalamus and medial amygdala. Activity in this network is coupled to brain-wide cellular firing, and the network is conserved in new mice from multiple genetic backgrounds, and in multiple contexts. Finally, we develop a closed loop stimulation protocol based on network activity levels. This protocol suppressed aggression, but not pro-social behavior. Thus, we defined a causal brain-wide network that selectively encodes aggressive behavior across mice and established a new approach for state specific control of affective behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A thermodynamical model of non-deterministic computation in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex engage in probabilistic coding, effectively encoding the state of the surrounding environment with high accuracy and extraordinary energy efficiency. A new approach models the inherently probabilistic nature of cortical neuron signaling outcomes as a thermodynamic process of non-deterministic computation. A mean field approach is used, with the trial Hamiltonian maximizing free energy and minimizing the net quantity of temperature-entropy, compared with a reference Hamiltonian. Thermodynamic quantities are always conserved during the computation; free energy must be expended to produce information, and free energy is released during information compression, as correlations are identified between the encoding system and its surrounding environment. Due to the relationship between the Gibbs free energy equation and the Nernst equation, any increase in free energy is paired with a local decrease in membrane potential. As a result, this process of thermodynamic computation adjusts the likelihood of each neuron firing an action potential. This model shows that non-deterministic signaling outcomes can be achieved by noisy cortical neurons, through an energy-efficient computational process that involves optimally redistributing a Hamiltonian over some time evolution. Calculations demonstrate that the energy efficiency of the human brain is consistent with this model of non-deterministic computation, with net entropy production far too low to retain the assumptions of a classical system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling electron interference at the neuronal membrane yields a holographic projection of representative information content</a></h4>

              
                It has historically proven difficult to explain the relationship between neural activity and representative information content. A new approach focuses on the unique properties of cortical neurons, which allow both upstream signals and random electrical noise to affect the likelihood of reaching action potential threshold. Here, each electron is modeled as an electromagnetic point source, interacting in a probabilistic manner with each neuronal membrane. The electron is described as some set of probability amplitudes, distributed across five orthogonal axes: x, y, z, energy state, and time. The membrane potential of each neuron is defined by the probabilistic spatial position and atomic orbital of each local electron, after some time evolution. The mixed sum of all probabilistic component pure states is the physical quantity of information held by the neural network, given by a complex-valued wavefunction. If the probabilistic trajectory of each electron over time t affects the voltage state of multiple computational units, then the system state must be computed as a whole, with the state of each neuron being resolved as every component pure state is resolved. This computational process yields a defined system state at a defined location in time, which immediately becomes the past as a new probability density forms. If the membrane surface of each computational unit is also a charge-detecting polymer substrate that meets the criteria of a holographic recording surface, then this encoding process will generate a holographic projection of representative information content. The constructive and destructive interference of high-dimensional probability amplitudes yields a non-deterministic computational outcome for each neuron. That now-defined system state is paired with a multi-sensory percept, which is exclusively accessed by the encoding structure, with content limited by the range and sensitivity of the sensory apparatus. This model usefully offers a plausible explanation for both perceptual content and non-deterministic computational outcomes emerging from cortical neural network activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Random electrical noise drives non-deterministic computation in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                In cortical neurons, spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations affect the likelihood of firing an action potential. Yet despite retaining sensitivity to random electrical noise in gating signaling outcomes, these cells achieve highly accurate computations with extraordinary energy efficiency. A new approach models the inherently probabilistic nature of cortical neuron firing as a thermodynamic process of non-deterministic computation. Typically, the cortical neuron is modeled as a binary computational unit, in either an off-state or an on-state, but here, the cortical neuron is modeled as a two-state quantum system, with some probability of switching from an off-state to an on-state. This approach explicitly takes into account the contribution of random electrical noise in gating signaling outcomes, particularly during cortical up-states. In this model, the membrane potential is described as the mixed sum of all component microstates, or the quantity of von Neumann entropy encoded by the computational unit. This distribution of macrostates is given by a density matrix, which undergoes a unitary change of basis as each unit, System A, interacts with its surrounding environment, System B. Any linear correlations reduce the number of distinguishable pure states, leading to the selection of an optimal system state in the present context. This process of information compression is shown to be equivalent to the extraction of predictive value from a thermodynamic quantity of information. Calculations demonstrate that estimated coulomb scattering profiles and decoherence timescales in cortical neurons are consistent with a quantum system, with random electrical noise driving signaling outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The mechanics underpinning non-deterministic computation in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neurons allow random electrical noise to contribute to the likelihood of firing a signal. Previous approaches have involved statistically modeling signaling outcomes in neuronal populations, or modeling the dynamical relationship between membrane potential, ion channel activation, and ion conductance in individual neurons. However, these methods do not mechanistically account for the role of random electrical noise in gating the action potential. Here, the membrane potential of a cortical neuron is modeled as the uncertainty in all component pure states, or the amount of information encoded by that computational unit. With this approach, each neuron computes the probability of transitioning from an off-state to an on-state, with the macrostate of each computational unit being a function of all component microstates. Component pure states are integrated into a physical quantity of information, and the derivative of this high-dimensional probability density yields eigenvalues, or an internally-consistent observable system state at a defined point in time. In accordance with the Hellman-Feynman theorem, the resolution of the system state is paired with a spontaneous shift in charge distribution, and so this defined system state instantly becomes the past as a new probability density emerges. This model of Hamiltonian mechanics produces testable predictions regarding the wavelength of free energy released upon information compression. Overall, this model demonstrates how cortical neurons might achieve non-deterministic signaling outcomes through noisy coincidence detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocyte transcriptomic changes along the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play a critical role in brain homeostasis and normal functions but their changes along the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology remain largely unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on brain regions along the stereotypical progression of AD pathology from donors ranging the entire normal aging-AD continuum comprising 628,943 astrocyte nuclei from 32 donors across 5 brain regions. We discovered temporal gene-expression-trajectories with gene sets differentially activated at various disease stages. Surprisingly, a gene set enriched in proteostasis and energy metabolism, was upregulated in late-stage but unexpectedly returned to baseline levels in end-stage, suggesting exhaustion of response in "burnt-out" astrocytes. The spatial gene-expression-trajectories revealed that astrocytic genes of tripartite synapses are dysregulated in parallel to the stereotypical progression of tangle pathology across regions. We identified astrocyte heterogeneity across brain regions with a continuum from homeostatic to reactive cells through "intermediate" transitional states. These findings suggest complex astrocytic dysfunction in AD neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abstract deliberation by visuomotor neurons in prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                During visually guided behavior, the prefrontal cortex plays a pivotal role in mapping sensory inputs onto appropriate motor plans. When the sensory input is ambiguous, this involves deliberation. It is not known whether the deliberation is implemented as a competition between possible stimulus interpretations or between possible motor plans. Here we study neural population activity in prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys trained to flexibly report categorical judgments of ambiguous visual stimuli. Our task design allowed for the dissociation of neural predictors of the upcoming categorical choice and the upcoming motor response used to report this choice. We find that the population activity initially represents the formation of a categorical choice before transitioning into the stereotypical representation of the motor plan. We show that stimulus strength and prior expectations both bear on the formation of the categorical choice, but not on the formation of the action plan. These results suggest that prefrontal circuits involved in action selection are also used for the deliberation of abstract propositions divorced from a specific motor plan, thus providing a crucial mechanism for abstract reasoning.

	<p>Neural entrainment to musical rhythm is thought to underlie the perception and production of music. In aging populations, the strength of neural entrainment to rhythm has been found to be attenuated, particularly during attentive listening to auditory streams. However, previous studies on neural entrainment to rhythm and aging have often employed artificial auditory rhythms or limited pieces of recorded, naturalistic music, failing to account for the diversity of rhythmic structures found in natural music. As part of larger project assessing a novel music-based intervention for healthy aging, we investigated neural entrainment to musical rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to self-selected musical recordings across a sample of younger and older adults. We specifically measured neural entrainment to the level of musical pulse&amp;amp;mdash;quantified here as the phase-locking value (PLV)&amp;amp;mdash;after normalizing the PLVs to each musical recording&amp;amp;rsquo;s detected pulse frequency. As predicted, we observed strong neural phase-locking to musical pulse, and to the sub-harmonic and harmonic levels of musical meter. Overall, PLVs were not significantly different between older and younger adults. This preserved neural entrainment to musical pulse and rhythm could support the design of music-based interventions that aim to modulate endogenous brain activity via self-selected music for healthy cognitive aging.</p>

	<p>PICALM rs3851179, one of the genes most frequently linked to susceptibility of late-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (LOAD), plays a crucial role in regulating amyloid precursor protein, and amyloid &amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) transcytosis. To explore the effects of PICALM and AD continuum stage on cortex thickness, CSF A&amp;amp;beta;, and tau, 188 cognitively normal controls, 261 MCI patients, and 140 early LOAD patients were recruited, and each group was divided into rs3851179 A-carriers and GG-carriers. A full factorial ANCOVA was used to analyze the main effects and interactive effects of AD continuum stage, and PICALM. The interactive effects of AD continuum stage and PICALM on cortex thickness and CSF biomarkers were not significant. The main effect of PICALM was significant on the left postcentral cortex thickness, and the cortex thickness of A-carriers was less than that of GG-carriers. The rs3851179 A-carriers displayed higher A&amp;amp;beta;42 levels and A&amp;amp;beta;42/40 ratios, and lower P/T&amp;amp;ndash;tau ratios, compared with GG-carriers. A higher MMSE score was found in A-carriers among the LOAD patients. In conclusion, the main effects of PICALM were independent of AD continuum stage, and PICLAM rs3851179 genotypes may modulate left postcentral cortex thickness, A&amp;amp;beta;42 level, and P/T&amp;amp;ndash;tau ratio. The rs3851179 A-allele may protect the cognitive function of LOAD patients.</p>

	<p>Background: New trials are planned regularly to provide the highest quality of evidence and invade new occlusion territories, which requires a pre-defined reporting strategy with consistent, common data elements for more straightforward collective evidence synthesis. We sought to review all active endovascular thrombectomy trials to investigate their patient selection criteria, intervention description, and reported outcomes. Methods: A literature search was systematically conducted on clinicaltrials.gov for active trials and all intervention, inclusion criteria, and outcomes reported were extracted. A qualitative synthesis of the frequency of study design types and data elements are graphically and narratively presented. Results: A total of 32 studies were tagged and included in the final qualitative analysis. The inclusion criteria were highly variable, including different cut-offs for the last well-known baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, and modified Rankin scale (mRS). Half of the studies (16/32) mentioned &amp;amp;ldquo;thrombectomy&amp;amp;rdquo; without defining which technique or device was used, and the final thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale was provided in 19 (59.4%) studies. Heterogeneity was also present among the studies reporting a first-pass effect, both in how studies defined the outcome and in used ranges for mRS. Mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were more homogenous in their presentation and follow-up. Conclusions: There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the active thrombectomy trials concerning inclusion criteria, interventions used, and how outcomes are being reported.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the effects of music therapy on brain networks in MDD patients and to elucidate changes in functional brain connectivity in subjects before and after musical stimulation. EEG signals were collected from eight MDD patients and eight healthy controls. The phase locking value was adopted to calculate the EEG correlation of different channels in different frequency bands. Correlation matrices and network topologies were studied to analyze changes in functional connectivity between brain regions. The results of the experimental analysis found that the connectivity of the delta and beta bands decreased, while the connectivity of the alpha band increased. Regarding the characteristics of the EEG functional network, the average clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and degree of each node in the delta band decreased significantly after musical stimulation, while the characteristic path length in the beta band increased significantly. Characterized by the average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, the classification of depression and healthy controls reached 93.75% using a support vector machine.</p>

	<p>Motor and cognitive rehabilitation in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing field of clinical and research interest. In fact, novel rehabilitative approaches allow a very early verticalization and gait training through robotic devices and other innovative tools boosting neuroplasticity, thanks to the high-intensity, repetitive and task-oriented training. In the same way, cognitive rehabilitation is also evolving towards advanced interventions using virtual reality (VR), computer-based approaches, telerehabilitation and neuromodulation devices. This review aimed to systematically investigate the existing evidence concerning the role of innovative technologies in the motor and cognitive neurorehabilitation of TBI patients. We searched and reviewed the studies published in the Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed and Scopus between January 2012 and September 2022. After an accurate screening, only 29 papers were included in this review. This systematic review has demonstrated the beneficial role of innovative technologies when applied to cognitive rehabilitation in patients with TBI, while evidence of their effect on motor rehabilitation in this patient population is poor and still controversial.</p>

	<p>(1) Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of high altitude on inhibitory control processes that underlie sustained attention in the neural correlates of EEG data, and explore whether the EEG data reflecting inhibitory control contain valuable information to classify high-altitude chronic hypoxia and plain controls. (2) Methods: 35 chronic high-altitude hypoxic adults and 32 matched controls were recruited. They were required to perform the go/no-go sustained attention task (GSAT) using event-related potentials. Three machine learning algorithms, namely a support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and a decision tree (DT), were trained based on the related ERP components and neural oscillations to build a dichotomous classification model. (3) Results: Behaviorally, we found that the high altitude (HA) group had lower omission error rates during all observation periods than the low altitude (LA) group. Meanwhile, the ERP results showed that the HA participants had significantly shorter latency than the LAs for sustained potential (SP), indicating vigilance to response-related conflict. Meanwhile, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis suggested that lowlander immigrants exposed to high altitudes may have compensatory activated prefrontal cortexes (PFC), as reflected by slow alpha, beta, and theta frequency-band neural oscillations. Finally, the machine learning results showed that the SVM achieved the optimal classification F1 score in the later stage of sustained attention, with an F1 score of 0.93, accuracy of 92.54%, sensitivity of 91.43%, specificity of 93.75%, and area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97. The results proved that SVM classification algorithms could be applied to identify chronic high-altitude hypoxia. (4) Conclusions: Compared with other methods, the SVM leads to a good overall performance that increases with the time spent on task, illustrating that the ERPs and neural oscillations may provide neuroelectrophysiological markers for identifying chronic plateau hypoxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health status of women in reproductive age group and its determinants in rural Odisha, India using GHQ 12 questionnaire [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study was conceived with support from the Department of Health Research (DHR), India to use the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), to screen women in the reproductive age group, stratified for pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant and non-lactate women (NPNL), for their mental health status and examine it with their social background to understand the influences around their mental health.   Methods: By multistage sampling, subcenters were selected from 6 districts; women in the 3 groups were selected proportionately in each district, and data was collected on the basis of a pre-tested, pre-designed questionnaire along with the GHQ-12.   Results: Results showed GHQ-12 scores across the 3 categories of women are nearly the same with no significant difference (p=0.91). The higher GHQ (scores >11 to 36) were also noted to be equal for pregnant and lactating women i.e. 41.4% and mildly less for NPNL women 40.7%, reaffirming that pregnancy and the postnatal period add more stress to the woman’s life. Age of the women, age at marriage, hemoglobin levels, and poor Iron Folic Acid (IFA) intake were common predictors for poor mental health in all the 3 strata.  Conclusions: The study suggests that psychological stressors are cross-sectionally present in all three groups of women in the reproductive age group and all three strata need equal focus. Above 40% distress in mental health in women in all strata of the reproductive age group (ie pregnant women, post-natal women, and women not pregnant or lactating) is appalling, contrary to the general opinion that post-natal women alone face mental health compromise. Hence, the life cycle approach is recommended for best results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The odd log-logistic generalized exponential distribution: Application on survival times of chemotherapy patients data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The creation of developing new generalized classes of distributions has attracted applied and theoretical statisticians owing to their properties of flexibility. The development of generalized distribution aims to find distribution flexibility and suitability for available data. In this decade, most authors have developed classes of distributions that are new, to become valuable for applied researchers. Methods: This study aims to develop the odd log-logistic generalized exponential distribution (OLLGED), one of the lifetime newly generated distributions in the field of statistics. The advantage of the newly generated distribution is the heavily tailed distributed lifetime data set. Most of the probabilistic properties are derived including generating functions, moments, and quantile and order statistics. Results: Estimation of the model parameter is done by the maximum likelihood method. The performance of parametric estimation is studied through simulation. Application of OLLGED and its flexibilities is done using two data sets and while its performance is done on the randomly simulated data set. Conclusions: The application and flexibility of the OLLGED are ensured through empirical observation using two sets of lifetime data, establishing that the proposed OLLGED can provide a better fit in comparison to existing rival models, such as odd generalized log-logistic, type-II generalized log-logistic, exponential distributions, odd exponential log-logistic, generalized exponential, and log-logistic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Oral manifestations associated with Novel Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19): A questionnaire based hypothetical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019, the virus has evolved drastically, presenting with sets of mutations that influence its properties, including transmissibility and antigenicity. The oral mucosa is postulated as probable portal entry and several oral manifestations have been identified, which places dental professionals in a position to recognize probable COVID-19 patients depending on oral signs and symptoms in the initial phases of the disease itself. As co-existing with COVID-19 seems to be a new reality, greater understanding is required regarding early oral signs and symptoms which can be predictors for timely intervention and prevention of complications in COVID-19 patients. The objective of the study is to identify the distinguishing oral signs and symptoms among COVID-19 patients and to establish possible correlation between severity of COVID-19 infection and oral symptoms. Methods: This study recruited 179 ambulatory, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province's designated hotels for COVID-19 and home isolated patients from the same region using a convenience sample method. Data was collected by qualified and experienced investigators, including two physicians and three dentists, using a validated comprehensive questionnaire through telephonic interviews with the participants. The X2 was used to assess the categorical variables, and odd's ratio was calculated to determine the strength of the association between general symptoms and oral manifestations. Results: Oral and nasopharyngeal lesions or conditions like loss of smell and taste, xerostomia, sore throat, and burning sensation were predictors of COVID-19-related systemic symptoms such as cough, fatigue, fever, and nasal congestion were identified to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions: The study reveals the occurrence of olfactory or taste dysfunction, dry mouth, sore throat, and burning sensation along with COVID-19 generic symptoms, should be considered as suggestive yet not conclusive indicators of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A rapid review of the prevalence and onset of urticaria triggered by COVID-19 vaccine [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is essential to reduce the spread of this disease virus and is very effective at preventing patients with severe symptoms of the disease from dying. As of February 2022, more than 10 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide, and at least 60% of the world's population have received the first dose of the vaccine. The increasing number of populations receiving the COVID-19 vaccine has increased reports of post-immunization follow-up events, one of which is urticaria. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This study used a rapid review method based on previous research on the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the COVID-19 vaccine. The articles were obtained from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The inclusion criteria were articles containing data on the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the COVID-19 vaccine, published from December 2020 – January 2022. Results: From the search results and article selection, 20 articles were included in this study. There are 7 articles containing prevalence data, 11 articles containing onset data, and 2 articles containing prevalence and onset data. Research in these articles was conducted in several different countries. There were seven types of vaccine used with doses of 1 or 2. The sample age ranged from 16 to 76 years. In all of the articles, the sample and the incidence of urticaria were mostly female. There were a history of allergies and atopic history in the sample studied. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of urticaria in the population given the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 0.035% to 3.2%. The time of onset of urticaria in the population given the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 5 minutes to 10 days.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of Albania's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union during the years 1948-1959 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper aims to shed light on a very intense period of relations between Albania and the Soviet Union (USSR), focusing on the period from 1948 with the intensification of Albania's relations with the USSR until the termination of diplomatic relations in 1959. The main objective of this paper is to know the truth of the relations of the USSR and its behavior with Albania. Methods: The paper focuses on analyzing this period as a case study, selecting three levels (context-actors-outcomes). Evaluation of the period (1948-1959) is done through the identification of key indicators and the implications of the relationship in domestic and international contexts. The sources used include documents, interviews, films, newspapers, and books. We requested permission to use the Archival resources of the Albanian Central State Archives (AQSH), where they made some accessible non-state secret resources workable only within the archive available to us. Results: The facts show that the relations between Albania and the USSR benefitted Albania more. particularly with a lot of economic support from the USSR, which helped Albania emerge from crisis and build the so-called ‘socialist state’. Through these relations and contributions, Albania took its place in the international arena. We find that this may be because of the geographical position of Albania, as the construction of the Pashaliman naval base and the bay of Vlora indicates. Conclusions: This study tries to demystify this relationship that has had a lot of ambiguity cast over it. Documents of the AQSH do not provide an unbiased overview, as they were compiled with an ideologically charged spirit, making it difficult for researchers to reach conclusions without ideological input from both sides. We hope that we will have the opportunity to access restricted documents to provide a clearer picture of the relations between Albania and the USSR.
