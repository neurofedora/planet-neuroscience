<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Data mining was performed at the databases of the Allen Institute for Brain Science (<a target="_blank"

   title="Link to external resource: RRID:SCR_017001">RRID:SCR_017001</a>) searching for genes expressed selectively throughout the adult mouse mesocortex (transitional cortex ring predicted within the concentric ring theory of mammalian cortical structure, in contrast with central isocortex [ICx] and peripheral allocortex). We aimed to explore a shared molecular profile selective of all or most mesocortex areas. This approach checks and corroborates the precision of other previous definitory criteria, such as poor myelination and high kainate receptor level. Another aim was to examine which cortical areas properly belong to mesocortex. A total of 34 positive adult selective marker genes of mesocortex were identified, jointly with 12 negative selective markers, making a total of 46 markers. All of them identify the same set of cortical areas surrounding the molecularly different ICx as well as excluding adjacent allocortex. Four representative mesocortex markers—<i>Crym</i>, <i>Lypd1</i>, <i>Cdh13</i>, and <i>Smoc2</i>—are amply illustrated, jointly with complementary material including <i>myelin basic protein</i>, to check myelination, and <i>Rorb</i>, to check layer 4 presence. The retrosplenial (ReSp) area, long held to be mesocortical, does not share any of the 46 markers of mesocortex and instead expresses <i>Nr4a2</i> and <i>Tshz2</i>, selective parahippocampal allocortex markers. Moreover, it is not hypomyelinic and lacks a <i>Rorb</i>-positive layer 4, aspects generally present in mesocortex. Exclusion of the ReSp area from the mesocortex ring reveals the latter to be closed at this locus instead by two adjacent areas previously thought to be associative visual ICx (reidentified here molecularly as postsplenial and parasplenial mesocortex areas). The concepts of ICx, mesocortex, and parahippocampal allocortex are thus subtly modified by substantial molecular evidence.</p>

     alt="Atypical Course of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Tract in Chick Embryos"/>
<p>The retroflex tract is a prominent diencephalic landmark in vertebrates but seems absent in adult avian. Here, using BEN immunohistochemistry that specifically identifies fibers of this tract, we study their distribution from the habenular region to the interpeduncular complex. We found that many habenular fibers diverge in an atypical dispersed course through the thalamic cell mass and toward the prethalamic region (top figure). The diagram shows the atypical course of the fibers. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Classical studies of the avian diencephalon hardly mention the habenulo-interpeduncular tract (a.k.a. retroflex tract), although both the habenula (HB) (its origin) and the interpeduncular nuclear complex (its target) are present. Retroflex tract fibers were described at early embryonic stages but seem absent in the adult in routine stains. However, this tract is a salient diencephalic landmark in all other vertebrate lineages. It typically emerges out of the caudal HB, courses dorsoventrally across thalamic alar and basal plates just in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary, and then sharply bends 90° caudalwards at paramedian basal plate levels (this is the “retroflexion”), to approach longitudinally via paramedian pretectum and midbrain the rostralmost hindbrain, specifically the prepontine median interpeduncular complex across isthmus and rhombomere 1. We systematize this habenulo-interpeduncular course into four parts named subhabenular, retrothalamic, tegmental, and interpeduncular. We reexamined the chicken habenulo-interpeduncular fibers at stages HH30 and HH35 (6.5- and 9-day incubation) by mapping them specifically with immunoreaction for BEN protein, a well-known marker. We found that only a small fraction of the stained retroflex tract fibers approaches the basal plate by coursing along the standard dorsoventral pathway in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary. Many other habenular fibers instead diverge into atypical dispersed courses across the thalamic cell mass (implying alteration of the first subhabenular part of the standard course) before reaching the basal plate; this dispersion explains their invisibility. A significant number of such transthalamic habenular fibers cross orthogonally the zona limitans (ZLI) (the rostral thalamic boundary) and invade the caudal alar prethalamus. Here, they immediately descend dorsoventrally, just rostrally to the ZLI, until reaching the prethalamic basal plate, where they bend (retroflex) caudalwards, entering the thalamic basal paramedian area. These atypical fibers gradually fasciculate with the other groups of habenular efferent fibers in their final longitudinal approach to the hindbrain interpeduncular complex. We conclude that the poor visibility of this tract in birds is due to its dispersion into a diversity of atypical alternative routes, though all components eventually reach the interpeduncular complex. This case merits further analysis of the diverse permissive versus nonpermissive guidance mechanisms called into action, which partially correlate distinctly with successive diencephalic, mesencephalic, and hindbrain neuromeric fields and their boundaries.</p>

     alt="Excitatory Projections of Wide Field Collicular Neurons to the Nucleus of the Optic Tract in the Rat"/>
<p>We report a novel class of rat collicular neurons (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) with horizontally oriented and spiny-rich dendrites in the retinorecipient superficial layers of the superior colliculus. This subpopulation of excitatory wide field neurons invariably project to the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), and some of them express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The superficial layers of the mammalian superior colliculus (SC) contain neurons that are generally responsive to visual stimuli but can differ considerably in morphology and response properties. To elucidate the structure and function of these neurons, we combined extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling, detailed anatomical reconstruction, and ultrastructural analysis of the synaptic contacts of labeled neurons, using transmission electron microscopy. Our labeled neurons project to different brainstem nuclei. Of particular importance are neurons that fit the morphological criteria of the wide field (WF) neurons and whose dendrites are horizontally oriented. They display a rather characteristic axonal projection pattern to the nucleus of optic tract (NOT); thus, we call them superior collicular WF projecting to the NOT (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) neurons. We corroborated the morphological characterization of this neuronal type as a distinct neuronal class with the help of unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Our ultrastructural data demonstrate that SCWF<sub>NOT</sub> neurons establish excitatory connections with their targets in the NOT. Although, in rodents, the literature about the WF neurons has focused on their extensive projection to the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, as a conduit for information to reach the visual association areas of the cortex, our data suggest that this subclass of WF neurons may participate in the optokinetic nystagmus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-3/v2?src=rss">COVID-19 and the need for special care for women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective The study investigates the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess whether women with PCOS are at a higher susceptibility and risk for COVID-19 complications. Methods This review analyzes articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library, focusing on the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 1, 2019, until November 1, 2022. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the NIH quality assessment tool. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023371956) on January 12, 2023. Results A total of 11 observational studies were identified, totaling 22,155 PCOS patients. Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies, the findings of most of the studies were similar in terms of increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection in PCOS patients. PCOS patients were reported to have a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-PCOS women (HR =1.51). Many causes have been identified to play a role, most notably the overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and elevated levels of RAS-associated proteins, decreased serum levels of neuropilin-1 (sNRP1), elevated serum biomarkers such as platelet degranulation and coagulation cascade markers increased acute phase response, and lower levels of vitamin D could render PCOS patients susceptible to a chronic inflammatory state, which can also lead to difficulties and severe consequences, when impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic also influenced psychological well-being, with an increase in the incidence and severity of depression and anxiety among PCOS patients in the COVID-19 pandemic era compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions Patients with PCOS are more likely to get infected with COVID-19 and display a higher affinity to severe infections and complications due to overlapping and confounding factors. These findings suggest that PCOS patients may need more medical attention when infected with COVID-19.

                <p>Phospholipids (PLs) are asymmetrically distributed at the plasma membrane. This asymmetric lipid distribution is transiently altered during calcium-regulated exocytosis, but the impact of this transient remodeling on presynaptic function is currently unknown. As phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) randomizes PL distribution between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane in response to calcium activation, we set out to determine its role in neurotransmission. We report here that PLSCR1 is expressed in cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) and that PLSCR1-dependent phosphatidylserine egress occurred at synapses in response to neuron stimulation. Synaptic transmission is impaired at GrC <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> synapses, and both PS egress and synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis are inhibited in <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cultured neurons from male and female mice, demonstrating that PLSCR1 controls PL asymmetry remodeling and SV retrieval following neurotransmitter release. Altogether, our data reveal a novel key role for PLSCR1 in SV recycling and provide the first evidence that PL scrambling at the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for optimal presynaptic performance.</p>

                <p>Sex differences have complicated our understanding of the neurobiological basis of many behaviors that are key for survival. As such, continued elucidation of the similarities and differences between sexes is necessary to gain insight into brain function and vulnerability. The connection between the hippocampus (Hipp) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial site where modulation of neuronal activity mediates reward-related behavior. Our previous work demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) of Hipp-&gt;NAc synapses is rewarding, and mice can establish learned associations between LTP of these synapses and the contextual environment in which LTP occurred. Here, we investigated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying Hipp-&gt;NAc LTP using whole-cell electrophysiology and pharmacology. We observed similarities in basal synaptic strength between males and females and found that LTP occurs postsynaptically with similar magnitudes in both sexes. However, key sex differences emerged as LTP in males required NMDA receptors (NMDAR), whereas LTP in females utilized an NMDAR-independent mechanism involving L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and estrogen receptor &alpha; (ER&alpha;). We also uncovered sex-similar features as LTP in both sexes depended on CaMKII activity and occurred independently of dopamine-1 receptor (D1R) activation. Our results have elucidated sex-specific molecular mechanisms for LTP in an integral pathway that mediates reward-related behaviors, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a variable in mechanistic studies. Continued characterization of sex-specific mechanisms underlying plasticity will offer novel insight into the neurophysiological basis of behavior, with significant implications for understanding how diverse processes mediate behavior and contribute to vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e0326242024?rss=1">MEG Evidence That Modality-Independent Conceptual Representations Contain Semantic and Visual Features</a></h4>

              
                <p>The semantic knowledge stored in our brains can be accessed from different stimulus modalities. For example, a picture of a cat and the word "cat" both engage similar conceptual representations. While existing research has found evidence for modality-independent representations, their content remains unknown. Modality-independent representations could be semantic, or they might also contain perceptual features. We developed a novel approach combining word/picture cross-condition decoding with neural network classifiers that learned latent modality-independent representations from MEG data (25 human participants, 15 females, 10 males). We then compared these representations to models representing semantic, sensory, and orthographic features. Results show that modality-independent representations correlate both with semantic and visual representations. There was no evidence that these results were due to picture-specific visual features or orthographic features automatically activated by the stimuli presented in the experiment. These findings support the notion that modality-independent concepts contain both perceptual and semantic representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e0790232024?rss=1">Regulation of the Mouse Ventral Tegmental Area by Melanin-Concentrating Hormone</a></h4>

              
                <p>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) acts via its sole receptor MCHR1 in rodents and is an important regulator of homeostatic behaviors like feeding, sleep, and mood to impact overall energy balance. The loss of MCH signaling by MCH or MCHR1 deletion produces hyperactive mice with increased energy expenditure, and these effects are consistently associated with a hyperdopaminergic state. We recently showed that MCH suppresses dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which principally receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the mechanisms underlying MCH-regulated dopamine release are not clearly defined. MCHR1 expression is widespread and includes dopaminergic VTA cells. However, as the VTA is a neurochemically diverse structure, we assessed <I>Mchr1</I> gene expression at glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic VTA cells and determined if MCH inhibited the activity of VTA cells and/or their local microcircuit. <I>Mchr1</I> expression was robust in major VTA cell types, including most dopaminergic (78%) or glutamatergic cells (52%) and some GABAergic cells (38%). Interestingly, MCH directly inhibited dopaminergic and GABAergic cells but did not regulate the activity of glutamatergic cells. Rather, MCH produced a delayed increase in excitatory input to dopamine cells and a corresponding decrease in GABAergic input to glutamatergic VTA cells. Our findings suggested that MCH may acutely suppress dopamine release while disinhibiting local glutamatergic signaling to restore dopamine levels. This indicated that the VTA is a target of MCH action, which may provide bidirectional regulation of energy balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e1175232024?rss=1">Complexity Matters: Normalization to Prototypical Viewpoint Induces Memory Distortion along the Vertical Axis of Scenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scene memory is prone to systematic distortions potentially arising from experience with the external world. Boundary transformation, a well-known memory distortion effect along the near-far axis of the three-dimensional space, represents the observer's erroneous recall of scenes&rsquo; viewing distance. Researchers argued that normalization to the prototypical viewpoint with the high-probability viewing distance influenced this phenomenon. Herein, we hypothesized that the prototypical viewpoint also exists in the vertical angle of view (AOV) dimension and could cause memory distortion along scenes&rsquo; vertical axis. Human subjects of both sexes were recruited to test this hypothesis, and two behavioral experiments were conducted, revealing a systematic memory distortion in the vertical AOV in both the forced choice (<I>n</I> = 79) and free adjustment (<I>n</I> = 30) tasks. Furthermore, the regression analysis implied that the complexity information asymmetry in scenes&rsquo; vertical axis and the independent subjective AOV ratings from a large set of online participants (<I>n</I> = 1,208) could jointly predict AOV biases. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (<I>n</I> = 24), we demonstrated the involvement of areas in the ventral visual pathway (V3/V4, PPA, and OPA) in AOV bias judgment. Additionally, in a magnetoencephalography experiment (<I>n</I> = 20), we could significantly decode the subjects&rsquo; AOV bias judgments ~140&nbsp;ms after scene onset and the low-level visual complexity information around the similar temporal interval. These findings suggest that AOV bias is driven by the normalization process and associated with the neural activities in the early stage of scene processing.</p>

                <p>It was proposed that a reorganization of the relationships between cognitive functions occurs in dementia, a vision that surpasses the idea of a mere decline of specific domains. The complexity of cognitive structure, as assessed by neuropsychological tests, can be captured by exploratory graph analysis (EGA). EGA was applied to the neuropsychological assessment of people (humans) with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD; total <I>N</I> = 638). Both sexes were included. In AD, memory scores detach from the other cognitive functions, and memory subdomains reduce their reciprocal relation. SCD showed a pattern of segregated neuropsychological domains, and MCI showed a noisy and less stable pattern. Results suggest that AD drives a reorganization of cognitive functions toward a less-fractionated architecture compared with preclinical conditions. Cognitive functions show a reorganization that goes beyond the performance decline. Results also have clinical implications in test interpretations and usage.</p>

                <p>The canonical visual cycle employing RPE65 as the retinoid isomerase regenerates 11-<I>cis</I>-retinal to support both rod- and cone-mediated vision. Mutations of <I>RPE65</I> are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis that results in rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss of affected patients at an early age. Dark-reared <I>Rpe65<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mouse has been known to form isorhodopsin that employs 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal as the photosensitive chromophore. The mechanism regulating 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal synthesis and the role of the endogenous 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal in cone survival and function remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that ablation of fatty acid transport protein-4 (FATP4), a negative regulator of 11-<I>cis</I>-retinol synthesis catalyzed by RPE65, increased the formation of 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal, but not 11-<I>cis</I>-retinal, in a light-independent mechanism in both sexes of RPE65-null <I>rd</I>12 mice. Both <I>rd</I>12 and <I>rd</I>12;<I>Fatp4<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice contained a massive amount of all-<I>trans</I>-retinyl esters in the eyes, exhibiting comparable scotopic vision and rod degeneration. However, expression levels of M- and S-opsins as well as numbers of M- and S-cones surviving in the superior retinas of <I>rd</I>12;<I>Fatp4<sup>&ndash;/</sup></I><sup>&ndash;</sup> mice were at least twofold greater than those in age-matched <I>rd</I>12 mice. Moreover, FATP4 deficiency significantly shortened photopic <I>b</I>-wave implicit time, improved M-cone visual function, and substantially deaccelerated the progression of cone degeneration in <I>rd</I>12 mice, whereas FATP4 deficiency in mice with wild-type <I>Rpe65</I> alleles neither induced 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal formation nor influenced cone survival and function. These results identify FATP4 as a new regulator of synthesis of 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal, which is a "cone-tropic" chromophore supporting cone survival and function in the retinas with defective RPE65.</p>

                <p>The intricate relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and visual contrast detection variability has been the focus of numerous studies. However, the causal impact of prestimulus alpha traveling waves on visual contrast detection remains largely unexplored. In our research, we sought to discern the causal link between prestimulus alpha traveling waves and visual contrast detection across different levels of mental fatigue. Using electroencephalography alongside a visual detection task with 30 healthy adults (13 females; 17 males), we identified a robust negative correlation between prestimulus alpha forward traveling waves (FTWs) and visual contrast threshold (VCT). Inspired by this correlation, we utilized 45/&ndash;45&deg; phase-shifted transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in a sham-controlled, double-blind, within&ndash;subject experiment with 33 healthy adults (23 females; 10 males) to directly modulate these alpha traveling waves. After the application of 45&deg; phase-shifted tACS, we observed a substantial decrease in FTW and an increase in backward traveling waves, along with a concurrent increase in VCT, compared with the sham condition. These changes were particularly pronounced under a low fatigue state. The findings of state-dependent tACS effects reveal the potential causal role of prestimulus alpha traveling waves in visual contrast detection. Moreover, our study highlights the potential of 45/&ndash;45&deg; phase-shifted tACS in cognitive modulation and therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>Aberrant condensation and localization of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused in sarcoma (FUS) occur in variants of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Changes in RBP function are commonly associated with changes in axonal cytoskeletal organization and branching in neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we asked whether branching defects also occur in vivo in a model of FUS-associated disease. We use two reported <I>Xenopus</I> models of ALS/FTD (of either sex), the ALS-associated mutant FUS(P525L) and a mimic of hypomethylated FUS, FUS(16R). Both mutants strongly reduced axonal complexity in vivo. We also observed an axon looping defect for FUS(P525L) in the target area, which presumably arises due to errors in stop cue signaling. To assess whether the loss of axon complexity also had a cue-independent component, we assessed axonal cytoskeletal integrity in vitro. Using a novel combination of fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, we found that mutant FUS reduced actin density in the growth cone, altering its mechanical properties. Therefore, FUS mutants may induce defects during early axonal development.</p>

                <p>While ipsilesional cortical electroencephalography has been associated with poststroke recovery mechanisms and outcomes, the role of the cerebellum and its interaction with the ipsilesional cortex is still largely unknown. We have previously shown that poststroke motor control relies on increased corticocerebellar coherence (CCC) in the low beta band to maintain motor task accuracy and to compensate for decreased excitability of the ipsilesional cortex. We now extend our work to investigate corticocerebellar network changes associated with chronic stimulation of the dentato-thalamo-cortical pathway aimed at promoting poststroke motor rehabilitation. We investigated the excitability of the ipsilesional cortex, the dentate (DN), and their interaction as a function of treatment outcome measures. Relative to baseline, 10 human participants (two women) at the end of 4&ndash;8&nbsp;months of DN deep brain stimulation (DBS) showed (1) significantly improved motor control indexed by computerized motor tasks; (2) significant increase in ipsilesional premotor cortex event-related desynchronization that correlated with improvements in motor function; and (3) significant decrease in CCC, including causal interactions between the DN and ipsilesional cortex, which also correlated with motor function improvements. Furthermore, we show that the functional state of the DN in the poststroke state and its connectivity with the ipsilesional cortex were predictive of motor outcomes associated with DN-DBS. The findings suggest that as participants recovered, the ipsilesional cortex became more involved in motor control, with less demand on the cerebellum to support task planning and execution. Our data provide unique mechanistic insights into the functional state of corticocerebellar-cortical network after stroke and its modulation by DN-DBS.</p>

                <p>Neurons are highly polarized cells that are composed of a single axon and multiple dendrites. Axon&ndash;dendrite polarity is essential for proper tissue formation and brain functions. Intracellular protein transport plays an important role in the establishment of neuronal polarity. However, the regulatory mechanism of polarized transport remains unclear. Here, we show that Rab6, a small GTPase that acts on the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking, plays key roles in neuronal polarization and brain development. Central nervous system-specific Rab6a/b double knock-out (Rab6 DKO) mice of both sexes exhibit severe dysplasia of the neocortex and the cerebellum. In the Rab6 DKO neocortex, impaired axonal extension of neurons results in hypoplasia of the intermediate zone. In vitro, deletion of Rab6a and Rab6b in cultured neurons from both sexes causes the abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) adjacent to the Golgi apparatus, which leads to defects in axonal extension and the loss of axon&ndash;dendrite polarity. Moreover, Rab6 DKO causes significant expansion of lysosomes in the soma in neurons. Overall, our results reveal that Rab6-mediated polarized transport of SVPs is crucial for neuronal polarization and subsequent brain formation.</p>

                <p>We previously showed that orexin neurons are activated by hypoxia and facilitate the peripheral chemoreflex (PCR)-mediated hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), mostly by promoting the respiratory frequency response. Orexin neurons project to the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). The PVN contributes significantly to the PCR and contains nTS-projecting corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. We hypothesized that in male rats, orexin neurons contribute to the PCR by activating nTS-projecting CRH neurons. We used neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantify the degree that hypoxia activates PVN-projecting orexin neurons. We coupled this with orexin receptor (OxR) blockade with suvorexant (Suvo, 20&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) to assess the degree that orexin facilitates the hypoxia-induced activation of CRH neurons in the PVN, including those projecting to the nTS. In separate groups of rats, we measured the PCR following systemic orexin 1 receptor (Ox1R) blockade (SB-334867; 1&nbsp;mg/kg) and specific Ox1R knockdown in PVN. OxR blockade with Suvo reduced the number of nTS and PVN neurons activated by hypoxia, including those CRH neurons projecting to nTS. Hypoxia increased the number of activated PVN-projecting orexin neurons but had no effect on the number of activated nTS-projecting orexin neurons. Global Ox1R blockade and partial Ox1R knockdown in the PVN significantly reduced the PCR. Ox1R knockdown also reduced the number of activated PVN neurons and the number of activated tyrosine hydroxylase neurons in the nTS. Our findings suggest orexin facilitates the PCR via nTS-projecting CRH neurons expressing Ox1R.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0223-24.2024?rss=1">Value-Driven Adaptations of Mesolimbic Dopamine Release Are Governed by Both Model-Based and Model-Free Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>The magnitude of dopamine signals elicited by rewarding events and their predictors is updated when reward value changes. It is actively debated how readily these dopamine signals adapt and whether adaptation aligns with model-free or model-based reinforcement&ndash;learning principles. To investigate this, we trained male rats in a pavlovian-conditioning paradigm and measured dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core in response to food reward (unconditioned stimulus) and reward-predictive conditioned stimuli (CS), both before and after reward devaluation, induced via either sensory-specific or nonspecific satiety. We demonstrate that (1) such devaluation reduces CS-induced dopamine release rapidly, without additional pairing of CS with devalued reward and irrespective of whether the devaluation was sensory-specific or nonspecific. In contrast, (2) reward devaluation did not decrease food reward-induced dopamine release. Surprisingly, (3) postdevaluation reconditioning, by additional pairing of CS with devalued reward, rapidly reinstated CS-induced dopamine signals to predevaluation levels. Taken together, we identify distinct, divergent adaptations in dopamine-signal magnitude when reward value is decreased: CS dopamine diminishes but reinstates fast, whereas reward dopamine is resistant to change. This implies that, respective to abovementioned findings, (1) CS dopamine may be governed by a model-based mechanism and (2) reward dopamine by a model-free one, where (3) the latter may contribute to swift reinstatement of the former. However, changes in CS dopamine were not selective for sensory specificity of reward devaluation, which is inconsistent with model-based processes. Thus, mesolimbic dopamine signaling incorporates both model-free and model-based mechanisms and is not exclusively governed by either.</p>

                <p>Synapsins are highly abundant presynaptic proteins that play a crucial role in neurotransmission and plasticity via the clustering of synaptic vesicles. The synapsin III isoform is usually downregulated after development, but in hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, it persists in adulthood. Mossy fiber boutons express presynaptic forms of short- and long-term plasticity, which are thought to underlie different forms of learning. Previous research on synapsins at this synapse focused on synapsin isoforms I and II. Thus, a complete picture regarding the role of synapsins in mossy fiber plasticity is still missing. Here, we investigated presynaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber boutons by combining electrophysiological field recordings and transmission electron microscopy in a mouse model lacking all synapsin isoforms. We found decreased short-term plasticity, i.e., decreased facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation, but increased long-term potentiation in male synapsin triple knock-out (KO) mice. At the ultrastructural level, we observed more dispersed vesicles and a higher density of active zones in mossy fiber boutons from KO animals. Our results indicate that all synapsin isoforms are required for fine regulation of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber synapse.</p>

     alt="Emergence of the ZNF675 Gene During Primate Evolution–Influenced Human Neurodevelopment Through Changing HES1 Autoregulation"/>
<p>During primate evolution, structural changes in ZNF675 drove its ability to repress a primate-specific class of transposable elements (TEs) as part of the evolutionary arms race between ZNF genes and TEs. As an evolutionary by-stander effect, ZNF675 also became important for the expression of key neurodevelopmental genes, thereby changing the human neurodevelopmental gene regulatory program.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) in the 19p12 locus, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The two genes in this locus, <i>ZNF675</i> and <i>ZNF681</i>, arose via gene duplication in primates, and their presence in several pathological CNVs in the human population suggests that either or both of these genes are required for normal human brain development. ZNF675 and ZNF681 are members of the Krüppel-associated box zinc finger (KZNF) protein family, a class of transcriptional repressors important for epigenetic silencing of specific genomic regions. About 170 primate-specific KZNFs are present in the human genome. Although KZNFs are primarily associated with repressing retrotransposon-derived DNA, evidence is emerging that they can be co-opted for other gene regulatory processes. We show that genetic deletion of <i>ZNF675</i> causes developmental defects in cortical organoids, and our data suggest that part of the observed neurodevelopmental phenotype is mediated by a gene regulatory role of ZNF675 on the promoter of the neurodevelopmental gene Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1 (<i>HES1</i>). We also find evidence for the recently evolved regulation of genes involved in neurological disorders, microcephalin 1 and sestrin 3. We show that ZNF675 interferes with HES1 auto-inhibition, a process essential for the maintenance of neural progenitors. As a striking example of how some KZNFs have integrated into preexisting gene expression networks, these findings suggest the emergence of <i>ZNF675</i> has caused a change in the balance of <i>HES1</i> autoregulation. The association of <i>ZNF675</i> CNV with human developmental disorders and ZNF675-mediated regulation of neurodevelopmental genes suggests that it evolved into an important factor for human brain development.</p>

                Background The open field assay is used to study anxiety-related traits and anxiolytic drugs in rodents. This assay entails measuring locomotor activity and time spent in the center of a chamber that is maintained at ambient room temperature. However, the ambient temperature in most laboratories varies daily and seasonally and can differ between buildings. We sought to evaluate how varying ambient temperature and core body temperature (CBT) affected open field locomotor activity and center time of male wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and Transient Receptor Potential Subfamily M Member 8 (Trpm8) knock-out (Trpm8-/- ) mice. TRPM8 is an ion channel that detects cool temperatures and is activated by icilin. Methods Mice were placed in the open field at 4°C and 23°C for 1 hour. Distance traveled and time spent in the center were measured. Mice were injected with icilin, M8-B, diazepam, or saline, and changes in activity level were recorded. Results The cooling agent icilin increased CBT and profoundly reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to controls. Likewise, cooling the ambient temperature to 4°C reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to Trpm8-/- mice. Conversely, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) reduced CBT and increased distance traveled and center time of WT mice when tested at 4°C. The TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) had no effect on CBT or open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. The anxiolytic diazepam reduced CBT in WT and Trpm8-/- mice. When tested at 4°C, diazepam increased distance traveled and center time in WT mice but did not alter open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. Conclusions Environmental temperature and drugs that affect CBT can influence locomotor behavior and center time in the open field assay, highlighting temperature (ambient and core) as sources of environmental and physiologic variability in this commonly used behavioral assay.

                Background Climate change denial (CCD) has been found to be more pronounced among individuals with a conservative political orientation. Terror Management Theory posits that an individual’s worldview serves as a primary defense mechanism in coping with existential threats, such as the reality of climate change. Drawing on these premises, we conducted preliminary research investigating the impact of death priming on CCD from the Terror management theory perspective. Methods and results We administered a death priming task and measured CCD in its immediate wake or following a delay task. We confirmed among 219 Amazon’s MTurk participants that immediately following death priming, CCD was reduced among all participants. In the delayed death priming condition, we acquired preliminary evidence that CCD was heightened among Republican participants. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the relevance of death priming to CCD tendencies and potentially spawn future research regarding CCD as a particular form of coping with existential threats.

Neuromechanical studies investigate how the nervous system interacts with the musculoskeletal (MSK) system to generate volitional movements. Such studies have been supported by simulation models that provide insights into variables that cannot be measured experimentally and allow a large number of conditions to be tested before the experimental analysis. However, current simulation models of electromyography (EMG), a core physiological signal in neuromechanical analyses, remain either limited in accuracy and conditions or are computationally heavy to apply. Here, we provide a computational platform to enable future work to overcome these limitations by presenting NeuroMotion, an open-source simulator that can modularly test a variety of approaches to the full-spectrum synthesis of EMG signals during voluntary movements. We demonstrate NeuroMotion using three sample modules. The first module is an upper-limb MSK model with OpenSim API to estimate the muscle fibre lengths and muscle activations during movements. The second module is BioMime, a deep neural network-based EMG generator that receives nonstationary physiological parameter inputs, like the afore-estimated muscle fibre lengths, and efficiently outputs motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). The third module is a motor unit pool model that transforms the muscle activations into discharge timings of motor units. The discharge timings are convolved with the output of BioMime to simulate EMG signals during the movement. We first show how MUAP waveforms change during different levels of physiological parameter variations and different movements. We then show that the synthetic EMG signals during two-degree-of-freedom hand and wrist movements can be used to augment experimental data for regressing joint angles. Ridge regressors trained on the synthetic dataset were directly used to predict joint angles from experimental data. In this way, NeuroMotion was able to generate full-spectrum EMG for the first use-case of human forearm electrophysiology during voluntary hand, wrist, and forearm movements. All intermediate variables are available, which allows the user to study cause-effect relationships in the complex neuromechanical system, fast iterate algorithms before collecting experimental data, and validate algorithms that estimate non-measurable parameters in experiments. We expect this modular platform will enable validation of generative EMG models, complement experimental approaches and empower neuromechanical research.

                <p>by Bin Liu, Bodo Rosenhahn, Thomas Illig, David S. DeLuca</p>

Interpreting transcriptome data is an important yet challenging aspect of bioinformatic analysis. While gene set enrichment analysis is a standard tool for interpreting regulatory changes, we utilize deep learning techniques, specifically autoencoder architectures, to learn latent variables that drive transcriptome signals. We investigate whether simple, variational autoencoder (VAE), and beta-weighted VAE are capable of learning reduced representations of transcriptomes that retain critical biological information. We propose a novel VAE that utilizes priors from biological data to direct the network to learn a representation of the transcriptome that is based on understandable biological concepts. After benchmarking five different autoencoder architectures, we found that each succeeded in reducing the transcriptomes to 50 latent dimensions, which captured enough variation for accurate reconstruction. The simple, fully connected autoencoder, performs best across the benchmarks, but lacks the characteristic of having directly interpretable latent dimensions. The beta-weighted, prior-informed VAE implementation is able to solve the benchmarking tasks, and provide semantically accurate latent features equating to biological pathways. This study opens a new direction for differential pathway analysis in transcriptomics with increased transparency and interpretability.

                <p>by Anushka Oza, Adarsh Kumar, Apoorva Sharma, Pratik K. Mutha</p>

The unpredictable nature of our world can introduce a variety of errors in our actions, including sensory prediction errors (SPEs) and task performance errors (TPEs). SPEs arise when our existing internal models of limb-environment properties and interactions become miscalibrated due to changes in the environment, while TPEs occur when environmental perturbations hinder achievement of task goals. The precise mechanisms employed by the sensorimotor system to learn from such limb- and task-related errors and improve future performance are not comprehensively understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed a series of learning experiments wherein the location and size of a reach target were varied, the visual feedback of the motion was perturbed in different ways, and instructions were carefully manipulated. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms employed to compensate SPEs and TPEs are dissociable. Specifically, our results fail to support theories that suggest that TPEs trigger implicit refinement of reach plans or that their occurrence automatically modulates SPE-mediated learning. Rather, TPEs drive improved action selection, that is, the selection of verbally sensitive, volitional strategies that reduce future errors. Moreover, we find that exposure to SPEs is necessary and sufficient to trigger implicit recalibration. When SPE-mediated implicit learning and TPE-driven improved action selection combine, performance gains are larger. However, when actions are always successful and strategies are not employed, refinement in behavior is smaller. Flexibly weighting strategic action selection and implicit recalibration could thus be a way of controlling how much, and how quickly, we learn from errors.

Sterile alpha motif domain-containing proteins 9 and 9-like (SAMD9/9L) are associated with life-threatening genetic diseases in humans and are restriction factors of poxviruses. Yet, their cellular function and the extent of their antiviral role are poorly known. Here, we found that interferon-stimulated human SAMD9L restricts HIV-1 in the late phases of replication, at the posttranscriptional and prematuration steps, impacting viral translation and, possibly, endosomal trafficking. Surprisingly, the paralog SAMD9 exerted an opposite effect, enhancing HIV-1. More broadly, we showed that SAMD9L restricts primate lentiviruses, but not a gammaretrovirus (MLV), nor 2 RNA viruses (arenavirus MOPV and rhabdovirus VSV). Using structural modeling and mutagenesis of SAMD9L, we identified a conserved Schlafen-like active site necessary for HIV-1 restriction by human and a rodent SAMD9L. By testing a gain-of-function constitutively active variant from patients with SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease, we determined that SAMD9L pathogenic functions also depend on the Schlafen-like active site. Finally, we found that the constitutively active SAMD9L strongly inhibited HIV, MLV, and, to a lesser extent, MOPV. This suggests that the virus-specific effect of SAMD9L may involve its differential activation/sensing and the virus ability to evade from SAMD9L restriction. Overall, our study identifies SAMD9L as an HIV-1 antiviral factor from the cell autonomous immunity and deciphers host determinants underlying the translational repression. This provides novel links and therapeutic avenues against viral infections and genetic diseases.

                Background: The aim of the current study was to assess the patients with COVID-19 and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the course of COVID-19. Methods: This prospective cohort study included patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 between December 2020 and December 2021. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were analysed. Results: 301 participants were enrolled in the study. 46 (15,3%) had moderate, and 162 (53,8%) had severe COVID-19. 14 (4,7%) patients died, and 30 (10,0%) were admitted to the ICU due to disease worsening. The majority needed oxygen therapy (n=224; 74,4%). Average vitamin 25(OH)D3 levels were below optimal at the admittance, and vitamin D deficiency was detected in 205 individuals. More male patients were suffering from vitamin D deficiency. Patients with the more severe disease showed lower levels of vitamin 25(OH)D3 in their blood. The most severe group of patients had more symptoms that lasted significantly longer with progressing disease severity. This group of patients also suffered from more deaths, ICU admissions, and treatments with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and oxygen. Conclusion: Patients with the severe course of COVID-19 were shown to have increased inflammatory parameters, increased mortality, and higher incidence of vitamin D deficiency. The results suggest that the vitamin D deficiency might represent a significant risk factor for a severe course of COVID-19.

                Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a pathogenic bacterium that affects shrimp aquaculture; its infection can lead to severe production losses of up to 90%. On the other hand, plant phenolic compounds have emerged as a promising alternative to combat bacterial infections. The antibacterial and anti-virulence activity of the plant phenolic compounds quercetin, morin, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid against two strains of V. parahaemolyticus (Vp124 and Vp320) was evaluated. Methods: The broth microdilution test was carried out to determine phenolic compounds' antibacterial activity. Moreover, the biofilm-forming ability of V. parahaemolyticus strains in the presence of phenolic compounds was determined by total biomass staining assay using the cationic dye crystal violet. The semisolid agar displacement technique was used to observe the effect of phenolic compounds on the swimming-like motility of V. parahaemolyticus. Results: Results showed that phenolic compounds inhibited both strains effectively, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.8 to 35.03 mM. Furthermore, at 0.125 – 0.5 × MIC of phenolic compounds, V. parahaemolyticus biofilms biomass was reduced by 63.22 – 92.68%. Also, quercetin and morin inhibited the motility of both strains by 15.86 – 23.64% (Vp124) and 24.28 – 40.71% (Vp320). Conclusions: The results suggest that quercetin, morin, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids may be potential agents for controlling V. parahaemolyticus.

                Understanding the nature of life and its propensity for reproduction has long been a question that humans aspire to answer. Reproduction, a defining characteristic of life, fundamentally involves the replication of genetic material, be it DNA or RNA. The driving force behind this replication process has always intrigued scientists. In recent years, theories involving selfish genes, the RNA world, and entropic forces have been proposed by some scholars. These theories seem to suggest that life, as we know it, exists solely in Earth’s environment and is based on a single type of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. However, if we broaden our definition of life to include any replicable molecules, we might be able to transcend traditional thought. This could potentially enhance our understanding of the impetus behind DNA replication and provide deeper insights into the essence of life.

                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR). METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

                Background Thoracic trauma is defined as a trauma that hits the chest wall directly or indirectly, either as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma. Thoracic trauma can occur in any age or genders, and become a life-threatening if the treatment isn’t immediate and appropriate. Methods This research was an observational study with a cohort retrospective design using secondary data in the form of thoracic trauma patients at The Zainoel Abidin General Hospital, Banda Aceh, Indonesia in the period January 2019-December 2020. The statistical analysis used were chi square for bivariate and multivariate analysis, spesifically logistic regression analysis was conducted to know which risk factor influences the most. Result There were 141 medical records used in this study, thoracic trauma was more common in men compared to women. The age group of 46-55 is the age group with the highest percentage of thoracic trauma patients, road traffic are the leading cause of thoracic trauma where the most common diagnosis is rib fractures. Significant factors that associated with the short outcome of thoracic trauma are thoracic trauma diagnosis (p=0,00), management of thoracic trauma (p=0,00), ventilator (p=0,04), duration of ventilator (p=0.01), sepsis (p=0,00), qSOFA score (p=0,00) and injury severity score (p=0,00). Conclusions Vehicle accidents contributed to a considerable number of traumatic chest injuries in this study. Diagnosis, management of trauma, days of ventilation, qSOFA score, injury severity score, and development of sepsis were associated with the short-term outcome among thoracic trauma patients. Injury severity score seems to be the most influential variable in this study, the lower the better it is. Road safety intervention is urgently needed to control the underlying problems in this study.

                Background As Thailand’s population ages, promoting senior citizens’ quality of life (QoL) is crucial. In 2017, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security launched the “elderly school” initiative to foster lifelong learning and enhance the QoL among senior citizens. However, comprehensive evaluations of its impact on QoL remain limited. Methods This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the policy’s effect on QoL in Phetchabun province, Thailand. Using quota and systematic sampling, 1,374 senior citizens aged 60-80 participated. Propensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 match was employed to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of attending the elderly school on QoL. Additionally, multiple linear regression was analyzed to assess the association between QoL and its associated factors. Results PSM were matched successfully, the standardized difference was less than 10 percent, and the baseline after matching indicated balances with 687 elderly people in each group. The mean QoL score of the non-attending group was 44.40 (SD = 7.11), and that of the attending group was 57.50 (SD = 7.53). The ATE for elderly people attending school was 10.67 scores (95% CI: 9.67 – 11.67 scores) higher than those unattended. Being female, having monthly income higher than 20,000, having employment, having a caregiver, and attendance at elderly school were positively associated with QoL, and the standardized beta coefficients were 0.078, 0.059, 0.094, 0.066, and 0.550, respectively. Additionally, higher education was positively associated with higher QoL. Conclusion The elderly school policy significantly enhanced the QoL of the attending senior citizens. Findings suggest continued collaboration among stakeholders to sustain and optimize this policy for improved seniors’ QoL, which has the potential to utilize lifelong learning to create an inclusive framework for healthy aging among senior citizens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-537/v2?src=rss">The legal and institutional framework for the protection of religious rights in Nigeria and the right to wear Hijab in public institutions. [version 2; peer review: 4 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Religion and its exercise are among the most sensitive discourses in different parts of the world, especially in Nigeria. The constitution and other laws ensure citizens are afforded basic human rights of which religious rights are included and yet regulated. There are questions of interpretation as to the extent to which such rights can be enjoyed and the efficacy of both the legal and institutional frameworks protecting religious rights in Nigeria. Methods This article utilises a doctrinal legal research approach utilising existing literature, statutes, and laws enacted towards the protection of religious rights in Nigeria with the consideration of primary and secondary sources of statutes including the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), judicial precedents, International Conventions, law textbooks, and peer-reviewed journals. A comparative analysis of Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey and Kazakhstan was done to gain perspectives on balancing conflicting interests in light of Nigeria’s heterogeneous status. As part of the contribution to knowledge, a hybrid model for mitigating the socio-legal effect of the usage of hijab in Nigeria’s public institutions is presented to further enrich Nigeria’s jurisprudence. A hybrid model is an approach that combines different sources or methodologies by integrating two or more distinct frameworks to leverage their strengths and effectively address specific needs or challenges. It is utilized to achieve synergy and maximize outcomes by blending diverse legal approaches in law. Results Nigeria, being a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state, demonstrates that the government must protect the public interests as it relates to religious rights regardless of faith or religion. The study reveals that the current legal approach without further legislative intervention on religious issues will be inadequate to address the problem. Therefore, this study presents a hybrid model for mitigating the socio-legal effect of the usage of hijab in Nigeria’s public institutions to avoid harm and further enrich Nigeria’s jurisprudence. Conclusions This study concludes by emphasizing the inadequacy of Nigeria’s legal and institutional frameworks regarding the protection of religious rights and the right to wear hijab in public institutions. Consequently, reform is deemed necessary.

                Preterm infants can face lasting neurodevelopmental challenges due to hypoxia-induced injury of the cerebral white matter. In this issue of Neuron, Ren et al. identify microvascular pericytes as unexpected targets for growth hormone signaling, which enhances angiogenesis and remyelination after hypoxic injury in the developing mouse brain.

                The locus coeruleus is the seat of a brain-wide neuromodulatory circuit. Using optogenetic and electrophysiological tools to selectively interrogate noradrenergic neurons in non-human primates, Ghosh and Maunsell show how locus coeruleus neurons contribute to a specific aspect of visual attention.

                Using TRAP to perform a brain-wide screen for embryonically active neurons, Wang et al. identify and demonstrate the transient developmental role of activity in a hub-like neuronal population in promoting recurrent connectivity in the piriform cortex. These findings suggest a mechanism of activity-dependent maturation of intracortical circuits.

                Metabolic and transcriptional cellular heterogeneity drives melanoma drug resistance and progression. This study reveals that ALDH1A3-ACSS2 directly coordinates nuclear acetaldehyde-acetyl-CoA metabolism with histone H3 acetylation and is associated with TFAP2B-neural crest stem cell and glucose metabolism gene expression. The ALDH1A3 metabolism-stem cell axis represents a potential therapeutic vulnerability in melanoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95648">Bacterial exonuclease III expands its enzymatic activities on single-stranded DNA</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial exonuclease III (ExoIII), widely acknowledged for specifically targeting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), has been documented as a DNA repair-associated nuclease with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)-endonuclease and 3′→5′ exonuclease activities. Due to these enzymatic properties, ExoIII has been broadly applied in molecular biosensors. Here, we demonstrate that ExoIII (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) possesses highly active enzymatic activities on ssDNA. By using a range of ssDNA fluorescence-quenching reporters and fluorophore-labeled probes coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, we found ExoIII cleaved the ssDNA at 5′-bond of phosphodiester from 3′ to 5′ end by both exonuclease and endonuclease activities. Additional point mutation analysis identified the critical residues for the ssDNase action of ExoIII and suggested the activity shared the same active center with the dsDNA-targeted activities of ExoIII. Notably, ExoIII could also digest the dsDNA structures containing 3′-end ssDNA. Considering most ExoIII-assisted molecular biosensors require the involvement of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or nucleic acid aptamer containing ssDNA, the activity will lead to low efficiency or false positive outcome. Our study revealed the multi-enzymatic activity and the underlying molecular mechanism of ExoIII on ssDNA, illuminating novel insights for understanding its biological roles in DNA repair and the rational design of ExoIII-ssDNA involved diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90944">Neurofeedback training can modulate task-relevant memory replay rate in rats</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal replay – the time-compressed, sequential reactivation of ensembles of neurons related to past experience – is a key neural mechanism of memory consolidation. Replay typically coincides with a characteristic pattern of local field potential activity, the sharp-wave ripple (SWR). Reduced SWR rates are associated with cognitive impairment in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that a clinically viable intervention to promote SWRs and replay would prove beneficial. We therefore developed a neurofeedback paradigm for rat subjects in which SWR detection triggered rapid positive feedback in the context of a memory-dependent task. This training protocol increased the prevalence of task-relevant replay during the targeted neurofeedback period by changing the temporal dynamics of SWR occurrence. This increase was also associated with neural and behavioral forms of compensation after the targeted period. These findings reveal short-timescale regulation of SWR generation and demonstrate that neurofeedback is an effective strategy for modulating hippocampal replay.

                Songbirds’ vocal mastery is impressive, but to what extent is it a result of practice? Can they, based on experienced mismatch with a known target, plan the necessary changes to recover the target in a practice-free manner without intermittently singing? In adult zebra finches, we drive the pitch of a song syllable away from its stable (baseline) variant acquired from a tutor, then we withdraw reinforcement and subsequently deprive them of singing experience by muting or deafening. In this deprived state, birds do not recover their baseline song. However, they revert their songs toward the target by about 1 standard deviation of their recent practice, provided the sensory feedback during the latter signaled a pitch mismatch with the target. Thus, targeted vocal plasticity does not require immediate sensory experience, showing that zebra finches are capable of goal-directed vocal planning.

">Regulation of proteostasis by sleep through autophagy in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunctions are common clinical features of Alzheimer 's Disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that in addition to being a symptom, sleep disturbances can also drive the progression of neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of AD, however the molecular pathways behind how sleep affects protein homeostasis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that sleep modulation influences proteostasis and the progression of neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of Tauopathy. We show that sleep deprivation enhanced Tau aggregational toxicity resulting in exacerbated synaptic degeneration. In contrast, sleep induction using gaboxadol led to reduced hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation in neurons as a result of modulated autophagic flux and enhanced clearance of ubiquitinated Tau, suggesting altered protein processing and clearance that resulted in improved synaptic integrity and function. These findings highlight the complex relationship between sleep and autophagy, in regulating protein homeostasis, and the neuroprotective potential of sleep-enhancing therapeutics to slow the progression or delay the onset of neurodegeneration.

">Vasopressin-to-Oxytocin Receptor Crosstalk in the Preoptic Area Underlying Parental Behaviors in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                The transition to parenthood brings significant changes in behavior toward offspring. For instance, in anticipation of their offspring, male mice shift from infanticidal to caregiving behaviors. While the release of oxytocin from the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) plays a critical role in paternal caregiving, it does not fully account for the entire behavioral shift. The specific downstream neurons and signaling mechanisms involved in this process remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that PVH vasopressin neurons also essentially contribute to a paternal behavioral shift. This vasopressin signal is partially transmitted through oxytocin receptors (OTRs) expressed in the anterior commissure and medial nuclei of the preoptic area. These OTR-expressing neurons receive inputs from both PVH oxytocin and vasopressin neurons and are responsible for expressing paternal caregiving behaviors. Collectively, this non-canonical vasopressin-to-OTR crosstalk within specific limbic circuits acts as a pivotal regulator of paternal behavioral changes in mice.

">Thalamic Control Over Laminar Cortical Dynamics Across Conscious States</a></h4>

              
                The human brain must support both stable and flexible neural dynamics in order to adapt to changing contexts. This paper investigates the role of the thalamus, a crucial subcortical structure, in orchestrating these opposing dynamics in the cerebral cortex. Through two distinct classes of cortical projections, the thalamus is able to support distinct dynamics modes: some cells relay precise information between cortical regions, whereas others diffusely modulate ongoing cortical dynamics. Traditional approaches to analysing neural data struggle to capture the moment-to-moment intricacies of brain dynamics, akin to mapping a rivers topography without understanding its flow, or laminarity. Inspired by the field of fluid dynamics, we show that spontaneous fMRI data exhibits non-trivial fluctuations in laminarity. Propofol-induced anesthesia selectively disrupts the non-laminar aspects of cortical dynamics while preserving laminar flow, which we validate with a large-scale biophysical model of the thalamocortical system. Finally, we confirmed theoretical predictions from the biophysical model using multielectrode electrophysiological recordings from the cerebral cortex of an anesthetized macaque - direct stimulation of the diffusely-projecting thalamus restored non-laminar cortical fluctuations and the waking state. We conclude that the thalamus provides versatile control over the cortical laminar and non-laminar flows that characterize conscious states.

">Medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus reuniens are critical for working memory in an operant delayed nonmatch task</a></h4>

              
                Working memory refers to the temporary retention of a small amount of information used in the execution of a cognitive task. The prefrontal cortex and its connections with thalamic subregions are thought to mediate specific aspects of working memory, including engaging with the hippocampus to mediate memory retrieval. We used an operant delayed-non match to position task, which does not require the hippocampus, to determine roles of the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the nucleus reuniens thalamic region (RE), and their connection. We found that transient inactivation of the mPFC and RE using the GABA-A agonist muscimol led to a delay-independent reduction in behavioral performance in the delayed non-match to position paradigm. Critically, we used a chemogenetic approach to determine the directionality of the necessary circuitry for behavioral performance reliant on working memory. Specifically, when we targeted mPFC neurons that project to the RE (mPFC-RE) we found a delay-independent reduction in the delayed non-match to position task, but not when we targeted RE neurons that project to the mPFC (RE-mPFC). Our results suggest a broader role for the mPFC-RE circuit in mediating working memory beyond the connection with the hippocampus.

">Modelling determinants of region-specific dopamine dynamics in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Striatal dopamine (DA) release regulates reward-related learning, motivation, and behavioural activation, and is believed to consist of a short-lived phasic and continuous tonic component. Here, we build a large-scale three-dimensional model of extracellular DA dynamics in the dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) based on experimentally determined biological parameters. The model predicts rapid dynamics in DS with little-to-no basal DA, whereas lower uptake capacity in VS slows signalling and enables build-up of a tonic DA level. Receptor binding simulations reveals that DA D1 receptor occupancy follows extracellular DA concentration with millisecond delay, while DA D2 receptors integrate DA signal over seconds. Our modelling further predicts that VS extracellular levels are highly sensitive to DA transporter (DAT) uptake capacity and posit prevalent nanoclustering of DAT in VS as a regulator of DA uptake. Our simulations substantiate regional differences in extracellular DA dynamics and challenge prevailing paradigms of striatal DA signalling.

">Flexible EMG arrays with integrated electronics for scalable electrode density</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in electrode technology have demonstrated the power of flexible microelectrode arrays (FMEAs) for measuring muscle activity at high resolution. We recently introduced the Myomatrix array, a FMEA optimized for measuring the activity of individual motor units (the collection of muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron) in freely behaving animals. Although FMEAs are fundamentally changing the way EMG is acquired, the number of recording channels is limited by the size of the plug that interfaces with the digital amplifier hardware and the density of electrode connections on the array. Increasing EMG channel count and supporting electrophysiological studies in smaller animals depends on two seemingly incompatible goals: reducing device size while increasing the number of recording channels. The solution to this is to increase channel density, which is currently limited by requiring that separate headstage and FMEA components be used simultaneously. In our prior devices, each FMEA had a dedicated wire output for every electrode input, creating a channel density is 1 : 1. To improve this channel density, we have developed a novel device integrating a digital amplifier (bare-die RHD2216 chip, Intan, Inc.) directly onto an FMEA. This new design reduces the device's backend footprint by 74% and relocates the intan bare die from the headstage to the FMEA itself, creating a channel density of 1 : 3.2. Our methodology combines standard FMEA microfabrication with wire-bonding and surface-mounted components, enabling direct integration into a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) connection into the device itself, without any separate headstage. With this initial device we see a 1 : 3.2 channel density, but our method allows for using other bare die amplifiers (Intan, Inc., USA) for a channel density of 1 : 12.8. Our findings present a robust technique for chip embedding in custom FMEAs, applicable to in-vivo electrophysiology.

">Single-cell transcriptomic changes in oligodendrocytes and precursors derived from Parkinson's disease patient-iPSCs with LRRK2-G2019S mutation</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive research, the contribution of the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation to Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Recent findings indicate oligodendrocytes (ODCs) and their progenitors are vulnerable in PD pathogenesis. Notably, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) exhibit high endogenous expression of LRRK2. We induced PD patient-iPSCs with the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation into oligodendroglial lineages and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Cell type composition analysis revealed an increase in OPCs, proliferating OPCs and ciliated ependymal cells in LRRK2 lines, all of which are characterized by LRRK2 expression. Differential expression analysis revealed transcriptomic changes in several pathways, including down-regulation of genes related to myelin assembly in ODCs, semaphorin-plexin pathway in OPCs, and cilium movement in proliferating OPCs. Cell-cell communication analysis identified significant alterations in several signaling pathways including a deactivation of PSAP signaling and an activation of MIF signaling in LRRK2 lines. Additionally, we observed an overall increase in SEMA6 signaling communication in LRRK2 cell lines; however, OPCs derived from these LRRK2 lines specifically lost SEMA6 signaling due to a down-regulation of SEMA6A and PLXNA2. Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis revealed that SHH had significantly altered expression along the pseudotime, accompanied by higher expression levels in LRRK2 lines. These findings highlight the need for a deep exploration of the complex interactions among semaphorin-plexin, sonic hedgehog and cilium pathways in PD. We envision that our work will serve as a valuable resource for uncovering potential targets in PD.

">Preparatory attentional templates in prefrontal and sensory cortex encode target-associated information</a></h4>

              
                Visual search relies on the ability to use information about the target in working memory to guide attention and make target-match decisions. This memory representation is referred to as the "attentional" or "target" template and is typically thought to contain veridical target information. However, more recent studies have shown that in complex visual environments, target-associated information is often used to guide attention (Battistoni et al., 2017; de Lange et al., 2018; Peelen et al., 2024; Vo et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2023). This is particularly true when the target is difficult to discriminate (Zhou & Geng, 2024). Here, we use fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, to test if attentional guidance by target-associated information is explicitly represented in the preparatory period before search begins, either in conjunction with the target or even in place of it. Participants were first trained on four face-scene category pairings. After learning, they engaged in a cued visual search task that began with a face cue, followed by a delay, and then a search display with two lateralized faces, each superimposed on a scene image. The target face appeared on its previously associated scene on 75% of "scene-valid" trials. Our results show that in the cue period, face information was decoded in the fusiform face area (FFA), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC). However, during the delay period, face information was no longer decoded from FFA; instead, scene information was now decoded in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and inferior frontal junction (IFJ). These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of template information during visual search and suggest that target-associated information can be used as a guiding template, even replacing actual target information in the active attentional template.

">Neural correlates of nightmares revisited: findings from large-scale fMRI cohorts</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives: Nightmares are linked to daytime distress and psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, knowledge about the brain regions involved in nightmare production is sparse. This study aimed to examine the relationship between nightmare frequency and the functional connectivity of the amygdala with the prefrontal cortex, which is central to emotional regulation. Additionally, the study sought to replicate previous findings on the neural correlates of nightmares using two large cohorts. Methods: 464 participants underwent functional and structural MRI recordings and answered questions assessing nightmare and dream recall frequency. A general linear model assessed the voxelwise correlation between the amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity with nightmare frequency. Additionally, regional homogeneity (ReHo) maps were calculated, high and low nightmare frequency and the entire nightmare frequency spectrum contrasts were determined while controlling for age, sex, and dream recall frequency. Results: The study did not find a significant correlation between nightmare frequency and amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity. Previous ReHo findings of group differences between high and low nightmare frequency could not be replicated. However, parametric analysis revealed an association between nightmare frequency and ReHo differences in the cerebellum. Conclusions: This failure to confirm hypothesized and previously reported results, especially with a larger sample size, suggests a need to reevaluate the existing knowledge of the neural correlates of nightmares and consider individual differences such as personality, trauma history, and cognitive processes. Overall, our findings highlight the complexities of interpreting neuroimaging data in sleep research.

">Cognitive neuropsychological and neuroanatomic predictors of naturalistic action performance in left hemisphere stroke: a retrospective analysis</a></h4>

              
                Individuals who have experienced a left hemisphere cerebrovascular accident (LCVA) have been shown to make errors in naturalistic action tasks designed to assess the ability to perform everyday activities such as preparing a cup of coffee. Naturalistic action errors in this population are often attributed to limb apraxia, a common deficit in the representation and performance of object-related actions. However, naturalistic action impairments are also observed in right hemisphere stroke and traumatic brain injury, populations infrequently associated with apraxia, and errors across all these populations are influenced by overall severity. Based on these and other data, an alternative (though not mutually exclusive) account is that naturalistic action errors in LCVA are also a consequence of deficits in general attentional resource availability or allocation. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a large group of 51 individuals with LCVA who had completed a test of naturalistic action, along with a battery of tests assessing praxis, attention allocation and control, reasoning, and language abilities to determine which of these capacities contribute uniquely to naturalistic action impairments. Using a regularized regression method, we found that naturalistic action impairments are predicted by both praxis deficits (hand posture sequencing and gesture recognition), as well as attention allocation and control deficits (orienting and dividing attention), along with language comprehension ability and age. Using support vector regression-lesion symptom mapping (SVR-LSM), we also demonstrated that naturalistic action impairments are associated with lesions to posterior middle temporal gyrus and anterior inferior parietal lobule regions known to be implicated in praxis; as well the middle frontal gyrus that has been implicated in both praxis and attention allocation and control. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that naturalistic action impairments in LCVA are a consequence of apraxia as well as deficits in attention allocation and control.

">Startling acoustic stimuli hasten choice reaching tasks by strengthening, but not changing the timing of, express visuomotor responses</a></h4>

              
                Responding to an external stimulus takes ~200 ms, but this can be shortened to as little as ~120 ms with the additional presentation of a startling acoustic stimulus. This StartReact phenomenon is hypothesized to arise from the involuntary release of a fully prepared movement. However, a startling acoustic stimulus also expedites rapid mid-flight, reactive adjustments to unpredictably displaced targets which could not have been prepared in advance. We surmise that for such rapid visuomotor transformations, intersensory facilitation may occur between auditory signals arising from the startling acoustic stimulus and visual signals relayed along a fast subcortical network. To explore this, we examined the StartReact phenomenon in a task that produces express visuomotor responses, which are brief bursts of muscle activity that arise from a fast tectoreticulospinal network. We measured express visuomotor responses on upper limb muscles in humans as they reached either toward or away from a stimulus in blocks of trials where movements could either be fully prepared or not, occasionally pairing stimulus presentation with a startling acoustic stimulus. The startling acoustic stimulus reliably produced larger but fixed-latency express visuomotor responses in a target-selective manner. Consistent with the StartReact phenomenon, it shortened reaction times, which were as fast for prepared and unprepared movements. Our results confirm that the StartReact phenomenon can be elicited for reactive movements without any motor preparation, consistent with intersensory facilitation. We propose the reticular formation to be the likely node for intersensory convergence during the most rapid transformations of vision into targeted reaching actions.

                Lipid changes in the brain have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. To facilitate comparative lipidomic research across brain-diseases we established a data commons named the Neurolipid Atlas, that we have pre-populated with novel human, mouse and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived lipidomics data for different brain diseases. We show that iPSC-derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes display distinct lipid profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Leveraging multiple datasets, we show that the AD risk gene ApoE4 drives cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation in human astrocytes recapitulating CE accumulation measured in the human AD brain. Multi-omic interrogation of iPSC-derived astrocytes revealed that cholesterol plays a major role in astrocyte interferon-dependent pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation. We show that through enhanced cholesterol esterification ApoE4 suppresses immune activation of astrocytes. Our novel data commons, available at neurolipidatlas.com, provides a user-friendly tool and knowledge base for a better understanding of lipid dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.

">A novel behavioral paradigm using mice to study predictive postural control</a></h4>

              
                Postural control circuitry performs the essential function of maintaining balance and body position in response to perturbations that are either self-generated (e.g. reaching to pick up an object) or externally delivered (e.g. being pushed by another person). Human studies have shown that anticipation of predictable postural disturbances can modulate such responses. This indicates that postural control could involve higher-level neural structures associated with predictive functions, rather than being purely reactive. However, the underlying neural circuitry remains largely unknown. To enable studies of predictive postural control circuits, we developed a novel task for mice. In this task, modeled after human studies, a dynamic platform generated reproducible translational perturbations. While mice stood bipedally atop a perch to receive water rewards, they experienced backward translations that were either unpredictable or preceded by an auditory cue. To validate the task, we investigated the effect of the auditory cue on postural responses to perturbations across multiple days in three mice. These preliminary results serve to validate a new postural control model, opening the door to the types of neural recordings and circuit manipulations that are currently possible only in mice.

">Orthogonalization of spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity by hierarchical neocortical areal network in primates</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how biological neural networks perform reliable information processing in the presence of intensive spontaneous activity (1-3) is an essential question in biological computation. Stimulus-evoked and spontaneous activities show orthogonal (dissimilar) patterns in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice (4-6), which is likely to be beneficial for separating sensory signals from internally generated noise (5, 7-12); however, those in V1 of carnivores and primates show highly similar patterns (3, 13-17). Consequently, the mechanism of segregation of stimulus information and internally generated noise in carnivores and primates remain unclear. To address this question, we used primate-optimized functional imaging (18) to precisely compare spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activities in multiple areas of the marmoset visual cortical pathway (19). In marmoset V1, but not in mouse V1, spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity shared similar activity patterns, suggesting a function of spontaneous activity specific to mammals with functional columns. However, in the higher-order visual areas of marmosets, spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activities exhibited dissimilar patterns. Analysis of neural activity geometry further revealed progressive orthogonalization of the two types of activities along the cortical hierarchy in marmosets, which reached a level comparable to that of mouse V1. Thus, orthogonalization of spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity is a general principle of cortical computation, which, in primates, is implemented by the hierarchical areal network.

">Unsilenced inhibitory cortical ensemble gates remote memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Acquired information can be consolidated to remote memory for storage but persists in a dormant state until its retrieval. However, it remains unknown how dormant memory is reactivated. Using a combination of simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and holographic optogenetics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in vivo, we discover a subset of GABAergic neurons that are specifically associated with dormant memory retrieval. These interneurons display persistent activity and inter-neuronal synchronization at the remote memory stage. In the absence of natural contextual cues, directly activating these interneurons reliably recalls cortical ensembles relevant to remote memory retrieval with context specificity. Conversely, targeted volumetric inactivation of these neurons suppresses context-induced memory retrieval. Our results reveal an unexpected role of unsilenced inhibitory cortical ensembles in causally gating the retrievability of dormant remote memory.

">1.94 Angstrom structure of synthetic alpha-synuclein fibrils seeding MSA neuropathology</a></h4>

              
                Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology, typically affecting individuals aged 50-60 and leading to patient death within a decade. Characterized by the presence of oligodendroglial intracellular aggregates (GCIs) primarily composed of fibrillar alpha-synuclein (aSyn), formation of MSA neuropathology presents similarities to prion propagation. While previous investigations have scrutinized fibrils extracted from MSA brains11, their 'protein-only' replication was questioned and their capacity to induce GCIs in animal models was not explored. Conversely, the synthetic fibril strain 1B assembled from recombinant human aSyn self-replicates autonomously in vitro and induces GCIs in mice, suggesting relevance to MSA. Here we report the high-resolution structural analysis of the 1B fibrils revealing similarities with human brain extracted MSA aSyn filaments, particularly the lack of a specific Thioflavin T (ThT) binding pocket. In addition, 1B causes sustained intracerebral GCI spread over the years, prompt lethality in transgenic mice, and transmission of inclusion pathology to wild-type animals after crude brain homogenate inoculation. This points to an underlying prion-like seeding process which we demonstrate in situ using correlative light-electron microscopy. Our findings underscore structural features of aSyn fibrils pivotal for MSA pathogenesis and provide insights for therapeutic development.

">Enhanced purinergic signaling in the paraventricular hypothalamus induces hyperphagic obesity and insulin resistance</a></h4>

              
                Body energy homeostasis is tightly regulated by hypothalamic neural circuits. However, their remodeling upon metabolic stress remains incompletely characterized, translating to unprecedented challenges to develop safe medications against the surge of metabolic diseases. Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) are one of the key appetite-suppressing effectors within the melanocortin system. In this work, we report that metabolic stress in mice evokes spatiotemporally selective ATP release (Inflares) from PVH astrocytes, accompanied with the expression of hematopoietic lineage-specific ADP/ATP receptor P2Y12 on OXT (PVHOXT) neurons. Importantly, "ectopic" emergence of P2Y12 on OXT neurons of patients with diabetes mellitus suggests an evolutionary conserved purinergic response to metabolic stress. Strikingly, increased purinergic signaling leads to impaired responsiveness of PVHOXT neurons accompanied with hyperphagic obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, nasal administration of clinically approved doses of P2Y12 inhibitors counteracts diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice and spontaneous weight gain in monkeys, paving the way for their application in patients with metabolic disorders.

">Sex-specific loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and mass in the auditory brainstem of a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Sound sensitivity is one of the most common sensory complaints for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). How and why sounds are perceived as overwhelming by affected people is unknown. To process sound information properly, the brain requires high activity and fast processing, as seen in areas like the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem. Recent work has shown dysfunction in mitochondria, which are the primary source of energy in cells, in a genetic model of ASD, Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Whether mitochondrial functions are also altered in sound-processing neurons, has not been characterized yet. To address this question, we imaged the MNTB in a mouse model of FXS. We stained MNTB brain slices from wild-type and FXS mice with two mitochondrial markers, TOMM20 and PMPCB, located on the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane and in the matrix, respectively. These markers allow exploration of mitochondrial subcompartments. Our integrated imaging pipeline reveals significant sex-specific differences in the degree of mitochondrial length in FXS. Significant differences are also observable in the overall number of mitochondria in male FXS mice, however, colocalization analyses between TOMM20 and PMPCB reveal that the integrity of these compartments is most disrupted in female FXS mice. We highlight a quantitative fluorescence microscopy pipeline to monitor mitochondrial functions in the MNTB from control or FXS mice and provide four complementary readouts. Our approach paves the way to understanding how cellular mechanisms important to sound encoding are altered in ASDs.

">A 3.5-minute-long reading-based fMRI localizer for the language network</a></h4>

              
                The field of human cognitive neuroscience is increasingly acknowledging inter-individual differences in the precise locations of functional areas and the corresponding need for individual-level analyses in fMRI studies. One approach to identifying functional areas and networks within individual brains is based on robust and extensively validated 'localizer' paradigms--contrasts of conditions that aim to isolate some mental process of interest. Here, we present a new version of a localizer for the fronto-temporal language-selective network. This localizer is similar to a commonly-used localizer based on the reading of sentences and nonword sequences (Fedorenko et al., 2010) but uses speeded presentation (200ms per word/nonword). Based on a direct comparison between the standard version (450ms per word/nonword) and the speeded versions of the language localizer in 24 participants, we show that a single run of the speeded localizer (3.5 min) is highly effective at identifying the language-selective areas: indeed, it is more effective than the standard localizer given that it leads to an increased response to the critical (sentence) condition and a decreased response to the control (nonwords) condition. This localizer may therefore become the version of choice for identifying the language network in neurotypical adults or special populations (as long as they are proficient readers), especially when time is of essence.

">Transdiagnostic Neurobiology of Social Cognition and Individual Variability as Measured by Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation in Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) is a validated measure of resting-state spontaneous brain activity. Previous fALFF findings in autism and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (ASDs and SSDs) have been highly heterogeneous. We aimed to use fALFF in a large sample of typically developing control (TDC), ASD and SSD participants to explore group differences and relationships with inter-individual variability of fALFF maps and social cognition. fALFF from 495 participants (185 TDC, 68 ASD, and 242 SSD) was computed using functional magnetic resonance imaging as signal power within two frequency bands (i.e., slow-4 and slow-5), normalized by the power in the remaining frequency spectrum. Permutation analysis of linear models was employed to investigate the relationship of fALFF with diagnostic groups, higher-level social cognition, and lower-level social cognition. For each participant, the average distance of fALFF map to all others was defined as a variability score, with higher scores indicating less typical maps. Lower fALFF in the visual and higher fALFF in the frontal regions were found in both SSD and ASD participants compared with TDCs. Limited differences were observed between ASD and SSD participants in the cuneus regions only. Associations between slow-4 fALFF and higher-level social cognitive scores across the whole sample were observed in the lateral occipitotemporal and temporoparietal junction. Individual variability within the ASD and SSD groups was also significantly higher compared with TDC. Similar patterns of fALFF and individual variability in ASD and SSD suggest some common neurobiological deficits across these related heterogeneous conditions.

	<p>Mitral cells (MCs) in the main olfactory bulb relay odor information to higher-order olfactory centers by encoding the information in the form of action potentials. The firing patterns of these cells are influenced by both their intrinsic properties and their synaptic connections within the neural network. However, reports on MC firing patterns have been inconsistent, and the mechanisms underlying these patterns remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse brain slices, we discovered that MCs exhibit two types of integrative behavior: regular/rhythmic firing and bursts of action potentials. These firing patterns could be transformed both spontaneously and chemically. MCs with regular firing maintained their pattern even in the presence of blockers of fast synaptic transmission, indicating this was an intrinsic property. However, regular firing could be transformed into bursting by applying GABAA receptor antagonists to block inhibitory synaptic transmission. Burst firing could be reverted to regular firing by blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors, rather than applying a GABAA receptor agonist, indicating that ionotropic glutamatergic transmission mediated this transformation. Further experiments on long-lasting currents (LLCs), which generated burst firing, also supported this mechanism. In addition, cytoplasmic Ca2+ in MCs was involved in the transformation of firing patterns mediated by glutamatergic transmission. Metabotropic glutamate receptors also played a role in LLCs in MCs. These pieces of evidence indicate that odor information can be encoded on a mitral cell (MC) platform, where it can be relayed to higher-order olfactory centers through intrinsic and dendrodendritic mechanisms in MCs.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathology including amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau). Factors initiating or driving these pathologies remain unclear, though microbes have been increasingly implicated. Our data and others&amp;amp;rsquo; findings indicate that microbes may be common constituents of the brain. It is notable that A&amp;amp;beta; and tau have antimicrobial properties, suggesting a response to microbes in the brain. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare major bacterial phyla in post-mortem tissues from individuals exhibiting a range of neuropathology and cognitive status in two brain regions variably affected in AD. Our data indicate that strong regional differences exist, driven in part by the varied presence of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We confirmed our data using ELISA of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid in the same brain tissue. We identified a potential association between the composition of phyla and the presence of neuropathology but not cognitive status. Declining cognition and increasing pathology correlated closely with serum LPS, but not brain levels of LPS, although brain LPS showed a strong negative correlation with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Collectively, our data suggest a region-specific heterogeneity of microbial populations in brain tissue potentially associated with neurodegenerative pathology.</p>

	<p>This study aims to understand the cognitive profiles of cerebellar infarction patients and compare them to those with supratentorial infarctions, particularly frontal infarctions. This current study also aims to find reliable assessment tools for detecting cognitive impairment in cerebellar infarction patients. A total of fifty cerebellar infarction patients, sixty supratentorial infarction patients, and thirty-nine healthy controls were recruited. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Addenbrooke&amp;amp;rsquo;s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), and Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome scale (CCAS-s) were used to assess global cognitive function. An extensive neuropsychological assessment battery was also tested to evaluate the characteristics of each cognitive domain. To assess the features of cognitive function, a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation tool was also utilized. The cerebral infarction patients demonstrated cognitive impairment comparable to those with frontal infarcts, notably characterized by disturbance in attention and executive function. However, the degree of cognitive impairment was comparatively milder in cerebellar infarction patients. Furthermore, the patients in the cerebellar group had worse scores in the ACE-III and CCAS-s compared to healthy controls. The two assessments also demonstrated a significant area under the curve values, indicating their effectiveness in distinguishing cognitive impairment in cerebellar infarctions. In conclusion, cognitive impairment in a cerebellar infarction resembles frontal lobe dysfunction but is generally mild. It can be accurately assessed using the ACE-III and CCAS-s scales.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-731/v1?src=rss">Differential physical interactions of wild-type and S59L mutant CHCHD10 with mitochondrial proteases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background CHCHD10 is a small mitochondrial protein with a C-terminal coiled-coil-helix–coiled-coil-helix domain. The N-terminal region of CHCHD10 is mostly intrinsically disordered. Therefore, CHCHD10 has no catalytic activity other than protein-protein interactions through the CHCH domain or intrinsically disordered region. The S59L mutation in CHCHD10 has been identified as a genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. However, the disease-causing mechanisms of CHCHD10S59L are not yet fully understood. Our previous study showed that CHCHD10S59L induces PINK1 and Parkin accumulation. PINK1 stabilization in the mitochondria is dependent on proteolytic processing by mitochondrial proteases. It has also been reported that mutant CHCHD10 disrupts protein homeostasis within mitochondria. Therefore, we hypothesized that CHCHD10S59L physically interacts with mitochondrial proteases during the disease pathogenesis. Methods To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using transiently transfected wild-type and mutant S59L CHCHD10 in HeLa cells. We employed a dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) cross-linker to detect transient physical interactions. Results We expected that CHCHD10S59L may activate mitochondrial protease processing or expression and that it interacts with more diverse mitochondrial proteases than the wild type. In general, however, there was no difference in the expression and processing levels of mitochondrial proteases and the proteases that interact with wild-type and CHCHD10S59L. LonP1 degrading unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix was the major proteases that can bind to wild-type CHCHD10 and CHCHD10S59L. LonP1 and HtrA2 were significantly less strongly bound to CHCHD10S59L. Conclusions This result can be interpreted in many different ways, including the regulatory role of CHCHD10 in mitochondrial proteases. However, more precise biochemical and cell biological investigations are required to determine the role of CHCHD10 in the activity of mitochondrial proteases, mechanism of PINK1 stabilization, and disruption of mitochondrial proteostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-730/v1?src=rss">Assessment of COMMUNITY Pharmacists' Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Towards Oral Health Care in Jordan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Community chemists now provide more professional and public health care, which is beneficial to the community, in addition to traditional medication distribution. While community pharmacists play a vital role in maintaining and promoting health, further research is required to accurately evaluate their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward oral health care among Jordanian pharmacists in northern Jordan. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire in Arabic language, targeting 250 community pharmacists in four cities (Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun, and Al-Mafraq) in northern Jordan. The questionnaire comprised four domains: socio-demographic, knowledge, attitudes and practice concerning oral health care. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0 was used to analyze the collected data, and the significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05. Results A total of 198 respondents returned the survey form, returning a response rate of 79.2%. Community pharmacists showed a good knowledge score of 58.2%. Only 40.9% said periodontal disease was the most frequent cause of tooth loss. The majority lacked knowledge of the optimal fluoride levels in toothpaste. The average attitude score was 71.05%. The most common oral health issues raised by patients were gingivitis and toothache (43.4% and 38.9%), respectively. Conclusion Community pharmacists have the general knowledge and attitude needed to play a significant role in providing dental care counselling to patients dental care. Nonetheless, community pharmacists stated they needed education and training to improve their practice. Continuing education courses related to oral health are recommended to reduce the risk of oral diseases and improve quality of life.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) commonly affects individuals within the working age group, often resulting in unemployment, particularly in low- to middle-income countries. The purpose of the study was to determine the return to work (RTW) rate of individuals with CVD after cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and the impact of impairment and socio-demographics on the individual’s ability to (RTW). Methods A cross-sectional survey, namely the Work Rehabilitation Questionnaire (WORQ) was used to gather the information. The IBM SPSS software (version 25) was used to manage the statistical analysis. Individuals who completed a CR program between the ages of 18 and 64 years made up a sample of 63 research participants. Results The RTW rate reported that only 30 (47.6%) of the participants successfully RTW after CR and 33 (52.4%) of participants did not RTW. The results also indicated that the older the individual and the higher the degree of impairment experienced, the less likely RTW would occur. Conclusion Factors such as the age and level of functional impairment of the individual with CVD must be addressed more aggressively in CR programs, particularly if the goal of the individual with CVD is to RTW.

                Gender equality in decision-making positions is crucial to achieving the goals of good governance, peace, democracy, and inclusive/sustainable development. The major aim of this research article is to investigate the representation trend of women in higher decision-making positions over the last thirty years, since 1991. The federal three organs of government (law formulating, law enforcing, and law interpreting bodies) were the focus of this research. This research is a mixed type of research that inculcates both qualitative and quantitative data types. Secondary data sources from relevant government institutions were mostly used. The data was analyzed through content analysis of documents and presented via descriptive data presenting techniques. The research findings reveal that although women’s representation in positions of decision-making has advanced considerably in recent years, the empirical data throughout the previous thirty years demonstrated the underrepresentation of women in higher leadership positions within the Ethiopian federal government. Furthermore, Women never held certain higher-level government leadership positions, such as the Prime Minister position, which seems to be forbidden for women. Women made up 23%, 19%, 19%, and 24% of the House of Peoples Representatives (HPR), the House of Federation (HoF), ministerial posts, and judicial bodies, respectively over the last three decades. Women are visibly underrepresented in the executive positions as compared to others. Thus, substantial policy and practical initiatives are needed to remove institutional, social, and economic barriers to boost women’s advanced visibility in senior leadership roles.

                <p>by Paul Schmidt-Barbo, Gabriel Kalweit, Mehdi Naouar, Lisa Paschold, Edith Willscher, Christoph Schultheiß, Bruno Märkl, Stefan Dirnhofer, Alexandar Tzankov, Mascha Binder, Maria Kalweit</p>

The classification of B cell lymphomas—mainly based on light microscopy evaluation by a pathologist—requires many years of training. Since the B cell receptor (BCR) of the lymphoma clonotype and the microenvironmental immune architecture are important features discriminating different lymphoma subsets, we asked whether BCR repertoire next-generation sequencing (NGS) of lymphoma-infiltrated tissues in conjunction with machine learning algorithms could have diagnostic utility in the subclassification of these cancers. We trained a random forest and a linear classifier via logistic regression based on patterns of clonal distribution, VDJ gene usage and physico-chemical properties of the top-n most frequently represented clonotypes in the BCR repertoires of 620 paradigmatic lymphoma samples—nodular lymphocyte predominant B cell lymphoma (NLPBL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)—alongside with 291 control samples. With regard to DLBCL and CLL, the models demonstrated optimal performance when utilizing only the most prevalent clonotype for classification, while in NLPBL—that has a dominant background of non-malignant bystander cells—a broader array of clonotypes enhanced model accuracy. Surprisingly, the straightforward logistic regression model performed best in this seemingly complex classification problem, suggesting linear separability in our chosen dimensions. It achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.84 on a test cohort including 125 samples from all three lymphoma entities and 58 samples from healthy individuals. Together, we provide proof-of-concept that at least the 3 studied lymphoma entities can be differentiated from each other using BCR repertoire NGS on lymphoma-infiltrated tissues by a trained machine learning model.

The vegetative insecticidal protein Vip3Aa from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) has been produced by transgenic crops to counter pest resistance to the widely used crystalline (Cry) insecticidal proteins from Bt. To proactively manage pest resistance, there is an urgent need to better understand the genetic basis of resistance to Vip3Aa, which has been largely unknown. We discovered that retrotransposon-mediated alternative splicing of a midgut-specific chitin synthase gene was associated with 5,560-fold resistance to Vip3Aa in a laboratory-selected strain of the fall armyworm, a globally important crop pest. The same mutation in this gene was also detected in a field population. Knockout of this gene via CRISPR/Cas9 caused high levels of resistance to Vip3Aa in fall armyworm and 2 other lepidopteran pests. The insights provided by these results could help to advance monitoring and management of pest resistance to Vip3Aa.

                <p>by Bernardo Antunes, Caroline Zanchi, Paul R. Johnston, Bar Maron, Christopher Witzany, Roland R. Regoes, Zvi Hayouka, Jens Rolff</p>

The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become a major threat to public health, requiring swift initiatives for discovering new strategies to control bacterial infections. Hence, antibiotic stewardship and rapid diagnostics, but also the development, and prudent use, of novel effective antimicrobial agents are paramount. Ideally, these agents should be less likely to select for resistance in pathogens than currently available conventional antimicrobials. The usage of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), key components of the innate immune response, and combination therapies, have been proposed as strategies to diminish the emergence of resistance. Herein, we investigated whether newly developed random antimicrobial peptide mixtures (RPMs) can significantly reduce the risk of resistance evolution in vitro to that of single sequence AMPs, using the ESKAPE pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>) as a model gram-negative bacterium. Infections of this pathogen are difficult to treat due the inherent resistance to many drug classes, enhanced by the capacity to form biofilms. <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> was experimentally evolved in the presence of AMPs or RPMs, subsequentially assessing the extent of resistance evolution and cross-resistance/collateral sensitivity between treatments. Furthermore, the fitness costs of resistance on bacterial growth were studied and whole-genome sequencing used to investigate which mutations could be candidates for causing resistant phenotypes. Lastly, changes in the pharmacodynamics of the evolved bacterial strains were examined. Our findings suggest that using RPMs bears a much lower risk of resistance evolution compared to AMPs and mostly prevents cross-resistance development to other treatments, while maintaining (or even improving) drug sensitivity. This strengthens the case for using random cocktails of AMPs in favour of single AMPs, against which resistance evolved in vitro, providing an alternative to classic antibiotics worth pursuing.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We investigated whether patients with large infarct and the presence or absence of perfusion mismatch are associated with endovascular treatment benefit.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a post-hoc analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion with a Large Infarct (ANGEL-ASPECT) randomized trial, which enrolled patients within 24 hours of onset with ASPECTS 3 to 5 or ASPECTS 0 to 2 with an infarct core 70 to 100 ml. Mismatch ratio was defined as time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s cerebral volume/ischemic core volume, and mismatch volume was defined as T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s volume minus ischemic core volume. We divided patients into mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml, and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal distribution. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 425 patients included. In both the mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 395; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 31) and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 346; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 80), better 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes were found in the endovascular treatment group compared with the MM group (4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], common odds ratio [cOR], 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.001; 4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], cOR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively), but not in patients without mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (5 [3–6] vs 5 [4–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.3–4.1, <i>p</i> = 0.83), and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml (4 [3–6] vs 5 [3–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.60). However, no interaction effect was found in both subgroups (<i>p</i> interaction &gt;0.10).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment was more efficacious than MM in patients with mismatch profiles, but no treatment effect or interaction was noted in the no mismatch profile patients. However, the small sample size of patients with no mismatch may have underpowered our analysis. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by mismatch is warranted.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition that occurs commonly in children from infancy through adolescence and is a global health concern. Pediatric TBI presents with a bimodal age distribution, with very young children (0–4 years) and adolescents (15–19 years) more commonly injured. Because children's brains are still developing, there is increased vulnerability to the effects of head trauma, which results in entirely different patterns of injury than in adults. Pediatric TBI has a profound and lasting impact on a child's development and quality of life, resulting in long-lasting consequences to physical, cognitive, and emotional development. Chronic issues like learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and emotional disturbances can develop. Early intervention and ongoing support are critical for minimizing these long-term deficits. Many animal models of TBI exist, and each varies significantly, displaying different characteristics of clinical TBI. The neurodevelopment differs in the rodent from the human in timing and effect, so TBI outcomes in the juvenile rodent can thus vary from the human child. The current review compares findings from preclinical TBI work in juvenile and adult rodents to clinical TBI research in pediatric and adult humans. We focus on the four brain regions most affected by TBI: the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Each has its unique developmental projections and thus is impacted by TBI differently. This review aims to compare the healthy neurodevelopment of these four brain regions in humans to the developmental processes in rodents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25366?af=R">Gray matter alterations in Huntington's disease: A meta‐analysis of VBM neuroimaging studies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing neuroimaging studies have attempted to identify biomarkers of Huntington's disease (HD) progression. Here, we conducted voxel-based meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies on HD to investigate the evolution of gray matter volume (GMV) alterations and explore the effects of genetic and clinical features on GMV changes. A systematic review was performed to identify the relevant studies. Meta-analyses of whole-brain VBM studies were performed to assess the regional GMV changes in all HD mutation carriers, in presymptomatic HD (pre-HD), and in symptomatic HD (sym-HD). A quantitative comparison was performed between pre-HD and sym-HD. Meta-regression analyses were used to explore the effects of genetic and clinical features on GMV changes. Twenty-eight studies were included, comparing a total of 1811 HD mutation carriers [including 1150 pre-HD and 560 sym-HD] and 969 healthy controls (HCs). Pre-HD showed decreased GMV in the bilateral caudate nuclei, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri, middle temporal gyri, and left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus compared with HCs. Compared with pre-HD, GMV decrease in sym-HD extended to the bilateral median cingulate/paracingulate gyri, Rolandic operculum and middle occipital gyri, left amygdala, and superior temporal gyrus. Meta-regression analyses found that age, mean lengths of CAG repeats, and disease burden were negatively associated with GMV atrophy of the bilateral caudate and right insula in all HD mutation carriers. This meta-analysis revealed the pattern of GMV changes from pre-HD to sym-HD, prompting the understanding of HD progression. The pattern of GMV changes may be biomarkers for disease progression in HD.</p>

                Solid pseudo-papillary tumors (SPT) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms accounting for less than 2% of all pancreatic tumors and primarily affecting young women. They are generally characterized by a clinical and radiological polymorphism. In most cases, complete surgical resection is curative. We report a case of a young woman presenting with a pancreatic tumor revealed through a vague non-specific abdominal pain. The diagnosis was based on the histological examination of the surgically-removed piece.

                We studied lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inflammasome. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + palmitic acid (PA) decreased lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>) and increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> through mitochondrial ROS, which was suppressed in <i>Trpm2</i>-KO macrophages. Inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were ameliorated by <i>Trpm2</i> KO. ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling occurred after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release whose blockade attenuated LPS + PA-induced inflammasome. Subsequently, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry (SOCE) was activated whose inhibition suppressed inflammasome. SOCE was coupled with K<sup>+</sup> efflux whose inhibition reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) and impaired [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery. LPS + PA activated KCa3.1 channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel. Inhibitors of KCa3.1 channel or <i>Kcnn4</i> KO reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>, attenuated increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or inflammasome activation by LPS + PA, and ameliorated HFD-induced inflammasome or metabolic inflammation. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release induced delayed JNK and ASC phosphorylation through CAMKII-ASK1. These results suggest a novel role of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sustained by ER<b>→</b>lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1 channel in inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation.

                The hippocampal-dependent memory system and striatal-dependent memory system modulate reinforcement learning depending on feedback timing in adults, but their contributions during development remain unclear. In a 2-year longitudinal study, 6-to-7-year-old children performed a reinforcement learning task in which they received feedback immediately or with a short delay following their response. Children’s learning was found to be sensitive to feedback timing modulations in their reaction time and inverse temperature parameter, which quantifies value-guided decision-making. They showed longitudinal improvements towards more optimal value-based learning, and their hippocampal volume showed protracted maturation. Better delayed model-derived learning covaried with larger hippocampal volume longitudinally, in line with the adult literature. In contrast, a larger striatal volume in children was associated with both better immediate and delayed model-derived learning longitudinally. These findings show, for the first time, an early hippocampal contribution to the dynamic development of reinforcement learning in middle childhood, with neurally less differentiated and more cooperative memory systems than in adults.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90313">Atypical local and global biological motion perception in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a></h4>

              
                Perceiving biological motion (BM) is crucial for human survival and social interaction. Many studies have reported impaired BM perception in autism spectrum disorder, which is characterised by deficits in social interaction. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit similar difficulties in social interaction. However, few studies have investigated BM perception in children with ADHD. Here, we compared differences in the ability to process local kinematic and global configurational cues, two fundamental abilities of BM perception, between typically developing and ADHD children. We further investigated the relationship between BM perception and social interaction skills measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and examined the contributions of latent factors (e.g. sex, age, attention, and intelligence) to BM perception. The results revealed that children with ADHD exhibited atypical BM perception. Local and global BM processing showed distinct features. Local BM processing ability was related to social interaction skills, whereas global BM processing ability significantly improved with age. Critically, general BM perception (i.e. both local and global BM processing) may be affected by sustained attentional ability in children with ADHD. This relationship was primarily mediated by reasoning intelligence. These findings elucidate atypical BM perception in ADHD and the latent factors related to BM perception. Moreover, this study provides new evidence that BM perception is a hallmark of social cognition and advances our understanding of the potential roles of local and global processing in BM perception and social cognitive disorders.

                While the involvement of actin polymerization in cell migration is well-established, much less is known about the role of transmembrane water flow in cell motility. Here, we investigate the role of water influx in a prototypical migrating cell, the neutrophil, which undergoes rapid, directed movement to sites of injury, and infection. Chemoattractant exposure both increases cell volume and potentiates migration, but the causal link between these processes are not known. We combine single-cell volume measurements and a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify the regulators of chemoattractant-induced neutrophil swelling, including NHE1, AE2, PI3K-gamma, and CA2. Through NHE1 inhibition in primary human neutrophils, we show that cell swelling is both necessary and sufficient for the potentiation of migration following chemoattractant stimulation. Our data demonstrate that chemoattractant-driven cell swelling complements cytoskeletal rearrangements to enhance migration speed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92543">Systemic pharmacological suppression of neural activity reverses learning impairment in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                The enhancement of associative synaptic plasticity often results in impaired rather than enhanced learning. Previously, we proposed that such learning impairments can result from saturation of the plasticity mechanism (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017), or, more generally, from a history-dependent change in the threshold for plasticity. This hypothesis was based on experimental results from mice lacking two class I major histocompatibility molecules, MHCI H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>), which have enhanced associative long-term depression at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum (PF-Purkinje cell LTD). Here, we extend this work by testing predictions of the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis in a second mouse line with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Mice lacking <i>Fmr1</i> gene expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells (L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO) were selectively impaired on two oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been implicated, with no impairment on LTD-independent oculomotor learning tasks. Consistent with the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis, behavioral pre-training designed to reverse LTD at the PF-Purkinje cell synapses eliminated the oculomotor learning deficit in the L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, as previously reported in MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>mice. In addition, diazepam treatment to suppress neural activity and thereby limit the induction of associative LTD during the pre-training period also eliminated the learning deficits in L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. These results support the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD-dependent learning is governed by an experience-dependent sliding threshold for plasticity. An increased threshold for LTD in response to elevated neural activity would tend to oppose firing rate stability, but could serve to stabilize synaptic weights and recently acquired memories. The metaplasticity perspective could inform the development of new clinical approaches for addressing learning impairments in autism and other disorders of the nervous system.

">Self-organizing recruitment of compensatory areas maximizes residual motor performance post-stroke</a></h4>

              
                Whereas the orderly recruitment of compensatory motor cortical areas after stroke depends on the size of the motor cortex lesion affecting arm and hand movements, the mechanisms underlying this reorganization are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the recruitment of compensatory areas results from the motor system's goal to optimize performance given the anatomical constraints before and after the lesion. This optimization is achieved through two complementary plastic processes: a homeostatic regulation process, which maximizes information transfer in sensory-motor networks, and a reinforcement learning process, which minimizes movement error and effort. To test this hypothesis, we developed a neuro-musculoskeletal model that controls a 7-muscle planar arm via a cortical network that includes a primary motor cortex and a premotor cortex that directly project to spinal motor neurons, and a contra-lesional primary motor cortex that projects to spinal motor neurons via the reticular formation. Synapses in the cortical areas are updated via reinforcement learning and the activity of spinal motor neurons is adjusted through homeostatic regulation. The model replicated neural, muscular, and behavioral outcomes in both non-lesioned and lesioned brains. With increasing lesion sizes, the model demonstrated systematic recruitment of the remaining primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and contra-lesional cortex. The premotor cortex acted as a reserve area for fine motor control recovery, while the contra-lesional cortex helped avoid paralysis at the cost of poor joint control. Plasticity in spinal motor neurons enabled force generation after large cortical lesions despite weak corticospinal inputs. Compensatory activity in the premotor and contra-lesional motor cortex was more prominent in the early recovery period, gradually decreasing as the network minimized effort. Thus, the orderly recruitment of compensatory areas following strokes of varying sizes results from biologically plausible local plastic processes that maximize performance, whether the brain is intact or lesioned.

">Myelin-informed forward models for M/EEG source reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) provide direct electrophysiological measures at an excellent temporal resolution, but the spatial resolution of source-reconstructed current activity is limited to several millimetres. Here we show, using simulations of MEG signals and Bayesian model comparison, that non-invasive myelin estimates from high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can enhance MEG/EEG source reconstruction. Our approach assumes that MEG/EEG signals primarily arise from the synchronised activity of pyramidal cells, and since most of the myelin in the cortical sheet originates from these cells, myelin density can predict the strength of cortical sources measured by MEG/EEG. Leveraging recent advances in quantitative MRI, we exploit this structure-function relationship and scale the leadfields of the forward model according to the local myelin density estimates from in vivo quantitative MRI to inform MEG/EEG source reconstruction. Using Bayesian model comparison and dipole localisation errors (DLEs), we demonstrate that adapting local forward fields to reflect increased local myelination at the site of a simulated source explains the simulated data better than models without such leadfield scaling. Our model comparison framework proves sensitive to myelin changes in simulations with exact coregistration and moderate-to-high sensor-level signal-to-noise ratios ([&ge;]10 dB) for the multiple sparse priors (MSP) and empirical Bayesian beamformer (EBB) approaches. Furthermore, we sought to infer the microstructure giving rise to specific functional activation patterns by comparing the myelin-informed model which was used to generate the activation with a set of test forward models incorporating different myelination patterns. We found that the direction of myelin changes, however not their magnitude, can be inferred by Bayesian model comparison. Finally, we apply myelin-informed forward models to MEG data from a visuo-motor experiment. We demonstrate improved source reconstruction accuracy using myelin estimates from a quantitative longitudinal relaxation (R1) map and discuss the limitations of our approach.

                Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that results from abnormal visual experience in early life. Amblyopia typically reduces visual performance in one eye. We studied the representation of visual motion information in area MT and nearby extrastriate visual areas in two monkeys made amblyopic by creating an artificial strabismus in early life, and in a single age-matched control monkey. Tested monocularly, cortical responses to moving dot patterns, gratings, and plaids were qualitatively normal in awake, fixating amblyopic monkeys, with primarily subtle differences between the eyes. However, the number of binocularly driven neurons was substantially lower than normal; of the neurons driven predominantly by one eye, the great majority responded only to stimuli presented to the fellow eye. The small population driven by the amblyopic eye showed reduced coherence sensitivity and a preference for faster speeds in much the same way as behavioral deficits. We conclude that, while we do find important differences between neurons driven by the two eyes, amblyopia does not lead to a large scale reorganization of visual receptive fields in the dorsal stream when tested through the amblyopic eye, but rather creates a substantial shift in eye preference toward the fellow eye.

">Critical roles of ERK and Akt signaling in metabolically dependent memory formation in Drosophila larvae.</a></h4>

              
                In the fruit fly Drosophila, memory formation is intricately linked to metabolic state. Our previous findings showed that the preferential support of memory under increased energy levels is mediated by the insulin receptor in the mushroom body (MB), a key memory center in the insect brain. This study analyzed the role of the insulin receptor's downstream pathways, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K/Akt, in metabolically dependent memory formation. We evaluated their impact on memory processes by employing RNA interference-mediated downregulation of key components, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (Akt), in the MB of Drosophila larvae. To enhance energy levels, larvae were fed sugar for 60 minutes prior to aversive olfactory conditioning. Our findings revealed that genetically downregulating ERK and Akt in the MB significantly impaired metabolically dependent memory formation, without affecting naive sensory perception or olfactory learning. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of active forms of ERK and Akt in the MB, underscoring their roles in modulating memory processes under elevated energy levels. The pivotal roles of these kinases suggest a broader implication of insulin signaling in memory formation under different metabolic conditions, and illuminate the connections between metabolic regulation and memory dynamics in the MB.

">Anatomical and functional analysis of the corticospinal tract in an FRDA mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is one of the most common hereditary ataxias. It is caused by a GAA repeat in the first intron of the FXN gene, which encodes an essential mitochondrial protein. Patients suffer from progressive motor dysfunction due to the degeneration of mechanoreceptive and proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and cerebellar dentate nucleus neurons, especially at early disease stages. Postmortem analyses of FRDA patients also indicate pathological changes in motor cortex including in the projection neurons that give rise to the cortical spinal tract (CST). Yet, it remains poorly understood how early in the disease cortical spinal neurons (CSNs) show these alterations, or whether CSN/CST pathology resembles the abnormalities observed in other tissues affected by FXN loss. To address these questions, we examined CSN driven motor behaviors and pathology in the YG8JR FRDA mouse model. We find that FRDA mice show impaired motor skills, exhibit significant reductions in CSN functional output, and, among other pathological changes, show abnormal mitochondrial distributions in CSN neurons and CST axonal tracts. Moreover, some of these alterations were observed as early as two months of age, suggesting that CSN/CST pathology may be an earlier event in FRDA disease than previously appreciated. These studies warrant a detailed mechanistic understanding of how FXN loss impacts CSN health and functionality.

">Towards a simplified model of primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been shown to predict neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1) better than classical models. However, this performance comes at the expense of simplicity because the ANN models typically have many hidden layers with many feature maps in each layer. Here we show that ANN models of V1 can be substantially simplified while retaining high predictive power. To demonstrate this, we first recorded a new dataset of over 29,000 neurons responding to up to 65,000 natural image presentations in mouse V1. We found that ANN models required only two convolutional layers for good performance, with a relatively small first layer. We further found that we could make the second layer small without loss of performance, by fitting a separate "minimodel" to each neuron. Similar simplifications applied for models of monkey V1 neurons. We show that these relatively simple models can nonetheless be useful for tasks such as object and visual texture recognition and we use the models to gain insight into how texture invariance arises in biological neurons.

">Rod-shaped microglia interact with neuronal dendrites to regulate cortical excitability in TDP-43 related neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortical hyperexcitability is well-documented in the presymptomatic stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the mechanisms underlying this early dysregulation are not fully understood. Microglia, as the principal immune cells of the central nervous system, have emerged as important players in sensing and regulating neuronal activity. Here we investigated the role of microglia in the motor cortical circuits in a mouse model of TDP-43 neurodegeneration (rNLS8). Utilizing multichannel probe recording and longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging in awake mice, we observed neuronal hyperactivity at the initial stage of disease progression. Spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that microglia are the primary responders to motor cortical hyperactivity. We further identified a unique subpopulation of microglia, rod-shaped microglia, which are characterized by a distinct morphology and transcriptional profile. Notably, rod-shaped microglia predominantly interact with neuronal dendrites and excitatory synaptic inputs to attenuate motor cortical hyperactivity. The elimination of rod-shaped microglia through TREM2 deficiency increased neuronal hyperactivity, exacerbated motor deficits, and further decreased survival rates of rNLS8 mice. Together, our results suggest that rod-shaped microglia play a neuroprotective role by attenuating cortical hyperexcitability in the mouse model of TDP-43 related neurodegeneration.

">Cerebral Microvascular Density, Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier, and Neuroinflammatory Responses Indicate Early Aging Characteristics in a Marfan Syndrome Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (Fbn1 ), where a Fbn1 missense mutation (Fbn1C1039G/+) can result in systemic increases in the bioavailability and signaling of transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}). In a well-established mouse model of MFS (Fbn1C1041G/+), pre-mature aging of the aortic wall and the progression of aortic root aneurysm are observed by 6-months-of-age. TGF-{beta} signaling has been implicated in cerebrovascular dysfunction, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and age-related neuroinflammation. We have reported that pre-mature vascular aging in MFS mice could extend to cerebrovasculature, where peak blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) of 6-month-old (6M) MFS mice was reduced, similarly to 12-month-old (12M) control mice. Case studies of MFS patients have documented neurovascular manifestations, including intracranial aneurysms, stroke, arterial tortuosity, as well as headaches and migraines, with reported incidence of pain and chronic fatigue. Despite these significant clinical observations, investigation into cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology in MFS remains limited. Using 6M-control (C57BL/6) and 6M-MFS (Fbn1C1041G/+) and healthy 12M-control male and female mice, we test the hypothesis that abnormal Fbn1 protein expression is associated with altered cerebral microvascular density, BBB permeability, and neuroinflammation in the PCA-perfused hippocampus, all indicative of a pre-mature aging brain phenotype. Using Glut1 staining, 6M-MFS mice and 12M-CTRL similarly present decreased microvascular density in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) regions of the hippocampus. 6M-MFS mice exhibit increased BBB permeability in the DG, CA1, and CA3 as evident by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining, which was more comparable to 12M-CTRL mice. 6M-MFS mice show a higher number of microglia in the hippocampus compared to age-matched control mice, a pattern resembling that of 12M-CTRL mice. This study represents the first known investigation into neuropathology in a mouse model of MFS and indicates that the pathophysiology underlying MFS leads to a systemic pre-mature aging phenotype. This study is crucial for identifying and understanding MFS-associated neurovascular and neurological abnormalities, underscoring the need for research aimed at improving the quality of life and managing pre-mature aging symptoms in MFS and related connective tissue disorders.

">Axonal Tau sorting depends on the PRR2 domain and 0N4R-specific interactions hint at distinct roles of Tau isoforms in synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Tau pathology is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related diseases, called tauopathies. While Tau is normally enriched in axons, somatodendritic missorting of the microtubule-associated protein is a key event in early disease development. Tau missorting promotes synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction but the mechanisms underlying both normal axonal sorting and pathological missorting remain unclear. Interestingly, the disease-associated Tau brain isoforms show different axodendritic distribution, but the distinct role of these isoforms in health and disease largely unknown. Here, we aimed to identify domains or motifs of Tau and cellular binding partners that are required for efficient axonal Tau sorting, and we studied the differences of the isoform-specific Tau interactome. By using human MAPT-KO induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons, we analyzed the sorting behavior of more than 20 truncated or phosphorylation-mutant Tau constructs, and we used TurboID-based proximity labelling and proteomics to identify sorting- and isoform-specific Tau interactors. We found that efficient axonal Tau sorting was independent of the N-terminal tail, the C-terminal repeat domains, and the general microtubule affinity of Tau. In contrast, the presence of the proline-rich region 2 (PRR2) was necessary for successful sorting. Our interactome data revealed peroxisomal accumulation of the Tau N-terminal half, while axonal Tau interacted with the PP2A activator HSP110. When we compared the interactome of 0N3R- and 0N4R-Tau, we observed specific interactions of 0N4R-Tau with regulators of presynaptic exocytosis and postsynaptic plasticity, which are partially associated with AD pathogenesis, such as members of the CDC42 pathway and the RAB11 proteins, while 0N3R-Tau bound to MAP4 and other cytoskeletal elements. In sum, our study postulates that axonal Tau sorting relies on the PRR2 domain but not on microtubule affinity, and unravels a potential isoform-specific role in synaptic function and AD-related dysfunction.

">Mixed recurrent connectivity architecture in primate prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The functional properties of a network depend on its connectivity, which includes the strength of its inputs and the strength of the connections between its units, or recurrent connectivity. Because we lack a detailed description of the recurrent connectivity in the lateral prefrontal cortex of primates, we developed an indirect method to estimate it. This method leverages the elevated noise correlation of mutually-connected units. To estimate the connectivity of prefrontal regions, we trained recurrent neural network models with varying percentages of bump attractor architecture and noise levels to match the noise correlation properties observed in two specific prefrontal regions: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the frontal eye field. We found that models initialized with approximately 20% and 7.5% bump attractor architecture closely matched the noise correlation properties of the frontal eye field and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. These findings suggest that the different percentages of bump attractor architecture may reflect distinct functional roles of these brain regions. Specifically, lower percentages of bump attractor units, associated with higher-dimensional representations, likely support more abstract neural representations in more anterior regions.

	<p>Epilepsy affects over 65 million people worldwide. One-third of people with epilepsy do not respond to medication and may benefit from surgery. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is the first neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. This method is used in combination with anti-seizure medications in adults and in the pediatric population. VNS has also been demonstrated to have benefits for some epilepsy comorbidities, such as depression, and can be used in combination with other neuromodulation therapies in epilepsy. The authors present an overview of VNS physiology, patient selection, surgery and risks, neuromodulation therapy, and application to epilepsy comorbidities.</p>

	<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway play pivotal roles in the resilience and action of antidepressant drugs, making them prominent targets in psychiatric research. Oxidative stress (OS) contributes to various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and mental illnesses, and exacerbates the aging process. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant responsive element (ARE) serves as the primary cellular defense mechanism against OS-induced brain damage. Thus, Nrf2 activation may confer endogenous neuroprotection against OS-related cellular damage; notably, the TrkB/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, stimulated by BDNF-dependent TrkB signaling, activates Nrf2 and promotes its nuclear translocation. However, insufficient neurotrophin support often leads to the downregulation of the TrkB signaling pathway in brain diseases. Thus, targeting TrkB activation and the Nrf2-ARE system is a promising therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Phytochemicals, including indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its metabolite, diindolylmethane (DIM), exhibit neuroprotective effects through BDNF&amp;amp;rsquo;s mimetic activity; Akt phosphorylation is induced, and the antioxidant defense mechanism is activated by blocking the Nrf2-kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) complex. This review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of I3C and its derivatives for concurrently activating neuronal defense mechanisms in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyze the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analyzing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research. Trial registration NCT06239740, February 2, 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov.

                <p>We must often decide whether the effort required for a task is worth the reward. Past rodent work suggests that willingness to deploy cognitive effort can be driven by individual differences in perceived reward value, depression, or chronic stress. However, many factors driving cognitive effort deployment&mdash;such as short-term memory ability&mdash;cannot easily be captured in rodents. Furthermore, we do not fully understand how individual differences in short-term memory ability, depression, chronic stress, and reward anticipation impact cognitive effort deployment for reward. Here, we examined whether these factors predict cognitive effort deployment for higher reward in an online visual short-term memory task. Undergraduate participants were grouped into high and low effort groups (<I>n</I><SUB>HighEffort</SUB> = 348, <I>n</I><SUB>LowEffort</SUB> = 81; <I>n</I><SUB>Female</SUB> = 332, <I>n</I><SUB>Male</SUB> = 92, <I>M</I><SUB>Age</SUB> = 20.37, <I>Range</I><SUB>Age</SUB> = 16&ndash;42) based on decisions in this task. After completing a monetary incentive task to measure reward anticipation, participants completed short-term memory task trials where they could choose to encode either fewer (low effort/reward) or more (high effort/reward) squares before reporting whether or not the color of a target square matched the square previously in that location. We found that only greater short-term memory ability predicted whether participants chose a much higher proportion of high versus low effort trials. Drift diffusion modeling showed that high effort group participants were more biased than low effort group participants toward selecting high effort trials. Our findings highlight the role of individual differences in cognitive effort ability in explaining cognitive effort deployment choices.</p>

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 can spread rapidly. Surgery in the oral cavity poses a high risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3rd February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Results The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusions Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water increased the CT value.

                Background and aim During the past decade, the frequency of extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis (TB) has increased. These forms are often miss-diagnosed. This statement of the TB epidemiological profile modification, conduct us to reflect about the utility of the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) in active TB detection. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy performance of the TST for active tuberculosis detection. Methods This was a case-control, multicenter study conducted in 11 anti-TB centers in Tunisia (June-November2014). The cases were adults aged between 18 and 55 years with newly diagnosed and confirmed tuberculosis. Controls were free from tuberculosis. A data collection sheet was filled out and a TST was performed for each participant. Diagnostic accuracy measures of TST were estimated using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) to estimate sensitivity and specificity of a determined cut-off point. Results Overall, 1050 patients were enrolled, composed of 336 cases and 714 controls. The mean age was 38.3±11.8 years for cases and 33.6±11 years for controls. The mean diameter of the TST induration was significantly higher among cases than controls (13.7mm vs.6.2mm; p=10-6). AUC was 0.789 [95% CI: 0.758-0.819; p=0.01], corresponding to a moderate discriminating performance for this test. The most discriminative cut-off value of the TST, which was associated with the best sensitivity (73.7%) and specificity (76.6%) couple was   ≥ 11 mm with a Youden index of 0.503. Positive and Negative predictive values were 3.11% and 99.52%, respectively. Conclusions TST could be a useful tool used for active tuberculosis detection, with a moderate global performance and accepted sensitivity and specificity at the cut-off point of 11 mm. However, it cannot be considered as a gold standard test due to its multiple disadvantages.

                Abstract* A 20’s primiparous woman, following spontaneous expulsion of intrauterine death of the fetus at 30 weeks of gestation, presented on post-partum day 8 with acute onset flaccid quadriparesis and breathing difficulty, which had rapidly progressed to involve the legs on day 3 up to her upper limbs on post-partum day 5. Following examination, Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) with ascending diaphragmatic involvement was diagnosed, and plasma exchange was initiated. She developed raised blood pressure, headache, sudden onset visual loss with 2 episodes of generalized seizures on post-partum day 14. Brain MRI and clinical suspicion helped diagnose Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). The patient was treated with anticonvulsants and antihypertensive agents. She regained her vision over the next two days, completed the treatment for GBS, and made a good recovery with independence for advanced activities of daily living on follow-up.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features adhesions caused by estrogen-dependent periodic bleeding. It is characterised by a widely spread fibrotic interstitium that comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibres, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis found outside the uterus. Thus, fibrosis is recognized as a critical component because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or non-cyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root cause, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, makes it challenging to diagnose early and to implement therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Research on understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still ongoing to find biomarkers and develop non-hormonal therapeutic approaches. Current clinical research indicates a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is thought to be tightly linked to pain, a major factor for the decline in the patient’s quality of life but little is known about the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways that lead to endometriosis-related fibrosis. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease to assess treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article’s goal is to examine recent developments in the field and pinpoint knowledge gaps that exist with a focus on the development of novel fibrotic mouse models for the early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and how this knowledge aids in the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments which opens fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.

                Background Sleep hygiene education (SHE) and lavender essential oil (LEO) inhalation are two effective strategies aimed at enhancing sleep quality and mood states. This study investigated the effects of a single SHE session combined with nightly LEO inhalation for 7 days of late-evening resistance training sessions on sleep quality and mood states in trained athletes. Methods Forty-two athletes were randomly assigned to four groups: a control group (CG), a SHE group (SHEG), a LEO group (LEOG), and a SHE + LEO group (CSLG). CG and LEOG maintained their sleep habits during the intervention, while SHEG and CSLG followed SHE recommendations. Additionally, LEOG and CSLG inhaled LEO nightly before sleep. Sleep patterns were recorded via actigraphy. The Brunel Mood Scale and the Hooper questionnaires were completed before and after the intervention. Results Sleep latency was lower in SHEG (p=0.001) and CSLG (p=0.012) compared to the CG. The subjective sleep score improved in SHEG, LEOG, and CSLG (p < 0.001), with greater improvement observed in SHEG (p = 0.002) and CSLG (p < 0.001) compared to CG at post-intervention. Additionally, significant improvements were observed in the Hooper index in the SHEG (p=0.048) and CSLG (p=0.027), with CSLG demonstrating higher scores compared to CG at the post-intervention assessment (p=0.026). Furthermore, the subjective fatigue score significantly decreased in the CSLG (p=0.009). Conclusions Combining SHE and LEO inhalation could be an effective strategy to enhance sleep latency, subjective sleep quality, and overall wellness, and reduce feelings of fatigue in trained athletes following late-evening resistance training sessions.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                Background The objective of this research is to propose a method for evaluating the effectiveness of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) schemes across different parameters and subsequently rank different cities based on the perception of resident citizens. The research contributes to the academic literature of urban management by suggesting a comprehensive evaluation model based on academic literature review, identifying an assessment method to assign criteria to the parameters of the selected evaluation model, and finally proposing an approach to rank select cities covered under AMRUT scheme based on the suggested quantified model. Methods Conceptual research model is suggested based on review of the past literature. The study further purposes a quantitative method Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to operationalize the identified model by assigning weights to the criteria. Finally, the research demonstrates how the weighted model can be applied to rank cities under AMRUT scheme by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Results Conceptual model to assess the effectiveness of AMRUT scheme has been arrived at by reviewing past literature. The model is found to be exhaustive and applicable for the research problem being investigated. The study further identifies the method for assigning the criteria weights and then eventually how to apply it to rank cities covered under AMRUT scheme on those weights. Conclusion The study contributes to the academic literature in the context of urban management by evaluating AMRUT scheme. The research proposes that impact of AMRUT can be studied by selecting a comprehensive evaluation model based on academic literature review, identifying an assessment method to assign criteria to the parameters of the selected evaluation model, and finally proposing a method to apply the weighted model to rank the cities covered under AMRUT scheme.

                <p>by Chrysovalantou Kalaitzidou, Georgios Grekas, Andreas Zilian, Charalambos Makridakis, Phoebus Rosakis</p>

We present a new model and extensive computations that explain the dramatic remodelling undergone by a fibrous collagen extracellular matrix (ECM), when subjected to contractile mechanical forces from embedded cells or cell clusters. This remodelling creates complex patterns, comprising multiple narrow localised bands of severe densification and fiber alignment, extending far into the ECM, often joining distant cells or cell clusters (such as tumours). Most previous models cannot capture this behaviour, as they assume stable mechanical fiber response with stress an increasing function of fiber stretch, and a restriction to small displacements. Our fully nonlinear network model distinguishes between two types of single-fiber nonlinearity: fibers that undergo stable (supercritical) buckling (as in previous work) versus fibers that suffer unstable (subcritical) buckling collapse. The model allows unrestricted, arbitrarily large displacements (geometric nonlinearity). Our assumptions on single-fiber instability are supported by recent simulations and experiments on buckling of individual beams with a hierarchical microstructure, such as collagen fibers. We use simple scenarios to illustrate, for the first time, two distinct compressive-instability mechanisms at work in our model: unstable buckling collapse of single fibers, and snap-through of multiple-fiber groups. The latter is possible even when single fibers are stable. Through simulations of large fiber networks, we show how these instabilities lead to spatially extended patterns of densification, fiber alignment and ECM remodelling induced by cell contraction. Our model is simple, but describes a very complex, multi-stable energy landscape, using sophisticated numerical optimisation methods that overcome the difficulties caused by instabilities in large systems. Our work opens up new ways of understanding the unique biomechanics of fibrous-network ECM, by fully accounting for nonlinearity and associated loss of stability in fiber networks. Our results provide new insights on tumour invasion and metastasis.

                <p>by Mahshid Fardadi, J. C. Leiter, Daniel C. Lu, Tetsuya Iwasaki</p>
Aim <p>After spinal cord injuries (SCIs), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI.</p> Methods <p>We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI.</p> Results <p>The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage.</p> Conclusion <p>Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012220">Co-existence of synaptic plasticity and metastable dynamics in a spiking model of cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiaoyu Yang, Giancarlo La Camera</p>

Evidence for metastable dynamics and its role in brain function is emerging at a fast pace and is changing our understanding of neural coding by putting an emphasis on hidden states of transient activity. Clustered networks of spiking neurons have enhanced synaptic connections among groups of neurons forming structures called cell assemblies; such networks are capable of producing metastable dynamics that is in agreement with many experimental results. However, it is unclear how a clustered network structure producing metastable dynamics may emerge from a fully local plasticity rule, i.e., a plasticity rule where each synapse has only access to the activity of the neurons it connects (as opposed to the activity of other neurons or other synapses). Here, we propose a local plasticity rule producing ongoing metastable dynamics in a deterministic, recurrent network of spiking neurons. The metastable dynamics co-exists with ongoing plasticity and is the consequence of a self-tuning mechanism that keeps the synaptic weights close to the instability line where memories are spontaneously reactivated. In turn, the synaptic structure is stable to ongoing dynamics and random perturbations, yet it remains sufficiently plastic to remap sensory representations to encode new sets of stimuli. Both the plasticity rule and the metastable dynamics scale well with network size, with synaptic stability increasing with the number of neurons. Overall, our results show that it is possible to generate metastable dynamics over meaningful hidden states using a simple but biologically plausible plasticity rule which co-exists with ongoing neural dynamics.

                <p>by Magdalena Miranda, Azul Silva, Juan Facundo Morici, Marcos Antonio Coletti, Mariano Belluscio, Pedro Bekinschtein</p>

Episodic memory is essential to navigate in a changing environment by recalling past events, creating new memories, and updating stored information from experience. Although the mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation have been profoundly studied, much less is known about memory retrieval. Hippocampal spatial representations are key for retrieval of contextually guided episodic memories. Indeed, hippocampal place cells exhibit stable location-specific activity which is thought to support contextual memory, but can also undergo remapping in response to environmental changes. It is unclear if remapping is directly related to the expression of different episodic memories. Here, using an incidental memory recognition task in rats, we showed that retrieval of a contextually guided memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear link between external cues, hippocampal remapping, and episodic memory retrieval that guides behavior. Furthermore, we describe NMDARs as key players in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes by controlling the reactivation of specific memory traces. While an increase in CA3 NMDAR activity boosts memory retrieval, dentate gyrus NMDAR activity enhances memory differentiation. Our results contribute to understanding how the hippocampal circuit sustains a flexible balance between memory formation and retrieval depending on the environmental cues and the internal representations of the individual. They also provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of hippocampal subregions to generate this balance.

                <p>by Emeline Dubois, Stéphanie Boisnard, Henri-Marc Bourbon, Kenza Yefsah, Karine Budin, Robert Debuchy, Liangran Zhang, Nancy Kleckner, Denise Zickler, Eric Espagne</p>

We show here that in the fungus <i>Sordaria macrospora</i>, the meiosis-specific HORMA-domain protein Hop1 is not essential for the basic early events of chromosome axis development, recombination initiation, or recombination-mediated homolog coalignment/pairing. In striking contrast, Hop1 plays a critical role at the leptotene/zygotene transition which is defined by transition from pairing to synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. During this transition, Hop1 is required for maintenance of normal axis structure, formation of SC from telomere to telomere, and development of recombination foci. These <i>hop1Δ</i> mutant defects are DSB dependent and require Sme4/Zip1-mediated progression of the interhomolog interaction program, potentially via a pre-SC role. The same phenotype occurs not only in <i>hop1Δ</i> but also in absence of the cohesin Rec8 and in <i>spo76-1</i>, a non-null mutant of cohesin-associated Spo76/Pds5. Thus, Hop1 and cohesins collaborate at this crucial step of meiotic prophase. In addition, analysis of 4 non-null mutants that lack this transition defect reveals that Hop1 also plays important roles in modulation of axis length, homolog-axis juxtaposition, interlock resolution, and spreading of the crossover interference signal. Finally, unexpected variations in crossover density point to the existence of effects that both enhance and limit crossover formation. Links to previously described roles of the protein in other organisms are discussed.

The fitness effects of new mutations determine key properties of evolutionary processes. Beneficial mutations drive evolution, yet selection is also shaped by the frequency of small-effect deleterious mutations, whose combined effect can burden otherwise adaptive lineages and alter evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in clonally evolving organisms such as viruses, microbes, and tumors. The small effect sizes of these important mutations have made accurate measurements of their rates difficult. In microbes, assessing the effect of mutations on growth can be especially instructive, as this complex phenotype is closely linked to fitness in clonally evolving organisms. Here, we perform high-throughput time-lapse microscopy on cells from mutation-accumulation strains to precisely infer the distribution of mutational effects on growth rate in the budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We show that mutational effects on growth rate are overwhelmingly negative, highly skewed towards very small effect sizes, and frequent enough to suggest that deleterious hitchhikers may impose a significant burden on evolving lineages. By using lines that accumulated mutations in either wild-type or slippage repair-defective backgrounds, we further disentangle the effects of 2 common types of mutations, single-nucleotide substitutions and simple sequence repeat indels, and show that they have distinct effects on yeast growth rate. Although the average effect of a simple sequence repeat mutation is very small (approximately 0.3%), many do alter growth rate, implying that this class of frequent mutations has an important evolutionary impact.

                <p>by Noga Preminger, Maya Schuldiner</p>

Mitochondrial shape and network formation have been primarily associated with the well-established processes of fission and fusion. However, recent research has unveiled an intricate and multifaceted landscape of mitochondrial morphology that extends far beyond the conventional fission–fusion paradigm. These less-explored dimensions harbor numerous unresolved mysteries. This review navigates through diverse processes influencing mitochondrial shape and network formation, highlighting the intriguing complexities and gaps in our understanding of mitochondrial architecture. The exploration encompasses various scales, from biophysical principles governing membrane dynamics to molecular machineries shaping mitochondria, presenting a roadmap for future research in this evolving field.

                Background The relationship dynamics between postdoctoral researchers and their managers – typically Principal Investigators (PIs) - can directly and indirectly impact the professional development activities that postdocs participate in. Although career and development (C&D) conversations can be a platform through which both parties communicate about the postdoc’s development needs and career aspirations, it is unclear how frequently postdocs are having these types of conversations. Evidence from across the UK indicates that this group receive little feedback on their performance. Methods To explore interventions that could empower postdocs to initiate C&D conversations, we conducted a pilot study at the University of Cambridge where current postdocs were offered workshops utilizing two widely available professional development tools. Both workshops included 360-degree feedback interventions, and we hypothesized that the feedback gathered through these tools could give postdocs both a launching pad for facilitating a conversation with their PI and address the aforementioned feedback shortfall. Results Although most of the participant sample reported already having C&D conversations, those who did not report as such demonstrated mixed feelings about whether facilitating these types of discussions is even part of the PI role. Insights from participants’ engagement with the 360-degree feedback tools also show that participants were mindful of time constraints when seeking feedback, indicating that the usefulness of such interventions may be inhibited by wider cultural issues in the sector. Conclusions Through the development of what we call ‘the researcher development framework, this study highlights the shortcomings of using professional development interventions to address cultural issues.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27015?af=R">Lesions Causing Alice in Wonderland Syndrome Map to a Common Brain Network Linking Body and Size Perception</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) profoundly affects human perception of size and scale, particularly regarding one's own body and the environment. Its neuroanatomical basis has remained elusive, partly because brain lesions causing AIWS can occur in different brain regions. Here, we aimed to determine if brain lesions causing AIWS map to a distributed brain network.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective case–control study analyzing 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS identified through systematic literature review was conducted. Using resting-state functional connectome data from 1,000 healthy individuals, the whole-brain connections of each lesion were estimated and contrasted with those from a control dataset comprising 1,073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Additionally, connectivity findings from lesion-induced AIWS cases were compared with functional neuroimaging results from 5 non-lesional AIWS cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AIWS-associated lesions were located in various brain regions with minimal overlap (≤33%). However, the majority of lesions (≥85%) demonstrated shared connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, known to be selectively activated by viewing body part images, and the inferior parietal cortex, involved in size and scale judgements. This pattern was uniquely characteristic of AIWS when compared with other neuropsychiatric disorders (family-wise error-corrected <i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) and consistent with functional neuroimaging observations in AIWS due to nonlesional causes (median correlation <i>r =</i> 0.56, interquartile range 0.24).</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1585/v2?src=rss">The moderating effect of entrepreneurial motivation on the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and behaviour: An extension of the theory of planned behaviour on emerging economy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The study investigates the influence of antecedents of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and personality traits on entrepreneurial intention and behaviour among engineering students in an emerging economy. It employs the extension of the TPB model by focusing on the intention-behaviour gap, an under-researched area in research. Furthermore, it investigates the moderating effect of entrepreneurial motivation on the relationship between intention and behaviour to improve conceptual model predictability. Methods A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 1,564 engineering students, and the data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) with Amos software. Results The results revealed that subjective norms were the strongest predictor of entrepreneurial intention and behaviour, followed by entrepreneurial alertness, perceived behavioural control, attitude towards entrepreneurship, need for achievement, and risk tolerance. Moreover, the moderation analysis showed that entrepreneurial motivation was crucial in moderating the relationship between intention and behaviour. Conclusions The present conceptual model contributes to the existing TPB model by improving predictive power to understand the intention-behaviour relationship. The results of the study will assist policymakers, academicians of higher education institutions, and universities in developing policies, strategies, and curricula to engage more students in entrepreneurial activities.

                Inhibitory interneurons are thought to exhibit stereotyped patterns of activity. By imaging large populations of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons simultaneously at kilohertz speed, Huang et al. reveal dynamic and flexible “cell assemblies” formed by PV cells. These assemblies may support a much richer pattern of postsynaptic inhibition than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93871">Heparan sulfate-dependent phase separation of CCL5 and its chemotactic activity</a></h4>

              
                Secreted chemokines form concentration gradients in target tissues to control migratory directions and patterns of immune cells in response to inflammatory stimulation; however, how the gradients are formed is much debated. Heparan sulfate (HS) binds to chemokines and modulates their activities. In this study, we investigated the roles of HS in the gradient formation and chemoattractant activity of CCL5 that is known to bind to HS. CCL5 and heparin underwent liquid–liquid phase separation and formed gradient, which was confirmed using CCL5 immobilized on heparin-beads. The biological implication of HS in CCL5 gradient formation was established in CHO-K1 (wild-type) and CHO-677 (lacking HS) cells by Transwell assay. The effect of HS on CCL5 chemoattractant activity was further proved by Transwell assay of human peripheral blood cells. Finally, peritoneal injection of the chemokines into mice showed reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells either by mutant CCL5 (lacking heparin-binding sequence) or by addition of heparin to wild-type CCL5. Our experimental data propose that co-phase separation of CCL5 with HS establishes a specific chemokine concentration gradient to trigger directional cell migration. The results warrant further investigation on other heparin-binding chemokines and allows for a more elaborate insight into disease process and new treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92457">Human disturbance increases spatiotemporal associations among mountain forest terrestrial mammal species</a></h4>

              
                Spatial and temporal associations between sympatric species underpin biotic interactions, structure ecological assemblages, and sustain ecosystem functioning and stability. However, the resilience of interspecific spatiotemporal associations to human activity remains poorly understood, particularly in mountain forests where anthropogenic impacts are often pervasive. Here, we applied context-dependent Joint Species Distribution Models to a systematic camera-trap survey dataset from a global biodiversity hotspot in eastern Himalayas to understand how prominent human activities in mountain forests influence species associations within terrestrial mammal communities. We obtained 10,388 independent detections of 17 focal species (12 carnivores and five ungulates) from 322 stations over 43,163 camera days of effort. We identified a higher incidence of positive associations in habitats with higher levels of human modification (87%) and human presence (83%) compared to those located in habitats with lower human modification (64%) and human presence (65%) levels. We also detected a significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance, corresponding to more frequent encounters between pairs of species. Our findings indicate that human activities can push mammals together into more frequent encounters and associations, which likely influences the coexistence and persistence of wildlife, with potential far-ranging ecological consequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94583">Editing of endogenous tubulins reveals varying effects of tubulin posttranslational modifications on axonal growth and regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) modulate the dynamic properties of microtubules and their interactions with other proteins. However, the effects of tubulin PTMs were often revealed indirectly through the deletion of modifying enzymes or the overexpression of tubulin mutants. In this study, we directly edited the endogenous tubulin loci to install PTM-mimicking or -disabling mutations and studied their effects on microtubule stability, neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, cargo transport, and sensory functions in the touch receptor neurons of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We found that the status of β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation and K252 acetylation strongly affected microtubule dynamics, neurite growth, and regeneration, whereas α-tubulin K40 acetylation had little influence. Polyglutamylation and detyrosination in the tubulin C-terminal tail had more subtle effects on microtubule stability likely by modulating the interaction with kinesin-13. Overall, our study systematically assessed and compared several tubulin PTMs for their impacts on neuronal differentiation and regeneration and established an in vivo platform to test the function of tubulin PTMs in neurons.

	<p>This prospective crossover study aimed to investigate the effect of binaural beat therapy music on soccer player performance. Between July 2023 and December 2023, 45 athletes (31 females/14 males, mean age = 20.47 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99) wore Bluetooth earphones through which one of the following was given during initial 20 min warm-up exercises before undergoing repeated sprint ability tests: no music/fast-tempo music/fast-tempo music with background binaural beat therapy music. Heart rate change after warm-up exercises/repeated sprint ability (RSA) tests and the time to finish RSA tests were recorded. Despite no significant difference in heart rate increase after warm-up between the two genders regardless of intervention, larger increases after RSA tests were found in males following any of the three interventions (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) with the most notable difference observed after fast-tempo music (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). A significant effect size (r = 0.2) correlated with fast-tempo music during warm-up in either gender. Binaural beat therapy music during warm-up reached a significant effect size only when all participants were considered, suggesting limited benefits.</p>

The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days (MMD) for HFEM or monthly headache days (MHD) for CM at weeks 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 compared to baseline. The secondary endpoints included changes in monthly analgesic intake (MAI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS-4), and responder rates. The safety analysis involved 44 subjects; the effectiveness analysis included 26 individuals. Eptinezumab was well-tolerated. In CM patients, eptinezumab significantly reduced MHD (&amp;amp;minus;16.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.9, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), MAI, NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4. In HFEM patients, it significantly reduced NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4, though reductions in MMD (&amp;amp;minus;3.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.5) and MAI were not statistically significant. Overall, &amp;amp;ge;50% and &amp;amp;ge;75% response rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively (60% and 30% in non-responders to subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs). The clinical change was rated as much or very much improved by 61.0% of the patients. Eptinezumab demonstrated high effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in real-life among hard-to-treat migraine patients with multiple treatment failures, including anti-CGRP mAbs.</p>

	<p>The exploration of functional resting-state brain developmental parameters and measures can help to improve scientific, psychological, and medical applications. The present work focussed on both traditional approaches, such as topographical power analyses at the signal space level, and advanced approaches, such as the exploration of age-related dynamics of source space data. The results confirmed the expectation that the third life decade would show a kind of stability in oscillatory signal and source-space-related parameters. However, from a source dynamics perspective, different frequency ranges appear to develop quite differently, as reflected in age-related sequential network communication profiles. Among other discoveries, the left anterior cingulate source location could be shown to reduce bi-directional network communication in the lower alpha band, whereas it differentiated its uni- and bidirectional communication dynamics to sub-cortical and posterior brain locations. Higher alpha oscillations enhanced communication dynamics between the thalamus and particularly frontal areas. In conclusion, resting-state data appear to be, at least in part, functionally reorganized in the default mode network, while quantitative measures, such as topographical power and regional source activity, did not correlate with age in the third life decade. In line with other authors, we suggest the further development of a multi-perspective approach in biosignal analyses.</p>

<p>Lognormal-like skewed spine size distribution is maintained in tumor necrosis factor deficiency and receptor loss. Dendritic spines sizes are distributed lognormally with a high percentage of the population consisting of small spines and a small percentage of the population consisting of large spines. The logarithm of the data shows a normal distribution. In mice exhibiting TNF deficiency, the lognormal distribution is maintained, albeit with a differences in its width, with the TNF deficient mice having more small and large sized spines and less medium sized spines. This finding was also observed in mice lacking TNF-receptor 1 and partially in mice lacking TNF-receptor 2. In mice lacking both TNF-receptor 1 and receptor 2 the lognormal distribution of spine head sizes was maintained, however, the distribution was shifted to the left, indicating a globalised reduction in spine head sizes of all spines. Spines maintain a lognormal distribution in multiple different conditions including homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity, blockage of presynaptic transmitter release and genetic disruption of TNF or its receptors, strenghtening the concept of redistribution of spine head sizes as a crucial functional adaptation within the neuron.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dendritic spines are sites of synaptic plasticity and their head size correlates with the strength of the corresponding synapse. We recently showed that the distribution of spine head sizes follows a lognormal-like distribution even after blockage of activity or plasticity induction. As the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) influences synaptic transmission and constitutive TNF and receptor (TNF-R)-deficiencies cause changes in spine head size distributions, we tested whether these genetic alterations disrupt the lognormality of spine head sizes. Furthermore, we distinguished between spines containing the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP-positive), which is present in large, strong and stable spines and those lacking it (SP-negative). Our analysis revealed that neither TNF-deficiency nor the absence of TNF-R1, TNF-R2 or TNF-R 1 and 2 (TNF-R1/R2) degrades the general lognormal-like, skewed distribution of spine head sizes (all spines, SP-positive spines, SP-negative spines). However, TNF, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2-deficiency affected the width of the lognormal distribution, and TNF-R1/2-deficiency shifted the distribution to the left. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the lognormal-like, skewed distribution, which is maintained even in the face of genetic manipulations that alter the distribution of spine head sizes. Our observations are in line with homeostatic adaptation mechanisms of neurons regulating the distribution of spines and their head sizes.</p>

                The brain’s choroid plexus (CP), which operates as an anatomical and functional ‘checkpoint’, regulates the communication between brain and periphery and contributes to the maintenance of healthy brain homeostasis throughout life. Evidence from mouse models and humans reveals a link between loss of CP checkpoint properties and dysregulation of the CP immune milieu as a conserved feature across diverse neurological conditions. In particular, we suggest that an imbalance between different immune signals at the CP, including CD4+ T cell-derived cytokines, type-I interferon, and complement components, can perpetuate brain inflammation and cognitive deterioration in aging and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we highlight the role of CP metabolism in controlling CP inflammation, and propose that targeting molecules that regulate CP metabolism could be effective in safeguarding brain function.

	<p>Dysautonomic disorders are an increasingly studied group of conditions, either as isolated diseases or associated with other neurological disorders. There is growing interest in understanding how dysautonomia affects people with epilepsy, who may report autonomic symptoms before, during and after seizures. Furthermore, autonomic abnormalities appear to play a role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, likely contributing to the increased mortality rate described in epilepsy. To better understand the association between epilepsy and dysautonomia, we explored electrochemical skin conductance in a group of 18 children and young adults with epilepsy compared to 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by the SudoscanTM test. We found a significant difference in terms of electrochemical skin conductance, suggesting that people with epilepsy suffer significantly reduced conductance in small nerve fibers. Within patients, values were significantly different according to the type of epilepsy and to neuroimaging results, with lower conductance values in epilepsies of unknown origin and in patients with morphological abnormalities of the brain. Using a non-invasive test, we identified altered conductance of small sympathetic nerve fibers in children and young adults with epilepsy, suggesting underlying dysautonomia. Further studies are needed to investigate this association and to clarify its neurobiological substrates.</p>

	<p>Deficits in memory performance have been linked to a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. While many studies have assessed the memory impacts of individual conditions, this study considers a broader perspective by evaluating how memory recall is differentially associated with nine common neuropsychiatric conditions using data drawn from 55 international studies, aggregating 15,883 unique participants aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;90. The effects of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder on immediate, short-, and long-delay verbal learning and memory (VLM) scores were estimated relative to matched healthy individuals. Random forest models identified age, years of education, and site as important VLM covariates. A Bayesian harmonization approach was used to isolate and remove site effects. Regression estimated the adjusted association of each clinical group with VLM scores. Memory deficits were strongly associated with dementia and schizophrenia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while neither depression nor ADHD showed consistent associations with VLM scores (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Differences associated with clinical conditions were larger for longer delayed recall duration items. By comparing VLM across clinical conditions, this study provides a foundation for enhanced diagnostic precision and offers new insights into disease management of comorbid disorders.</p>

	<p>Gi-coupled receptors, particularly cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), are considered perspective targets for treating brain pathologies, including epilepsy. However, the precise mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of the CBR agonists remains unknown. We have found that WIN 55,212-2 (a CBR agonist) suppresses the synchronous oscillations of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions (epileptiform activity) induced in the neurons of rat hippocampal neuron-glial cultures by bicuculline or NH4Cl. As we have demonstrated, the WIN 55,212-2 effect is mediated by CB1R receptors. The agonist suppresses Ca2+ inflow mediated by the voltage-gated calcium channels but does not alter the inflow mediated by NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. We have also found that phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), and G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK channels) are involved in the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of CB1R activation against epileptiform activity. Thus, our results demonstrate that the antiepileptic action of CB1R agonists is mediated by different intracellular signaling cascades, including non-canonical PLC/PKC-associated pathways.</p>

	<p>Delayed therapy escape (DTE) is frequent after thalamic deep brain stimulation for essential tremor, leading to reduced quality of life, often with ataxic symptoms, and early recognition is challenging. Our goal was to examine whether a low-frequency rebound tremor of the left hand after switching off stimulation is useful as a diagnostic marker for DTE. In this cross-sectional study with additional retrospective analysis, we examined 31 patients with bilateral thalamic DBS &amp;amp;ge; 12 months for essential tremor, using quantitative assessments including video-based motion capture, Fahn&amp;amp;ndash;Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). If available, preoperative (preOP) and 12-month postoperative assessments were included in the analysis. Evaluations occurred with DBS activated (ON) and deactivated (OFF). A higher ratio FTMTRS nowON/preOP indicated DTE. Preoperative FTMTRS scores were available for 16 patients, including 5 patients with DTE. The receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.86 (p = 0.024) for identification of DTE by low-frequency rebound tremor (i.e., OFF) on the left. In conclusion, it could serve as a potential diagnostic marker.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Clinical dynamic posturography concentrates on the pitch and roll but not on the yaw plane instability measures. This emphasis may not represent the axis instability observed in clinical stance and gait tasks for patients with balance deficits in comparison to healthy control (HC) subjects, nor the expected instability based on correlations with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) deficits. To examine the axis stability changes with vestibular loss, we measured trunk sway in all three directions (pitch, roll, and yaw) during the stance and gait tasks of patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis (aUVN) and compared the results with those of HC. Concurrent changes in VORs were also examined and correlated with trunk balance deficits. METHODS: The results of 11 patients (mean age of 61 years) recorded within 6 days of aUVN onset were compared within those of 8 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). All subjects performed a two-legged stance task&amp;amp;mdash;standing with eyes closed on foam (s2ecf), a semi-gait task&amp;amp;mdash;walking eight tandem steps (tan8), and four gait tasks&amp;amp;mdash;walking 3 m with head rotating laterally, pitching, or eyes closed (w3hr, w3hp, w3ec), and walking over four barriers 24 cm high, spaced 1 m apart (barr). The tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; peak-to-peak yaw, pitch and roll angles, and angular velocities were measured with a gyroscope system (SwayStarTM) mounted at L1-3 and combined into three, axis-specific, balance control indexes (BCI), using angles (a) for the tandem gait and barriers task, and angular velocities (v) for all other tasks, as follows: axis BCI = (2 &amp;amp;times; 2ecf)v + 1.5 &amp;amp;times; (w3hr + w3hp + w3ec)v + (tan8 + 12 &amp;amp;times; barr)a. RESULTS: Yaw and pitch BCIs were significantly (p &amp;amp;le; 0.004) greater (88 and 30%, respectively) than roll BCIs for aUVN patients. For HCs, only yaw but not pitch BCIs were greater (p = 0.002) than those of roll (72%). The order of BCI aUVN vs. HC differences was pitch, yaw, and roll at 55, 44, and 31%, respectively (p &amp;amp;le; 0.002). This difference with respect to roll corresponded to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN based on VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses did not correspond with the pitch plane instability observed in the balance control tests. The increases in pitch plane instability in UVL subjects were, however, highly correlated with those of roll and yaw. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that greater yaw than pitch and roll trunk motion during clinical balance tasks is common for aUVN patients and HCs. However, aUVN leads to a larger increase in pitch than yaw plane instability and a smaller increase in roll plane instability. This difference with respect to roll corresponds to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN observed in VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses does not correspond with the enhanced movements in the pitch plane, observed in balance control tasks. Whether asymmetries in vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (Vemps) are better correlated with the deficits in pitch plane balance control remains to be investigated. The current results provide a strong rationale for the clinical testing of directional specific balance responses, especially yaw and pitch, and the linking of balance results for yaw and roll to VOR asymmetries.</p>

	<p>Chemsex is the interplay of substance use by men who have sex with men (MSM) in sexual contexts. The minority stress model and the identity process theory are explanatory models. In this study, we investigated whether (i) differences in certain psychosocial aspects (i.e., shame, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts) exist between chemsex users and non-users, and (ii) which factors influence an awareness of negative impacts in chemsex users. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey, including sociodemography, sexual history, history of substance use, validated scales for shame-proneness, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts. Our analysis comprised descriptive statistics, t-tests, Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations, and a multiple linear regression model. We recorded a total of 3257 datasets with 107 chemsex users. Chemsex users showed higher rates for risky sexual behavior. Values for shame proneness, more negative aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts were elevated in chemsex users with an awareness of negative impacts. Sexual anxiety, intravenous substance use, and having had a difficult process coming out were significant predictors of feeling negative impacts. Aspects of shame, queer identity aspects, and sexual self-concepts play an important role in the field of chemsex. Different explanatory models seem to be relevant for different subgroups of chemsex users. Chemsex users with an awareness of a problem were particularly vulnerable and distressed but had the highest motivation for change. Prevention, counseling, and care might profit from the inclusion of these aspects. Further anti-stigma campaigns and a specialization of the healthcare system are needed.

	<p>Anomia, characterized by difficulty in word retrieval, particularly action verbs, poses a significant challenge in post-stroke aphasia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained attention for language processing investigations and interventions. This systematic review explores the potential of rTMS as a modality to address action-verb deficits in post-stroke aphasia. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco and Web of Science in February 2024 for English articles (1996&amp;amp;ndash;2024). Eligible studies involved post-stroke aphasia action naming rehabilitation with rTMS. In some of these studies, rTMS was combined with speech-language therapy. In total, 10 studies were included in this systematic review. These articles highlight the potential of rTMS in improving verb retrieval deficits. While significant improvements may not be evident, notable progress both before and after intervention is observed in this review. However, it also underscores the need for further research to enhance language recovery for individuals with post-stroke aphasia.</p>

	<p>Increasing evidence shows that virtual reality (VR) training is highly effective in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Another modern form of training is cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor dual-task training (CMDT), which has been demonstrated to rapidly improve physical and cognitive functions in real environments. This study aims to test whether a VR-based CMDT protocol can be used for motor and cognitive skill enhancement in young, healthy subjects. For this aim, 24 university students participated in a randomized control trial. The experimental group participated in a 5-week virtual reality reaction training (VRRT), performing 30 min sessions once a week. The control group did not receive any training but was tested twice with the same measures and temporal distance as the experimental group. Before and after the intervention, motor, cognitive, and electrophysiological measures were assessed. The results showed that following VRRT, the response time for both physical and cognitive tests was improved by about 14% and 12%, respectively, while the control group did not show significant changes. Moreover, electrophysiological data revealed a significant increase in anticipatory motor readiness in premotor brain areas in the experimental group only; however, cognitive top&amp;amp;ndash;down control tended to be increased in prefrontal areas after VRRT. This training protocol in a VR modality seems to be as effective as other CMDT methodologies carried out in a real modality. Still, it has the advantages of being more flexible and more user-friendly compared to standard training. The VRRT&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy on physical and cognitive functions indicates that virtual reality applications can be used by the young population, not only for entertainment purposes but also in the form of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor training.</p>

	<p>A body of experimental research has aimed to investigate processes underlying dream formation by examining the effects of a range of pre-sleep stimuli and events on subsequent dream content. Given its ever-growing presence and salience in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s everyday lives, pre-sleep media consumption stands out as a key variable that could influence people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate the experimental evidence of the effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content. A systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science using terms related to moving visual media and dreams yielded 29 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, we found modest yet varied effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content, with rates of stimulus-related incorporation ranging from 3% to 43% for REM dream reports, 4% to 30% for NREM sleep mentation reports, and between 11% and 35% for home dream reports. Our review highlights the large methodological heterogeneity and gaps across studies, the general difficulty in influencing dream content using pre-sleep exposure to visual media, and suggests promising venues for future research to advance our understanding of how and why digital media may impact people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams.</p>

                Background A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can learn and make predictions by adjusting the strength of the connections between nodes. The sigmoid function is commonly used as an activation function in these nodes. This study explores the potential applicability of biological materials in the development of alternative activation functions. Methods Inspired by the fact that acetylcholine induces intestinal contractions that follow a sigmoid function, we used pharmacological data obtained from guinea pig ilea in a layered neural network for image classification tasks. Results and Conclusions We found that the intestinal data-based neural network with the same structure as a conventional three-layer perceptron achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 85.7% ± 0.6% based on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (chance = 10%). Additionally, the neural network was trained to determine whether objects in photographs collected from the internet were digestible, achieving an accuracy of 88.5% ± 0.9% (chance = 50%). Our approach highlights the potential applicability of intestine data in neural computations based on pharmacological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-301/v2?src=rss">Proposal of a domain model for 3D representation of buildings in Ecuador. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The accelerated urban sprawl of cities around the world presents major challenges for urban planning and land resource management. In this context, it is crucial to have a detailed 3D representation of buildings enriched with accurate alphanumeric information. A distinctive aspect of this proposal is its specific focus on the spatial unit corresponding to buildings. In order to propose a domain model for the 3D representation of buildings, the national standard of Ecuador and the international standard (ISO 19152:2012 LADM) were considered. The proposal includes a detailed specification of attributes, both for the general subclass of buildings and for their infrastructure. The application of the domain model proposal was crucial in a study area located in the Riobamba canton, due to the characteristics of the buildings in that area. For this purpose, a geodatabase was created in pgAdmin4 with official information, taking into account the structure of the proposed model and linking it with geospatial data for an adequate management and 3D representation of the buildings in an open-source Geographic Information System. This application improves cadastral management in the study region and has wider implications. This model is intended to serve as a benchmark for other countries facing similar challenges in cadastral management and 3D representation of buildings, promote efficient urban development and contribute to global sustainable development.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Background In ayurveda, sciatica can be correlated to ‘Grudhrasi’ under Vata Nanatmaja-Vyadhi (neurological disorders caused by Vata, one of the bodily humour). In this mainly bodily humours vata and kapha are vitiating producing symptoms like piercing pain, stiffness, twitching, numbness and pain radiating from lumbosacral region to lower limb up to the foot. Therapeutic plan includes stabilizing and bringing back the vitiated vata and kapha humours to equilibrium. The prevalence of sciatica varies considerably ranging from 3.8% in the working population to 7.9% in the nonworking population. Aim Comparative evaluation of efficacy of Rasonapinda and Trayodashang guggul as an adjuvant to katibasti (oil pooling therapy) in the management of Grudhrasi (Sciatica). Objectives To assess the efficacy of Rasonapinda as an adjuvant to katibasti in subjective and objective parameters of Grudhrasi (Sciatica). To assess the efficacy of Trayodashang guggul as an adjuvant to katibasti in subjective and objective parameters of Grudhrasi (Sciatica). To compare the efficacy of Rasonapinda and Trayodashang guggul as an adjuvant to katibasti in subjective and objective parameters. Standardisation of Rasonapinda (modified formvati). Methods In this study, a total of 60 patients will be enrolled and divided equally into two groups. In group A, Trayodashang Guggul 500 mg twice a day after meal with warm water for 30 days adjuvant with katibasti for the initial 7 days will be given. In group B, Rasonapinda 500 mg twice a day after meal with warm water adjuvant with katibasti for the initial 7 days will be given for 30 days.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002624">The human hypothalamus coordinates switching between different survival actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sarah M. Tashjian, Dean Mobbs</p>

Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-222/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Urethral Diverticulum after Tubularised Incised Plate Repair of Distal Hypospadias: An Uncommon Complication. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A urethral diverticulum can be defined as a pocket that forms from the lining of the urethra and protrudes into the surrounding tissue, a condition which causes voiding dysfunction and may result as a rare complication of hypospadias repair surgery. Case report We report the case of a 2-year-old child who presented to us in 2019 complaining of a thin forceful stream, ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis while voiding, and post-void dribbling. He has a history of undergoing a tubularised incised plate urethroplasty for distal penile hypospadias at 18-months-old. Ultrasound showed increased post-void residual volume and cystourethroscopy confirmed a urethral diverticulum extending from the subcorona to the base of the penis. The patient underwent partial excision of diverticulum, urethroplasty, and meatoplasty. He was followed-up 3 months later with complete resolution of his symptoms and a normal urinary stream with no urethral ballooning or dribbling. Conclusion Urethral diverticulum may present as a complication post hypospadias repair. Although it is rare, we believe that it is important for the patient’s parents to understand the possibility and know of the signs and symptoms in addition to attending regular outpatient clinic appointments in order to facilitate early management if needed. Furthermore, it is highly important for physicians to assess newborns for hypospadias before carrying out circumcision as it is a contraindication for the procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-243/v2?src=rss">Case Series: Pleomorphic adenoma in minor salivary gland [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Pleomorphic adenomas (PA) are the most prevalent benign salivary gland neoplasms. They may occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. They are more commonly observed in females (60%). These tumors can arise in both the major and minor salivary glands. Approximately 80% of these tumors are diagnosed in the parotid gland, whereas 10% arise in the minor salivary glands, mainly affecting the palates, followed by the lips and cheeks. This report describes two cases of unusual lesions that were diagnosed as (PA) in the minor salivary glands in our department via a review of the relevant literature. The first case involved an 83-year-old man who presented with a slow-growing swelling on the right side of the upper lip, and the second case involved a 45-year-old woman who presented with a slow-growing lesion on the palate. The presence of PA was confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. Although relatively rare, PA is a benign lesion, the diagnosis of which must be known for appropriate therapeutic management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1355/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Bell’s palsy: a neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the causative agent of the most recent pandemic that hit the globe and has been the cause of a vast range of symptoms, including neurological symptoms. Bell’s palsy is an acute peripheral facial paralysis commonly associated with viral infections. Case presentation This case report describes a patient with incidental COVID-19 infection that led to acute unilateral peripheral facial paralysis, Bell’s palsy. Our patient is a 35-year-old male with no known comorbidities who was presenting with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and was found to be positive for COVID-19. Soon after the onset of symptoms, he also developed right-sided facial weakness in association with his symptoms. A thorough examination revealed a peripheral neurological lesion. The diagnosis of Bell’s palsy secondary to COVID-19 virus infection was through the exclusion of other possible causes. Conclusions This case report suggests a potential link between Bell’s palsy and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Further research is essential to determine the significance of neuropathies in COVID-19 and enhance treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-711/v1?src=rss">Shared decision-making underutilisation at an outpatient clinic during BMI monitoring in rural Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recall of medical instructions is associated with improved adherence to treatment. The recall of the Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for the improvement of adherence to treatments related to obesity. The burden of obesity all over the world has increased, including in many sub-Saharan African countries. This study measured the recall of BMI, shared decision-making (SDM), and patients’ demographics to determine if they were associated. Methods The study was conducted at a rural hospital outpatient clinic in South Western Uganda. Data were collected using a questionnaire and collaboRate-5 tool for measuring shared decision-making. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. The chi-square test and Pearson coefficient test were done. Results Out of the 92 participants in this study, the median age was 36 years, in an age range of 18 to 87 years, the majority were male 54 (58.7%), most had a background of attending formal education 75 (81.5%), 79 (85.9%) were not able to recall their BMI; 13 (14.1%) were able to recall their BMI. Only gender among demographic factors studied was associated with recall of BMI (p = 0.027). Shared decision-making was associated with the recall of BMI (P < 0.001). Conclusions The proportion of patients who were not able to recall their BMI after the outpatient clinic visit was high. Gender and the use of SDM were associated with recall of BMI. Measured items describing the use of SDM were only reported among 21(22.8%) participants. SDM was underutilized during the study period at the outpatient clinic. There is a need to have continuous medical education on SDM.
