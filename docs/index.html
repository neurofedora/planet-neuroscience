              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endotaxis: A Universal Algorithm for Mapping, Goal-Learning, and Navigation</a></h4>

              
                An animal entering a new environment typically faces three challenges: explore the space for resources, memorize their locations, and navigate towards those targets as needed. Experimental work on exploration, mapping, and navigation has mostly focused on simple environments - such as an open arena, a pond [1], or a desert [2] - and much has been learned about neural signals in diverse brain areas under these conditions [3,4]. However, many natural environments are highly constrained, such as a system of burrows, or of paths through the underbrush. More generally, many cognitive tasks are equally constrained, allowing only a small set of actions at any given stage in the process. Here we propose an algorithm that learns the structure of an arbitrary environment, discovers useful targets during exploration, and navigates back to those targets by the shortest path. It makes use of a behavioral module common to all motile animals, namely the ability to follow an odor to its source [5]. We show how the brain can learn to generate internal "virtual odors'" that guide the animal to any location of interest. This endotaxis algorithm can be implemented with a simple 3-layer neural circuit using only biologically realistic structures and learning rules. Several neural components of this scheme are found in brains from insects to humans. Nature may have evolved a general mechanism for search and navigation on the ancient backbone of chemotaxis.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, studies have highlighted the δ-opioid receptor (DOPr) as a promising therapeutic target for chronic pain management. While exhibiting milder undesired effects than most currently prescribed opioids, its specific agonists elicit effective analgesic responses in numerous animal models of chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic, diabetic, and cancer-related pain. However, as compared with the extensively studied μ-opioid receptor, the molecular mechanisms governing its trafficking remain elusive. Recent advances have denoted several significant particularities in the regulation of DOPr intracellular routing, setting it apart from the other members of the opioid receptor family. Although they share high homology, each opioid receptor subtype displays specific amino acid patterns potentially involved in the regulation of its trafficking. These precise motifs or “barcodes” are selectively recognized by regulatory proteins and therefore dictate several aspects of the itinerary of a receptor, including its anterograde transport, internalization, recycling, and degradation. With a specific focus on the regulation of DOPr trafficking, this review will discuss previously reported, as well as potential novel trafficking barcodes within the opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ opioid peptide receptors, and their impact in determining distinct interactomes and physiological responses.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive markers in mice have been identified in two distinct peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and distributed in different laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Recently, however, a study in humans showed a significant overlapping in these two populations. In this study, we investigated the distribution of various nociceptive markers in the lumbar DRG and spinal cord of the dromedary camel. Immunohistochemical data showed a remarkable percentage of total neurons in the DRG expressed IB4 binding (54.5%), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 49.5%), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1; 48.2%), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS; 30.6%). The co-localization data showed that 89.6% and 74.0% of CGRP- and TRPV1-labeled neurons, respectively, were IB4 positive. In addition, 61.6% and 84.2% of TRPV1- and NOS-immunoreactive neurons, respectively, were also co-localized with CGRP. The distribution of IB4, CGRP, TRPV1, substance P, and NOS immunoreactivities in the spinal cord were observed in lamina I and outer lamina II (IIo). Quantitative data showed that 82.4% of IB4-positive nerve terminals in laminae I and IIo were co-localized with CGRP, and 86.0% of CGRP-labeled terminals were co-localized with IB4. Similarly, 85.1% of NOS-labeled nerve terminals were co-localized with CGRP. No neuropeptide Y (NPY) or cholecystokinin (CCK) immunoreactivities were detected in the DRG, and no co-localization between IB4, NPY, and CCK were observed in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate marked convergence of nociceptive markers in the primary afferent neurons in camels, which is similar to humans rather than the mouse. The data also emphasizes the importance of interspecies differences when selecting ideal animal models for studying nociception and treating chronic pain.</p>

     alt="Differential investment in visual and olfactory brain regions is linked to the sensory needs of a wasp social parasite and its host"/>
<p>Brain reconstructions reveal differential investment in sensory brain regions between the obligate social parasite <i>Polistes sulcifer</i> and its host, <i>P. dominula</i>. Social parasites have larger optic lobes (blue), which reflects their visual needs to navigate long distances and locate a host nest. Contrastingly, hosts show large antennal lobes (yellow) and calyces of the mushroom bodies (red), coinciding with the olfactory and sensory processing needs of maintaining colony cohesion, including recognizing conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Scale = 1 mm.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obligate insect social parasites evolve traits to effectively locate and then exploit their hosts, whereas hosts have complex social behavioral repertoires, which include sensory recognition to reject potential conspecific intruders and heterospecific parasites. While social parasites and host behaviors have been studied extensively, less is known about how their sensory systems function to meet their specific selective pressures. Here, we compare investment in visual and olfactory brain regions in the paper wasp <i>Polistes dominula</i>, and its obligate social parasite <i>P. sulcifer</i>, to explore the links among sensory systems,brain and behavior. Our results show significant relative volumetric differences between these two closely related species, consistent with their very different life histories. Social parasites show proportionally larger optic lobes and central complex to likely navigate long-distance migrations and unfamiliar landscapes to locate the specific species of hosts they usurp. Contrastingly, hosts have larger antennal lobes and calyces of the mushroom bodies compared with social parasites, as predicted by their sensory means to maintain social cohesion via olfactory signals, allocate colony tasks, forage, and recognize conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Our work suggests how this tradeoff between visual and olfactory brain regions may facilitate different sensory adaptations needed to perform social and foraging tasks by the host, including recognition of parasites, or to fly long distances and successful host localizing by the social parasite.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">{mu}-Opioid Receptor Stimulation in the Nucleus Accumbens Increases Vocal-Social Interactions in Flocking European Starlings, Sturnus Vulgaris</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social connections in gregarious species are vital for safety and survival. For these reasons, many bird species form large flocks outside the breeding season. It has been proposed that such large social groups may be maintained via reward induced by positive interactions with conspecifics and via the reduction of a negative affective state caused by social separation. Moreover, within a flock optimal social spacing between conspecifics is important, indicating that individuals may optimize spacing to be close but not too close to conspecifics. The &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are well known for their role in both reward and the reduction of negative affective states, suggesting that MOR stimulation in NAc may play a critical role in flock cohesion. To begin to test this hypothesis, social and nonsocial behaviors were examined in male and female European starlings (<I>Sturnus vulgaris</I>) in nonbreeding flocks after intra-NAc infusion of saline and three doses of the selective MOR agonist <scp>d</scp>-Ala<sup>2</sup>-<I>N</I>-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>-Glycol<sup>5</sup>-enkephalin (DAMGO). DAMGO in NAc dose-dependently increased singing behavior and facilitated social approaches while at the same time promoting displacements potentially used to maintain social spacing. These findings support the hypothesis that MORs in NAc promote social interactions important for group cohesion in nonsexual contexts and suggest the possibility that MORs in the NAc play a role in optimizing the pull of joining a flock with the push of potential agonistic encounters.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Information theoretic metrics have proven useful in quantifying the relationship between behaviorally relevant parameters and neuronal activity with relatively few assumptions. However, these metrics are typically applied to action potential (AP) recordings and were not designed for the slow timescales and variable amplitudes typical of functional fluorescence recordings (e.g., calcium imaging). The lack of research guidelines on how to apply and interpret these metrics with fluorescence traces means the neuroscience community has yet to realize the power of information theoretic metrics. Here, we used computational methods to create mock AP traces with known amounts of information. From these, we generated fluorescence traces and examined the ability of different information metrics to recover the known information values. We provide guidelines for how to use information metrics when applying them to functional fluorescence and demonstrate their appropriate application to GCaMP6f population recordings from mouse hippocampal neurons imaged during virtual navigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Mammalian Olfactory Bulb Contributes to the Adaptation of Odor Responses: A Second Perceptual Computation Carried Out by the Bulb</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>While humans and other mammals exhibit adaptation to odorants, the neural mechanisms and brain locations involved in this process are incompletely understood. One possibility is that it primarily occurs as a result of the interactions between odorants and odorant receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. In this scenario, adaptation would arise as a peripheral phenomenon transmitted to the brain. An alternative possibility is that adaptation occurs because of processing in the brain. We made an initial test of these possibilities using a two-color imaging strategy to simultaneously measure the activity of the olfactory receptor nerve terminals (input to the bulb) and mitral/tufted cell apical dendrites (output from the bulb) in anesthetized and awake mice. Repeated odor stimulation at the same concentration resulted in a decline in the bulb output, while the input remained relatively stable. Thus, the mammalian olfactory bulb appears to participate in generating the perception of olfactory adaptation under this stimulus condition. Similar experiments conducted previously showed that the bulb may also participate in the perception of concentration invariance of odorant recognition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B80">Storace and Cohen, 2017</cross-ref>); thus, the bulb is simultaneously carrying out more than one computation, as is true of other mammalian brain regions and perhaps is the case for all animals with sophisticated nervous systems. However, in contrast with other sensory systems (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B85">Van Essen et al., 1992</cross-ref>), the very first processing stage in the olfactory system has an output that may directly represent perceptions.</p>

                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

                Background: Screening for albuminuria is generally recommended among patients with hypertension. While the urine dipstick is commonly used for screening urine albumin, there is little evidence about its diagnostic accuracy among these patients in Thailand. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a dipstick in Thai hypertensive patients for detecting albuminuria. Methods: This study collected the data of 3,067 hypertensive patients, with the results of urine dipstick and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) from random single spot urine being examined in the same day at least once, at Lampang Hospital, Thailand, during 2018. For ACR, a reference standard of ≥ 30 mg/g was applied to indicate the presence of albuminuria. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of the trace result from dipsticks were 53.6%, 94.5%, 86.5%, and 75.5%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the dipstick was 0.748. Conclusion: Using the dipstick for screening albuminuria among hypertensive patients should not be recommended for mass screening due to its low sensitivity. In response to high PPV, a trace threshold of the dipstick may be used to indicate presence of albuminuria.

                Background: Vaccination is an effective and alternative means of disease prevention, however, it cannot be conducted on the offspring of fish.  For this process to take place, the transfer of maternal immunity must be implemented. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of transferring immunity from the broodstock to the offspring using a polyvalent vaccine against Aeromonas hydrophila, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas fluorescens in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Methods: Nile tilapia broodstock, with an average weight of 203g (±SD 23 g) was injected with a vaccine used as a treatment. Example include A. hydrophila monovalent (MA), S. agalactiae monovalent (MS), P. fluorescens monovalent (MP), A. hydrophila and S. agalactiae bivalent (BAS), A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens bivalent (BAP), P. fluorescens and S. agalactiae bivalent (BPS), and A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens polyvalent vaccines (PAPS). While the control was fish that were injected with a PBS solution. The broodstock’s immune response was observed on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day, while the immune response and challenge test on the offspring was conducted on the 10th, 20th, 30th, and 40th day during the post-hatching period. Result: The application of PAPS in broodstock could significantly induce the best immune response and immunity to multiple diseases compared to other treatments. The RPS of the PAPS was also higher than the other types of vaccines. This showed that the transfer of immunity from the broodstock to the Nile tilapia offspring could protect it against bacterial diseases such as A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens. Conclusion: The application of PAPS A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, P. fluorescens vaccines increased the broodstock’s immune response and it was transferred to their offsprings. They were able to produce tilapia seeds that are immune to diseases caused by A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens.

                Background: Hypertension, as the comorbidity accompanying COVID-19, is related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE-2R) and endothelial dysregulation which have an important role in blood pressure regulation. Other anti-hypertensive agents are believed to trigger the hyperinflammation process. We aimed to figure out the association between the use of anti-hypertensive drugs and the disease progression of COVID-19 patients.   Methods: This study is an observational cohort study among COVID-19 adult patients from moderate to critically ill admitted to Universitas Airlangga Hospital (UAH) Surabaya with history of hypertension and receiving anti-hypertensive drugs.   Results: Patients receiving beta blockers only had a longer length of stay than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) or calcium channel blockers alone (17, 13.36, and 13.73 respectively), had the higher rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission than ACEi/ARB (p 0.04), and had the highest mortality rate (54.55%). There were no significant differences in length of stay, ICU admission, mortality rate, and days of death among the single, double, and triple anti-hypertensive groups. The mortality rate in groups taking ACEi/ARB was lower than other combination.   Conclusions: Hypertension can increase the severity of COVID-19. The use of ACEI/ARBs in ACE-2 receptor regulation which is thought to aggravate the condition of COVID-19 patients has not yet been proven. This is consistent with findings in other anti-hypertensive groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of non-pharmacologic strategies on prevention or management of intensive care unit delirium: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-operative delirium is a common complication among adult patients in the intensive care unit. Current literature does not support the use of pharmacologic measures to manage this condition, and several studies explore the potential for the use of non-pharmacologic methods such as early mobility plans or environmental modifications. The aim of this systematic review is to examine and report on recently available literature evaluating the relationship between non-pharmacologic management strategies and the reduction of delirium in the intensive care unit. Methods: Six major research databases were systematically searched for articles analyzing the efficacy of non-pharmacologic delirium interventions in the past five years. Search results were restricted to adult human patients aged 18 years or older in the intensive care unit setting, excluding terminally ill subjects and withdrawal-related delirium. Following title, abstract, and full text review, 27 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Results: The 27 reviewed articles consist of 12 interventions with a single-component investigational approach, and 15 with multi-component bundled protocols. Delirium incidence was the most commonly assessed outcome followed by duration. Family visitation was the most effective individual intervention while mobility interventions were the least effective. Two of the three family studies significantly reduced delirium incidence, while one in five mobility studies did the same. Multi-component bundle approaches were the most effective of all; of the reviewed studies, eight of 11 bundles significantly improved delirium incidence and seven of eight bundles decreased the duration of delirium. Conclusions: Multi-component, bundled interventions were more effective at managing intensive care unit delirium than those utilizing an approach with a single interventional element. Although better management of this condition suggests a decrease in resource burden and improvement in patient outcomes, comparative research should be performed to identify the importance of specific bundle elements.

     alt="Expression and distribution of synaptotagmin family members in the zebrafish retina"/>
<p>Zebrafish (<i>D. rerio</i>) synaptotagmins are well conserved and can be grouped in the same classes as mammalian synaptotagmins and show notable distributions in the retina. Zebrafish therefore represent a valuable tool to address the diverse roles of synaptotagmins in retinal physiology.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptotagmins belong to a large family of proteins. Although various synaptotagmins have been implicated as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for vesicle replenishment and release at conventional synapses, their roles at retinal ribbon synapses remain incompletely understood. Zebrafish is a widely used experimental model for retinal research. We therefore investigated the homology between human, rat, mouse, and zebrafish synaptotagmins 1–10 using a bioinformatics approach. We also characterized the expression and distribution of various synaptotagmin (<i>syt</i>) genes in the zebrafish retina using RT-PCR, qPCR, and in situhybridization, focusing on the family members whose products likely underlie Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis in the central nervous system (synaptotagmins 1, 2, 5, and 7). Most zebrafish synaptotagmins are well conserved and can be grouped in the same classes as mammalian synaptotagmins, based on crucial amino acid residues needed for coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and determining phospholipid binding affinity. The only exception is synaptotagmin 1b, which lacks 34 amino acid residues in the C2B domain and is therefore unlikely to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> there. Additionally, the products of zebrafish <i>syt5a</i> and <i>syt5b</i> genes share identity with mammalian class 1 and 5 synaptotagmins. Zebrafish <i>syt1</i>, <i>syt2</i>, <i>syt5</i>, and <i>syt7</i> paralogues are found in the zebrafish brain, eye, and retina, excepting <i>syt1b</i>, which is only present in the brain. The complementary expression pattern of the remaining paralogues in the retina suggests that <i>syt1a</i> and <i>syt5a</i> may underlie synchronous release and <i>syt7a</i> and <i>syt7b</i> may mediate asynchronous release or other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes in different retinal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A grammatico-pragmatic analysis of the because X construction: Private expression within public expression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article investigates an innovative use of because, called the because X construction (e.g., because homework). Quantitative and qualitative research as well as research about the historical development of the construction have been conducted. The present article aims to determine what motivates the use of the construction.  Methods: Based on the data collected from the literature and online sources, the grammar of the because X construction is described in detail. The construction is then analyzed  within Hirose’s (2015) three-tier model of language use.  Results: A two-layered expressive structure is proposed: The X-element serves as a private expression, which is a speaker’s expression of thought with no intention of communication, whereas the whole construction functions publicly. The private nature of the X-element consistently accounts for the syntactic categories of the X-element and the restrictions on them observed in the literature.  Conclusion: The proposed two-layered expressive structure reflects a metapragmatic function of the construction. A private, subjective expression embedded in a public expression has the function of connecting the hearer to the speaker, and it accordingly brings about a joint attention effect. With such a function, the proposed structure is effective especially (but not exclusively) in online communication because one can strategically indicate closeness or intimacy to others, particularly in an environment where nonverbal means are difficult to apply.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical model of a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine and the human immune system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marisabel Rodriguez Messan, Osman N. Yogurtcu, Joseph R. McGill, Ujwani Nukala, Zuben E. Sauna, Hong Yang</p>

Cancer vaccines are an important component of the cancer immunotherapy toolkit enhancing immune response to malignant cells by activating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Multiple successful clinical applications of cancer vaccines have shown good safety and efficacy. Despite the notable progress, significant challenges remain in obtaining consistent immune responses across heterogeneous patient populations, as well as various cancers. We present a mechanistic mathematical model describing key interactions of a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine with an individual patient’s immune system. Specifically, the model considers the vaccine concentration of tumor-specific antigen peptides and adjuvant, the patient’s major histocompatibility complexes I and II copy numbers, tumor size, T cells, and antigen presenting cells. We parametrized the model using patient-specific data from a clinical study in which individualized cancer vaccines were used to treat six melanoma patients. Model simulations predicted both immune responses, represented by T cell counts, to the vaccine as well as clinical outcome (determined as change of tumor size). This model, although complex, can be used to describe, simulate, and predict the behavior of the human immune system to a personalized cancer vaccine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">No increased circular inference in adults with high levels of autistic traits or autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nikitas Angeletos Chrysaitis, Renaud Jardri, Sophie Denève, Peggy Seriès</p>

Autism spectrum disorders have been proposed to arise from impairments in the probabilistic integration of prior knowledge with sensory inputs. Circular inference is one such possible impairment, in which excitation-to-inhibition imbalances in the cerebral cortex cause the reverberation and amplification of prior beliefs and sensory information. Recent empirical work has associated circular inference with the clinical dimensions of schizophrenia. Inhibition impairments have also been observed in autism, suggesting that signal reverberation might be present in that condition as well. In this study, we collected data from 21 participants with self-reported diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders and 155 participants with a broad range of autistic traits in an online probabilistic decision-making task (the fisher task). We used previously established Bayesian models to investigate possible associations between autistic traits or autism and circular inference. There was no correlation between prior or likelihood reverberation and autistic traits across the whole sample. Similarly, no differences in any of the circular inference model parameters were found between autistic participants and those with no diagnosis. Furthermore, participants incorporated information from both priors and likelihoods in their decisions, with no relationship between their weights and psychiatric traits, contrary to what common theories for both autism and schizophrenia would suggest. These findings suggest that there is no increased signal reverberation in autism, despite the known presence of excitation-to-inhibition imbalances. They can be used to further contrast and refine the Bayesian theories of schizophrenia and autism, revealing a divergence in the computational mechanisms underlying the two conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 2021 versus 2020 in Italy: surprises and implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Data from the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) emphasized by the media indicate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces related infections, hospitalizations and deaths. However, a comparison showed significantly more hospitalizations and intensive care unit accesses in the corresponding months and days in 2021 versus 2020 and no significant differences in deaths. The combination of non-alternative hypotheses may help explain the discrepancy between the results in the entire population and the vaccination’s success claimed by the ISS in reducing infections, serious cases and deaths: a bias: counting as unvaccinated also "those vaccinated with 1 dose in the two weeks following the inoculation", and as incompletely vaccinated also "those vaccinated with 2 doses within two weeks of the 2nd inoculation". a systematic error: counting as unvaccinated also "vaccinated with 1 dose in the two weeks following the inoculation", and as incompletely vaccinated also "vaccinated with 2 doses within two weeks of the 2nd inoculation". Many reports show an increase in COVID-19 cases in these time-windows, and related data should be separated levels of protective effectiveness in vaccinated people, often considered stable, actually show signs of progressive reduction over time, which could contribute to reducing the overall population result unvaccinated people show more severe disease than in 2020, supporting also in humans the theory of imperfect vaccines, which offer less resistance to the entry of germs than the resistance later encountered inside the human body. This favors the selection of more resistant and virulent mutants, that can be spread by vaccinated people. This damages first the unvaccinated people, but ultimately the whole community. An open scientific debate is needed to discuss these hypotheses, following the available evidence (as well as to discuss the inconsistent theory of unvaccinated young people as reservoirs of viruses/mutants), to assess the long-term and community impact of different vaccination strategies.

Methods: A total of 860 Mexicans (129 cases and 731 controls) between 18 and 25 years of age were genotyped for the ABCG2 (Q191K), SLC22A12 (517G>A), and XDH (518T>C) polymorphisms, as predisposing factors of hyperuricemia. Biochemical parameters were measured by spectrophotometry, while genetic polymorphisms were analyzed by real-time PCR. An analysis of the risk of hyperuricemia in relation to the variables studied was carried out using a logistic regression. Results: Male sex, being overweight or obese, having hypercholesterolemia or having hypertriglyceridemia were factors associated with hyperuricemia ( p ≤ 0.05). The ABCG2 polymorphism was associated with hyperuricemia (OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.41-4.17, p = 0.001) and hypercholesterolemia (OR = 4.89, 95% CI: 1.54-15.48, p = 0.003), employing a dominant model, but only in male participants. Conclusions: The ABCG2 (Q191K) polymorphism increases the risk of hyperuricemia and hypercholesterolemia in young Mexican males.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">High affinity memory B cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection produce more plasmablasts and atypical memory B cells than those primed by mRNA vaccines</a></h4>

              
                Memory B cells (MBCs) generated by different types of primary immune responses may have functional differences. Pape et al. find that SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific MBCs induced by infection had better antigen-binding capacity than vaccine-induced primary MBCs and were more efficient at generating plasmablasts and secondary MBCs.

                Wheatley et al. identify potent human monoclonal antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse and hamsters. Structural analyses reveal the diverse epitope landscape of neutralizing antibodies that will be potentially useful future anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Myopalladin knockout mice develop cardiac dilation and show a maladaptive response to mechanical pressure overload</a></h4>

              
                Myopalladin (MYPN) is a striated muscle-specific immunoglobulin domain-containing protein located in the sarcomeric Z-line and I-band. <i>MYPN</i> gene mutations are causative for dilated (DCM), hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy. In a yeast two-hybrid screening, MYPN was found to bind to titin in the Z-line, which was confirmed by microscale thermophoresis. Cardiac analyses of MYPN knockout (MKO) mice showed the development of mild cardiac dilation and systolic dysfunction, associated with decreased myofibrillar isometric tension generation and increased resting tension at longer sarcomere lengths. MKO mice exhibited a normal hypertrophic response to transaortic constriction (TAC), but rapidly developed severe cardiac dilation and systolic dysfunction, associated with fibrosis, increased fetal gene expression, higher intercalated disc fold amplitude, decreased calsequestrin-2 protein levels, and increased desmoplakin and SORBS2 protein levels. Cardiomyocyte analyses showed delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and reuptake in unstressed MKO mice as well as reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude post-TAC, suggesting that altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling may contribute to the development of DCM in MKO mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neurocomputational model of the basal ganglia for the analysis of motor deficits after dopaminergic loss in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) are part of a basic feedback circuit, regulating cortical function, such as voluntary movement control, via their influence on thalamocortical projections. BG disorders, namely Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), involve the progressive loss of motor functions. The process that leads to these neural alterations is still unknown. At the present, PD cannot be cured, but an early diagnosis (ED) could allow to better manage its symptoms and evolution. A branch of neuroscience research is currently investigating the possibility of using motor alterations, e.g. handwriting, caused by the disease as diagnostic signs in the early stage of the disease, expression of small entity of SN lesion. In the present work, we propose a neurocomputational model to investigate the behaviour of the simulated neural system after several degrees of lesion, with the aim of evaluating, if possible, which is the smallest lesion compromising motor learning. The performance of the network in learning a novel motor task has been analyzed, in physiological and pathological conditions. The proposed neural network proves that there may exist abnormalities of motor learning process, due to alterations in the BG, which do not yet involve the presence of symptoms typical of the confirmed diagnosis, since the network shows having some difficulties in motor learning already with 20% DA depletion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter hyperintensities may be an early marker for age-related cognitive decline in the ADNI cohort</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous research suggests that white matter hyperintensities, amyloid, and tau contribute to age-related cognitive decline. It remains unknown as to how these factors relate to one another and how they jointly contribute to cognitive decline in normal aging. This project examines the association between these pathologies and their relationship to cognitive decline. Methods: Cognitively normal older adult data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were examined. Participants were included if they had no subjective cognitive decline, had baseline white matter hyperintensity, CSF AB42/40, CSF pTau181, and cognitive scores. Of the 102 participants included, only 79 had follow-up cognitive scores. Linear regressions examined the influence of white matter hyperintensities, amyloid, and tau on baseline and follow-up cognitive scores. Linear regressions also examined the association of amyloid and tau on white matter hyperintensities and between tau and amyloid. Results: Increased white matter hyperintensity load was associated with lower baseline memory (B= -0.20, p =.046), follow-up executive functioning (B= -0.32, p<.001), and follow-up ADAS-13 (B=2.69, p<.001) scores. White matter hyperintensities were not related to pTau or AB42/40. Lower AB42/40 was associated with increased pTau (p=.025). pTau was not associated with decline in any cognitive score. Lower AB42/40 was associated with lower baseline (p=.015) but not follow-up executive function. Discussion: White matter hyperintensities may be one of the earliest pathologies observed in healthy older adults that contribute to cognitive decline. The inclusion of white matter hyperintensities as an additional marker for early cognitive decline may improve our current understanding of age-related changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unrestricted eye movements strengthen causal connectivity from hippocampal to oculomotor regions during scene construction</a></h4>

              
                Scene construction is a key component of memory recall, navigation, and future imagining, and relies on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). A parallel body of work suggests that eye movements may enable the imagination and construction of scenes, even in the absence of external visual input. There are vast structural and functional connections between regions of the MTL and those of the oculomotor system. However, the directionality of connections between the MTL and oculomotor control regions, and how it relates to scene construction, has not been studied directly in human neuroimaging. In the current study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate this relationship at a mechanistic level using a scene construction task in which participants' eye movements were either restricted (fixed-viewing) or unrestricted (free-viewing). By omitting external visual input, and by contrasting free- versus fixed- viewing, the directionality of neural connectivity during scene construction could be determined. As opposed to when eye movements were restricted, allowing free viewing during construction of scenes strengthened top-down connections from the MTL to the frontal eye fields, and to lower-level cortical visual processing regions, suppressed bottom-up connections along the visual stream, and enhanced vividness of the constructed scenes. Taken together, these findings provide novel, non-invasive evidence for the causal architecture between the MTL memory system and oculomotor system associated with constructing vivid mental representations of scenes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-Administration of entactogen psychostimulants dysregulates GABA and Kappa Opioid Receptor signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala of female Wistar rats</a></h4>

              
                Male rats escalate intravenous self-administration of entactogen psychostimulants, 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) under extended access conditions, as with typical psychostimulants. Here, we investigated whether female rats escalate self-administration of methylone, 3,4-methylenedioxypentedrone (pentylone), and MDMA and then studied consequences of MDMA and pentylone self-administration on GABAA receptor and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain area critically dysregulated by extended access self-administration of alcohol or cocaine. Adult female Wistar rats were trained to self-administer methylone, pentylone, MDMA (0.5 mg/kg/infusion), or saline-vehicle using a fixed-ratio 1 response contingency in 6-hour sessions (long-access: LgA) followed by progressive ratio (PR) dose-response testing. The effects of pentylone-LgA, MDMA-LgA and saline on basal GABAergic transmission (miniature postsynaptic inhibitory currents, mIPSCs) and the modulatory role of KOR at CeA GABAergic synapses were determined in acute brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp. Methylone-LgA and pentylone-LgA rats similarly escalated their drug intake (both obtained more infusions compared to MDMA-LgA rats) however, pentylone-LgA rats reached higher breakpoints in PR tests. At the cellular level, baseline CeA GABA transmission was markedly elevated in pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline-vehicle. Specifically, pentylone-LgA was associated with increased CeA mIPSC frequency (GABA release) and amplitude (postsynaptic GABAA receptor function), while mIPSC amplitudes (but not frequency) was larger in MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline rats. In addition, pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA profoundly disrupted CeA KOR signaling such as both KOR agonism (1mM U50488) and KOR antagonism (200nM nor-binaltorphimine) decreased mIPSC frequency suggesting recruitment of non-canonical KOR signaling pathways. This study confirms escalated self-administration of entactogen psychostimulants under LgA conditions in female rats which is accompanied by increased CeA GABAergic inhibition and altered KOR signaling. Collectively, our study suggests that CeA GABA and KOR mechanisms play a critical role in entactogen self-administration like those observed with escalation of alcohol or cocaine self-administration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning of biased representations in LIP through interactions between recurrent connectivity and Hebbian plasticity</a></h4>

              
                When monkeys learn to group visual stimuli into arbitrary categories, lateral intraparietal area (LIP) neurons become category-selective. Surprisingly, the representations of learned categories are overwhelmingly biased: nearly all LIP neurons in a given animal prefer the same category over other behaviorally equivalent categories. We propose a model where such biased representations develop through the interplay between Hebbian plasticity and the recurrent connectivity of LIP. In this model, two separable processes of positive feedback unfold in parallel: in one, category selectivity emerges from competition between prefrontal inputs; in the other, bias develops due to lateral interactions among LIP neurons. This model reproduces the levels of category selectivity and bias observed under a variety of conditions, as well as the redevelopment of bias after monkeys learn redefined categories. It predicts that LIP receptive fields would spatially cluster by preferred category, which we experimentally confirm. In summary, our model reveals a mechanism by which LIP learns abstract representations and assigns meaning to sensory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapamycin attenuated zinc-induced tau phosphorylation and oxidative stress in animal model: Involvement of dual mTOR/p70S6K and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease is pathologically featured by abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta plaque, neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Metal dysregulation including excessive zinc released by presynaptic neurons plays an important role in tau pathology and oxidase activation. The activities of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) are elevated in the brains of patients with Alzheimers disease. Zinc induces tau hyperphosphorylation via mTOR/P70S6K activation in vitro. However, the involvement of mTOR/P70S6K pathway in zinc-induced oxidative stress, tau degeneration, synaptic and cognitive impairment, has not been fully elucidated in vivo. Here we assessed in the effect of pathological concentration of zinc in SH-SY5Y cells by using biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Rats (n = 18, male) were lateral ventricularly-injected with zinc and treated with rapamycin (intraperitoneal injection) for one week and assessed using Morris water maze. Evaluation of the oxidative stress, tau phorsphylation and synaptic impairment were performed using the hippocampus tissue of the rats by biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Results from Morris water maze showed that the capacity of spatial memory is impaired in zinc-treated rats. Zinc sulfate significantly increased the levels of P-mTOR Ser2448, P-p70S6K Thr389, and P-tau Ser356, and decreased levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in SH-SY5Y cells and in zinc-treated rats compared with control groups. Increased expressions of reactive oxygen species were observed in zinc sulfate-induced SH-SY5Y cells as well as in the hippocampus of zinc-injected rats. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, rescued the zinc-induced increases in mTOR/p70S6K activations, tau phosphorylation and oxidative stress, as well as Nrf2/HO-1 inactivation, cognitive impairment and synaptic impairment reduced the expression of synapse-related proteins in zinc-injected rats. In conclusion, our findings imply that rapamycin prevents zinc-induced cognitive impairment and protects neurons from tau pathology, oxidative stress and synaptic impairment, by decreasing mTOR/p70S6K hyperactivity and increasing Nrf2/HO-1 activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanics Of Ultrasonic Neuromodulation In A Mouse Subject</a></h4>

              
                Ultrasound neuromodulation (UNM), where a region in the brain is targeted by focused ultrasound (FUS), which, in turn, causes excitation or inhibition of neural activity, has recently received considerable attention as a promising tool for neuroscience. Despite its great potential, several aspects of UNM are still unknown. An important question pertains to the off-target sensory effects of UNM and their dependence on stimulation frequency. To understand these effects, we have developed a finite-element model of a mouse, including elasticity and viscoelasticity, and used it to interrogate the response of mouse models to focused ultrasound (FUS). We find that, while some degree of focusing and magnification of the signal is achieved within the brain, the induced pressure-wave pattern is complex and delocalized. In addition, we find that the brain is largely insulated, or 'cloaked', from shear waves by the cranium and that the shear waves are largely carried away from the skull by the vertebral column, which acts as a waveguide. We find that, as expected, this waveguide mechanism is strongly frequency dependent, which may contribute to the frequency dependence of UNM effects. Our calculations further suggest that off-target skin locations experience displacements and stresses at levels that, while greatly attenuated from the source, could nevertheless induce sensory responses in the subject.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model-based dynamic off-resonance correction for improved accelerated fMRI in awake behaving non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To estimate dynamic off-resonance due to vigorous body motion in accelerated fMRI of awake behaving non-human primates (NHPs) using the standard EPI 3-line navigator, in order to attenuate the effects of time-varying off-resonance on the reconstruction. Methods: In NHP fMRI the animal's head is usually head-posted, and the dynamic off-resonance is mainly caused by motion in body parts that are distant from the brain and have low spatial frequency. Hence, off-resonance at each frame can be approximated as a spatially linear perturbation of the off-resonance at a reference frame, and is manifested as a relative linear shift in k-space. Using GRAPPA operators, we estimated these shifts by comparing the 3-line navigator at each time frame with that at the reference frame. Estimated shifts were then used to correct the data at each frame. The proposed method was evaluated in phantom scans, simulations, and in vivo data. Results: The proposed method is shown to successfully estimate low-spatial order dynamic off-resonance perturbations, including induced linear off-resonance perturbations in phantoms, and is able to correct retrospectively corrupted data in simulations. Finally, it is shown to reduce ghosting artifacts and geometric distortions by up to 20% in simultaneous multi-slice in vivo acquisitions in awake-behaving NHPs. Conclusion: A method is proposed that does not need any sequence modification or extra acquisitions and makes accelerated awake behaving NHP imaging more robust and reliable, reducing the gap between what is possible with NHP protocols and state-of-the-art human imaging.

                GNAO1 encodes Go, a heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit in the Gi/o family. In this report, we used a Gnao1 mouse model G203R previously described as a gain-of-function Gnao1 mutant with movement abnormalities and enhanced seizure susceptibility. Here, we report an unexpected second mutation resulting in a loss-of-function Go protein and describe alterations in central synaptic transmission. Whole cell patch clamp recordings from Purkinje cells (PCs) in acute cerebellar slices from Gnao1 mutant mice showed significantly lower frequencies of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) compared to WT mice. There was no significant change in sEPSCs or mEPSCs. Whereas mIPSC frequency was reduced, mIPSC amplitudes were not affected, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism of action. A modest decrease in the number of molecular layer interneurons was insufficient to explain the magnitude of IPSC suppression. Paradoxically, Gi/o inhibitors (pertussis toxin), enhanced the mutant-suppressed mIPSC frequency and eliminated the difference between WT and Gnao1 mice. While GABAB receptor regulates mIPSCs, neither agonists nor antagonists of this receptor altered function in the mutant mouse PCs. This study is the first electrophysiological investigation of the role of Gi/o protein in cerebellar synaptic transmission using an animal model with a loss-of-function Gi/o protein.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha oscillations link action to cognition: An oculomotor account of the brain's dominant rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Power modulations in alpha oscillations (8-14Hz) have been associated with most human cognitive functions and psychopathological conditions studied. These reports are often inconsistent with the prevailing view of a specific relationship of alpha oscillations to attention and working memory (WM). We propose that conceptualizing the role of alpha oscillations in oculomotor control resolves this inconsistency. This proposition is based on a review of results across species (human Npooled=295, one non-human primate, honey bee N=5), experimental conditions (rest, attention, and working memory), and recording techniques (EEG, ECOG, eye-tracking, and MEG) that encourage the following relationships between alpha oscillations and eye-movement control: (i) saccade initiation prompts power decrease in brain circuits associated with saccadic control; (ii) the direction of a saccade is consistent with alpha lateralization, both during task and resting conditions; (iii) the phase of alpha activity informs saccade occurrence and biases miniature eye movements during fixation (e.g. fixational tremor); and (iv) oculomotor action differentiates WM load. A new theory on how alpha oscillations link oculomotor action to cognition is proposed. Generalizing across tasks and species: low oculomotor activity is associated with high alpha power and vice versa. Alpha oscillations regulate how long to look at a given target and how fast to saccade to a next. By ensuring steady gaze position, any potential input outside foveal vision is 'suppressed'.

                Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating central nervous system (CNS) disease with no satisfying therapies available. Mobilizing endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) to trigger intrinsic regeneration exhibits promising potentials for SCI repair. However, neurogenesis from endogenous NSCs is extremely restricted in the non-neurogenic spinal cord after SCI. Accumulation of protein aggregates has been shown to impede quiescent NSCs activation and the subsequent neurogenesis. Here, we found that ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase l-1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinating enzyme, functioned to regulate NSCs activation and neurogenesis by reducing protein aggregations through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) in vitro. Upregulation of UCHL1 in spinal cord NSCs of rats with complete transection SCI efficiently enhanced NSCs proliferation and neurogenesis, leading to significantly improved functional outcomes. Based on protein microarray analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), our results revealed that A1 reactive astrocytes acted to restrict NSCs neurogenesis by negatively regulating UCHL1-depentdent protein aggregates removal via the C3/Nrf2 signaling. Indeed, blockade of A1 astrocytes using neutralizing antibodies after SCI also led to NSCs activation, increased neurogenesis and remarkably enhanced motor function recovery. This study not only revealed a novel mechanism regulating NSCs-medicated neurogenesis in the spinal cord, but also provided new molecular targets for neural repair strategies after SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Knowledge-driven perceptual organization reshapes information sampling via eye movements</a></h4>

              
                Humans constantly move their eyes to explore the environment and obtain information. Competing theories of gaze guidance consider the factors driving eye movements within a dichotomy between low-level visual features and high-level object representations. However, recent developments in object perception indicate a complex and intricate relationship between features and objects. Specifically, image-independent object-knowledge can generate objecthood by dynamically reconfiguring how feature space is carved up by the visual system. Here, we adopt this emerging perspective of object perception, moving away from the simplifying dichotomy between features and objects in explanations of gaze guidance. We recorded eye movements in response to stimuli that appear as meaningless patches on initial viewing but are experienced as coherent objects once relevant object-knowledge has been acquired. We demonstrate that gaze guidance differs substantially depending on whether observers experienced the same stimuli as meaningless patches or organised them into object representations. In particular, fixations on identical images became object-centred, less dispersed, and more consistent across observers once exposed to relevant prior object-knowledge. Observers' gaze behaviour also indicated a shift from exploratory information-sampling to a strategy of extracting information mainly from selected, object-related image areas. These effects were evident from the first fixations on the image. Importantly, however, eye-movements were not fully determined by object representations but were best explained by a simple model that integrates image-computable features and high-level, knowledge-dependent object representations. Overall, the results show how information sampling via eye-movements in humans is guided by a dynamic interaction between image-computable features and knowledge-driven perceptual organisation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disynaptic Effect of Hilar Cells on Pattern Separation in A Spiking Neural Network of Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                We investigate the disynaptic effect of the hilar cells on pattern separation in a spiking neural network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The principal granule cells (GCs) in the DG perform pattern separation, transforming similar input patterns into less-similar output patterns. In our DG network, the hilus consists of excitatory mossy cells (MCs) and inhibitory HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated) cells. Here, we consider the disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells on the GCs, mediated by the inhibitory basket cells (BCs) in the granular layer; MC [-&gt;] BC [-&gt;] GC and HIPP [-&gt;] BC [-&gt;] GC. Disynaptic inhibition from the MCs tends to decrease the firing activity of the GCs. On the other hand, the HIPP cells disinhibit the intermediate BCs, which leads to increasing the activity of the GCs. By changing the synaptic strength K(BC, X) [from the presynaptic X (= MC or HIPP) to the postsynaptic BC] from the default value K(BC, X)*, we study the change in the pattern separation degree Sd. When decreasing K(BC, MC) or independently increasing K(BC, HIPP) from their default values, Sd is found to decrease (i.e., pattern separation is reduced). On the other hand, as K(BC, MC) is increased or independently K(BC, HIPP) is decreased from their default values, pattern separation becomes enhanced (i.e., Sd increases). In this way, the disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells on the pattern separation are opposite ones. Thus, when simultaneously varying both K(BC, MC) and K(BC, HIPP), as a result of balance between the two competing disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells, Sd forms a bell-shaped curve with an optimal maximum at their default values. Moreover, we also investigate population and individual behaviors of the sparsely synchronized rhythm of the GCs, and find that the amplitude measure Ma (representing population synchronization degree) and the random-phase-locking degree Ld (denoting individual activity degree) are strongly correlated with the pattern separation degree Sd. Consequently, the larger the synchronization and the random phase-locking degrees of the sparsely synchronized rhythm is, the more the pattern separation becomes enhanced.

                Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by nerve tumors called neurofibromas, in which Schwann cells (SCs) lack NF1 and show deregulated RAS signaling. NF1 is also implicated in regulation of cAMP. Gene expression profiling and protein expression identified P2RY14 in SCs and SC precursors (SCPs) implicating P2RY14 as a candidate upstream regulator of cAMP in EGF-dependent SCP. We found that SCP self-renewal was reduced by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of P2RY14. In NF1 deficient SCs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, P2RY14 inhibition decreased EGFR-driven phospho-Akt and increased cAMP signaling. In a neurofibroma mouse model, genetic deletion of P2RY14 increased mouse survival, delayed neurofibroma initiation and rescued cAMP signaling. Conversely, elevation of cAMP diminished SCP number in vitro and diminished SC proliferation in neurofibroma bearing mice in vivo. These studies identify the purinergic receptor P2RY14 as a critical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in NF1 mutant SCPs and SCs and suggest roles for EGFR-GPCR crosstalk in facilitating SCP self-renewal and neurofibroma initiation via cAMP and EGFR-driven phospho-Akt.

                Obesity is a current epidemic, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Chronic obesity is characterized by a low grade systemic inflammation besides not being a classic inflammatory disease. Many studies have tried to identify inflammatory insults dysregulated by a Westernized diet consisted of high fat, high sucrose, and high cholesterol mainly focusing on production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The gut microbiome and derived metabolites, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, have received increased attention as underlying some of the obesogenic features. In the present work, we utilized a novel biosensor mouse model capable of monitoring in vivo inflammation. We observed tissue- and sex- specific caspase 1 activation patterns in obese mice and treated with butyrate. Our work utilizing a caspase-1 biosensor mouse model, flow cytometry and computational analyses and offers new mechanistic insights underlying the effect of butyrate in obesity and its complications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing brain state-dependent pupil dynamics based on lateral hypothalamic activity</a></h4>

              
                Pupil dynamics presents varied correlation features with brain activity under different vigilant levels. The modulation of brain state changes can arise from the lateral hypothalamus (LH), where diverse neuronal cell types contribute to arousal regulation in opposite directions via the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the relationship of the LH and pupil dynamics has seldom been investigated. Here, we performed local field potential (LFP) recordings at the LH and ACC, and the whole brain fMRI with simultaneous fiber photometry Ca2+ recording in the ACC, to evaluate their correlation with brain state-dependent pupil dynamics. Both LFP and functional MRI (fMRI) data showed opposite correlation features to pupil dynamics, demonstrating an LH activity-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the correlation of pupil dynamics with ACC LFP and whole-brain fMRI signals depends on LH activity, indicating a role of the latter in brain state regulation.

                Rapidly growing evidence demonstrates that flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through perivascular spaces (PVSs) - annular tunnels surrounding vasculature in the brain - is a critically-important component of neurophysiology. CSF inflow contributes during physiological conditions to clearance of metabolic waste and in pathological situations to edema formation. However, brain-wide imaging methods cannot resolve PVSs, and high-resolution methods cannot access deep tissue or be applied to human subjects, so theoretical models provide essential insight. We model this CSF pathway as a network of hydraulic resistances, built from published parameters. A few parameters have very wide uncertainties, so we focus on the limits of their feasible ranges by analyzing different parametric scenarios. We identify low-resistance PVSs and high-resistance parenchyma (brain tissue) as the scenario that best explains experimental observations. Our results point to the most important parameters that should be measured in future experiments. Extensions of our modeling may help predict stroke severity or lead to neurological disease treatments and drug delivery methods.

                Abnormal NMDAr function has been linked to rhythmopathies, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Here, we investigate the role of NMDAr hypofunction in pathological oscillations and behavior. We implanted mice with tetrodes in the dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and administered them with the NMDAr antagonist MK801, recording oscillations during spontaneous exploration in an open field and in the y-maze spatial working memory test. Our results show that NMDAr blockade increased locomotor activity and impaired spatial working memory. The administration of MK801 disrupted the correlation between oscillations and speed of movement, crucial for internal representations of distance. In the hippocampus, MK801 impaired gamma oscillations and theta/gamma coupling, while in the mPFC, it increased the power of theta, gamma, and generated high-frequency oscillations (HFO 155-185 Hz). Spatial working memory tests in the y-maze revealed that theta/gamma coupling was consistently higher in correct trials. Theta/gamma co-modulation mediated by NMDAr function might be key to explain various of schizophrenia's cognitive symptoms. Further investigating NMDAr hypofunction's role in the emergence of aberrant oscillatory activity will improve our understanding of schizophrenia and inspire new treatments of psychiatric disorders.

                Going beyond previous research, we use strength-dependent perturbation to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the emergence of large-scale brain activity. Despite decades of research, we still have a shallow understanding of the role and generating mechanisms of the ubiquitous fluctuations and oscillations found in recordings of brain dynamics. Here, we used global strength-dependent perturbation to give a causal mechanistic description of human brain function providing a delicate balance between fluctuation and oscillation on the edge of criticality. After application of precise local strength-dependent perturbations and measuring the well-known perturbative complexity index, we demonstrated that the overall balance is shifted towards a fluctuating regime which is superior in terms of enhancing different functional networks compared to the oscillatory regime. This framework can generate specific, testable empirical predictions to be tested in human stimulation studies with strength-dependent rather than constant perturbation. Overall, our novel strength-dependent perturbation framework demonstrates that the human brain is poised on the edge of criticality, between fluctuations to oscillations, allowing for maximal flexibility.

                Developmental delays in infanthood often persist, turning into life-long difficulties, and coming at great cost for the individual and community. By examining the developing brain and its relation to developmental outcomes we can start to elucidate how the emergence of brain circuits is manifested in variability of infant motor, cognitive and behavioural capacities. In this study, we examined if cortical structural covariance at birth, indexing coordinated development, is related to later infant behaviour. We included 193 healthy term-born infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). An individual cortical connectivity matrix derived from morphological and microstructural features was computed for each subject (morphometric similarity networks, MSNs) and was used as input for prediction of behavioural scores at 18 months using Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM). Neonatal MSNs successfully predicted language and social-emotional performance. Predictive edges were distributed between and within known functional cortical divisions with a specific important role for primary and posterior cortical regions. These results reveal that multi-modal neonatal cortical profiles showing coordinated maturation are related to developmental outcomes and that network organization at birth provides an early infrastructure for future functional skills.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LXR agonist Prevents Peripheral Neuropathy and modifies PNS immune cells in Aged Mice</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral neuropathy is a common and progressive disorder in the elderly that interferes with daily activities and increases the risk of injury. It is of importance to find efficient treatments to treat or delay this age-related neurodegeneration. We previously demonstrated that activation of the cholesterol sensor Liver X receptor (LXR) with the potent agonist GW3965, alleviates pain in a diet-induced obesity model. Because cholesterol had also been linked to neuropathy during aging, we sought to test whether LXR activation may improve neuropathy and pain in aged mice by treating 21-month-old mice for 3 months with GW3965. Treatment resulted in a significant increase in nerve fibers of the sub-basal plexus, accompanied by a change in polarization, metabolism, and cholesterol content of macrophages in the sciatic nerve. These results suggest that activation of the LXR may block the progression of neuropathy associated with aging by modifying nerve-immune cell cholesterol, thereby providing new pathways to target in efforts to delay neuropathy during aging.

                Advances in behavioral optogenetics are limited by the absence of high-throughput pipelines for the automated analysis of behavior in freely behaving animals. Although a variety of AI algorithms has been proposed that enable automation of behavioral analysis, existing methods are generally low-throughput. In addition, optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits typically requires physical tethers to light sources, which limits the number of brain areas that can be targeted and thus constrains behavioral testing. Here, we develop a new wireless platform that combines a battery-free dual-channel optogenetic implant with an AI algorithm for high-throughput behavioral analysis. In our platform, a customized AI algorithm detected and quantified freezing behavior of rats that had undergone fear conditioning. Notably, our platform allows up to four enclosures to be monitored simultaneously. Wireless dual-channel optogenetic devices were implanted in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to permit independent modulation of BLA principal neurons (red light, AAV-CaMKII-JAWS) or BLA interneurons (blue light, AAV-mDlx-ChR2) in freely behaving animals. In vivo validation with behaving rats demonstrates the utility of the telemetry system for large-scale optogenetic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leveling up: improving power in fMRI by moving beyond cluster-level inference</a></h4>

              
                Inference in neuroimaging commonly occurs at the level of "clusters" of neighboring voxels or connections, thought to reflect functionally specific brain areas. Yet increasingly large studies reveal effects that are shared throughout the brain, suggesting that reported clusters may only reflect the "tip of the iceberg" of underlying effects. Here, we empirically compare power of traditional levels of inference (edge and cluster) with broader levels of inference (network and whole-brain) by resampling functional connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project (n=40, 80, 120). Only network- and whole brain-level inference attained or surpassed "adequate" power ({beta} =80%) to detect an average effect, with almost double the power for network- compared with cluster-level procedures at more typical sample sizes. Likewise, effects tended to be widespread, and more widespread pooling resulted in stronger magnitude effects. Power also substantially increased when controlling FDR rather than FWER. Importantly, there may be similar implications for task-based activation analyses where effects are also increasingly understood to be widespread. However, increased power with broader levels of inference may diminish the specificity to localize effects, especially for non-task contexts. These findings underscore the benefit of shifting the scale of inference to better capture the underlying signal, which may unlock opportunities for discovery in human neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A rise-to-threshold signal for a relative value deliberation</a></h4>

              
                Whereas progress has been made in identifying neural signals related to rapid, cued decisions, less is known about how brains guide and terminate more ethologically relevant deliberations, where an animal's own behavior governs the options experienced over minutes. Drosophila search for many seconds to minutes for egg-laying sites with high relative value and neurons, called oviDNs, exist whose activity fulfills necessity and sufficiency criteria for initiating the egg-deposition motor program. Here we show that oviDNs express a calcium signal that rises over seconds to minutes as a fly deliberates whether to lay an egg. The calcium signal dips when an egg is internally prepared (ovulated), rises at a rate related to the relative value of the current substrate being experienced, and reaches a consistent peak just prior to the abdomen bend for egg deposition. We provide perturbational evidence that the egg-deposition motor program is initiated once this signal hits a threshold and that sub-threshold variation in the signal regulates the time spent deliberating and, ultimately, the option chosen. These results argue that a rise-to-threshold signal guides Drosophila to lay eggs on substrate options with high relative value, with each egg-laying event representing a self-paced decision similar to real-world decisions made by humans and other mammals.

                To reduce reliance on opioids for the treatment of pain in the clinic, ongoing work is testing the utility of cannabinoid drugs as a potential alternative for treatment of chronic pain and/or as a strategy for reducing opioid drug dosage and duration of treatment (i.e., so-called opioid-sparing effects). Previous preclinical work has shown robust anti-hyperalgesic effects of systemic THC and acute anti-hyperalgesic effects of vaporized THC. Here, we used a vapor inhalation model in rats to test chronic THC vapor inhalation effects on thermal nociception and mechanical sensitivity, as well as midbrain (i.e., periaqueductal gray [PAG]) neuronal function, in adult male rats with chronic inflammatory pain. We report that chronic THC vapor inhalation produces a robust anti-hyperalgesic effect in rats with chronic inflammatory pain, and that this effect persists 24 hours after cessation of THC exposure. We demonstrate that chronic THC vapor inhalation also modulates intrinsic and synaptic properties of ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) neurons, including reductions in action potential firing rate and reductions in spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission, and that these effects occur specifically in neurons that respond to current input with a delayed firing phenotype. Finally, we show that the suppressive effect of the bath-applied mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist DAMGO on synaptic inhibition in the vlPAG is enhanced in slices taken from rats with a history of chronic THC vapor inhalation. Collectively, these data show that chronic THC vapor inhalation produces lasting attenuation of thermal hyperalgesia and reduces synaptic inhibition in the vlPAG of rats with chronic inflammatory pain.

                What is the cognitive and neural architecture of systems for high-level reasoning and memory in humans? We ask this question using deep neuroimaging of individual human brains on various tasks involving reasoning and memory about familiar people, places, and objects. We find that thinking about people and places elicits responses in distinct but parallel networks within high-level association cortex, spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Person- and place-preferring brain regions were systematically yoked across multiple cortical zones. These regions were strongly category-selective, across visual, semantic, and episodic tasks, and were specifically functionally connected to other parts of association cortex with similar category preferences. These results demonstrate that selectivity for content domain is a widespread feature of high-level association cortex in humans. They support a theoretical model in which reasoning about people and places are supported by parallel cognitive and neural mechanisms.

                Characterization of the interwoven complexities of early cortical thickness development has been an ongoing undertaking in neuroscience research. Longitudinal studies of Non-Human Primates (NHP) offer unique advantages to categorizing the diverse patterns of cortical growth trajectories. Here, we used latent growth models to characterize the trajectories of typical cortical thickness development in Japanese macaques at each cortical surface vertex (i.e. grayordinate). Cortical thickness from 4 to 36 months showed regional specific linear and non-linear trajectories and distinct maturation timing across the cortex. Intriguingly, we revealed a "accumulation/ablation phenomenon" of cortical maturation where the most profound development changes in cortical thickness occur in the accumulation or ablation zones surrounding the focal points (i.e., a center of a delineated regions where cortical thickness is thickest or thinnest) throughout the brain. We further examined maternal diet and inflammation in the context of these typical brain trajectories and known network architecture. A well-controlled NHP model of a maternal "Western-style" diet was used alongside measures of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the mothers during gestation. We observed that these accumulation and ablation zones of variable change might be most susceptible to environmental effects. The maternal factors, diet and inflammation during pregnancy were distinctively associated with different aspects of offspring cortical development reflected in regions related to distinctive functional networks. Our findings characterize the versatile intricacies of typical cortical thickness development and highlight how the maternal environment plays a role in offspring cortical development.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects 6.2 million people age 65 and older in the U.S. alone, and is the leading cause of dementia. Moreover, AD can lead to visual impairment, and AD histopathology also manifests in the retina. However, the factors that modulate AD pathophysiology and lead to varied susceptibility and presentation in the population are not well understood. In this context, traumatic brain injury (TBI), which can arise from sport concussions, military combat, and other causes, is associated with a 2.3-fold higher risk of developing AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Thus, we set out to evaluate the effects of TBI, AD, and their combination, on retinal histopathology. Several animal models have been developed to investigate the mechanisms underlying AD, but many have been limited by imperfect recapitulation of human pathology, and no model of TBI-associated AD (AD-TBI) has been characterized. To address this gap, we generated an innovative model of AD-TBI by taking advantage of a transgenic rat model (Tg-F344-AD) shown to recapitulate the main features of human AD pathology, and combining it with a two-time unilateral controlled cortical impact paradigm to mimic repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI). Histopathological analyses at four months post-impact confirm the presence of AD markers in transgenic retinas, and an increased severity of AD pathology due to TBI. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of the effects of TBI on AD retinopathy, with implications for patient care and therapeutic development.

	<p>Healthy aging is characterized by macrostructural sleep changes and alterations of regional electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep features. However, the spatiotemporal EEG pattern of the wake-sleep transition has never been described in the elderly. The present study aimed to assess the topographical and temporal features of the EEG during the sleep onset (SO) in a group of 36 older participants (59–81 years). The topography of the 1 Hz bins’ EEG power and the time course of the EEG frequency bands were assessed. Moreover, we compared the delta activity and delta/beta ratio between the older participants and a group of young adults. The results point to several peculiarities in the elderly: (a) the generalized post-SO power increase in the slowest frequencies did not include the 7 Hz bin; (b) the alpha power revealed a frequency-specific pattern of post-SO modifications; (c) the sigma activity exhibited only a slight post-SO increase, and its highest bins showed a frontotemporal power decrease. Older adults showed a generalized reduction of delta power and delta/beta ratio in both pre- and post-SO intervals compared to young adults. From a clinical standpoint, the regional EEG activity may represent a target for brain stimulation techniques to reduce SO latency and sleep fragmentation.</p>

	<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple metabolic dysfunctions including defects in mitochondrial homeostasis and functions. Although we have recently reported age-related changes in the respiratory capacities in different brain areas in HD mice, the precise mechanisms of how mitochondria become compromised in HD are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated mRNA and protein levels of selected subunits of electron transport system (ETS) complexes and ATP-synthase in the cortex and striatum of symptomatic R6/2 mice. Our findings reveal a brain-region-specific differential expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded ETS components, indicating defects of transcription, translation and/or mitochondrial import of mitochondrial ETS components in R6/2 mouse brains.</p>

	<p>Functional connectivity, representing a statistical coupling relationship between different brain regions or electrodes, is an influential concept in clinical medicine and cognitive neuroscience. Electroencephalography-derived functional connectivity (EEG-FC) provides relevant characteristic information about individual differences in cognitive tasks and personality traits. However, it remains unclear whether these individual-dependent EEG-FCs remain relatively permanent across long-term sessions. This manuscript utilizes machine learning algorithms to explore the individual specificity and permanence of resting-state EEG connectivity patterns. We performed six recordings at different intervals during a six-month period to examine the variation and permanence of resting-state EEG-FC over a long period. The results indicated that the EEG-FC networks are quite subject-specific with a high-precision identification accuracy of greater than 90%. Meanwhile, the individual specificity remained stable and only varied slightly after six months. Furthermore, the specificity is mainly derived from the internal connectivity of the frontal lobe. Our work demonstrates the existence of specific and permanent EEG-FC patterns in the brain, providing potential information for biometric applications.</p>

	<p>Research suggests that inter-individual differences in the degree of state attachment variability are related to differences in trait attachment and psychological problems between children. In this study, we tested whether such associations are also relevant at a within-person level, and if so, whether intra-individual fluctuations in the degree of variability were predictive of or predicted by intra-individual fluctuations in trait attachment and psychological problems. Children (N = 152; Mage = 10.41 years, SDage = 0.60 at time 1) were tested three times over a period of one year. At each timepoint, children reported on their expectations of maternal support in different distressing situations. Additionally, we administered measures of trait attachment to children and psychological problems to children and their mothers. We used Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models to distinguish between-person from within-person associations between these constructs over time. The results revealed that the degree of state attachment variability was mainly relevant to understand differences between children in trait attachment and psychological problems: children who overall showed more state attachment variability were overall less securely attached at a trait-level and reported more psychological problems. Although evidence for within-person associations was less robust, there was some indication that the degree of state attachment variability might be related to the development of trust and psychological problems at a within-person level.</p>

	<p>Genetic analysis of the association between alcohol, cocaine, and opiate addiction and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) and serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 1B and 2C (HTR1B 21 and HTR2C) pathway genes was performed in a sample of 302 polyconsumers. Our genetic association analysis revealed a significant association between a 184 base pair (bp) VNTR polymorphism in the MAOB gene and addiction to cocaine and opiates. This work highlights new genetic marker associations in cocaine and opiate polyconsumer addictions. These data help to clarify and quantify the complex role of genetics in addictive disorders, as well as their future contribution to the prevention (genetic counselling), diagnosis (genetic diagnosis of vulnerability), and treatment (pharmacogenomics) of these disorders.</p>

	<p>We aimed to assess whether dynamic arterial spin labeling (dASL), a novel quantitative MRI technique with minimal contamination of subject motion and physiological noises, could detect the longitudinal effect of focused attention meditation (FAM) on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). A total of 10 novice meditators who recorded their FAM practice time were scanned at baseline and at the 2-month follow-up. Two-month meditation practice caused significantly increased rsFC between the left medial temporal (LMT) seed and precuneus area and between the right frontal eye (RFE) seed and medial prefrontal cortex. Meditation practice time was found to be positively associated with longitudinal changes of rsFC between the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN), between DMN and insula, and between DAN and the frontoparietal control network (FPN) but negatively associated with changes of rsFC between DMN and FPN, and between DAN and visual regions. These findings demonstrate the capability of dASL in identifying the FAM-induced rsFC changes and suggest that the practice of FAM can strengthen the efficient control of FPN on fast switching between DMN and DAN and enhance the utilization of attentional resources with reduced focus on visual processing.</p>

	<p>Background. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which diagnosis is usually challenging. Biomarkers are needed for diagnosis and monitoring. In this study, we aimed to evaluate Electroencephalography (EEG) as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PPA. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 40 PPA patients categorized as non-fluent, semantic, and logopenic variants, and 20 controls. Resting-state EEG with 32 channels was acquired and preprocessed using several procedures (quantitative EEG, wavelet transformation, autoencoders, and graph theory analysis). Seven machine learning algorithms were evaluated (Decision Tree, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Naive Bayes). Results. Diagnostic capacity to distinguish between PPA and controls was high (accuracy 75%, F1-score 83% for kNN algorithm). The most important features in the classification were derived from network analysis based on graph theory. Conversely, discrimination between PPA variants was lower (Accuracy 58% and F1-score 60% for kNN). Conclusions. The application of ML to resting-state EEG may have a role in the diagnosis of PPA, especially in the differentiation from controls. Future studies with high-density EEG should explore the capacity to distinguish between PPA variants.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The perirhinal (PER) and postrhinal (POR) cortices, structures in the medial temporal lobe, are implicated in learning and memory. The PER is understood to process object information and the POR to process spatial or contextual information. Whether the medial temporal lobe is dedicated to memory, however, is under debate. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that the PER and POR are also involved in non-mnemonic cognitive functions. Rats with PER or POR damage and SHAM surgical controls were shaped, trained, and tested on the five-choice serial reaction time (5CSRT) task, which assesses attention and executive function. Rats with PER damage were impaired in acquiring the task and at asymptote, although processing information about objects was not relevant to the task. When confronted with attentional challenges, rats with PER damage showed a pattern consistent with decreased attentional capacity, increased response errors, and increased impulsive behavior. Rats with POR damage showed intact acquisition and normal asymptotic performance. They also exhibited faster latencies in the absence of speed accuracy trade-off suggesting enhanced response readiness. We suggest this increased response readiness results from decreased automatic monitoring of the local environment, which might normally compete with response readiness. Our findings are consistent with a role for PER in controlled attention and a role for POR in stimulus-driven attention providing evidence that the PER and POR cortices have functions that go beyond memory for objects and memory for scenes and contexts, respectively. These findings provide new evidence for functional specialization in the medial temporal lobe.</p>

                Background: Diabetes is a disease that affects people worldwide, including in Indonesia. The prevalence of diabetes in Indonesia is increasing from year to year. One of the most devastating complications of diabetes mellitus is diabetic ulcers, which is a limb-threatening complication. Over the past few decades, ozone generated using plasma medical technology has been investigated as an agent that helps wound healing. This study aims to evaluate the effects of topical ozonated virgin coconut oil (VCO) in a diabetic wound mouse model. Methods: This study was an experimental study with a post-test control design. An ulcer wound model was made in 50 diabetic male Wistar mice, divided into five groups, and a control group of 10 non-diabetic mice. The control groups were given conventional therapy only and the treatment groups were also given topical ozonated VCO with different flow durations (0 min, 90 min, 7 h, 14 h). Macroscopic appearance and wound contraction were observed. HSP90β, VEGF-A, EGF, bFGF, and CD34 levels were measured from the immunostained slices of wound margins. Results: The reduction of wound length was proportionally related to the duration of ozone flow. Ozonated VCO with a longer duration of ozone flow healed the wound more quickly and had the shortest wound length. VCO with ozone flow for 14 hours (16837.10 µm) had the biggest reduction in wound length compared to other groups. The wounds treated with ozonated VCO showed an increase in HSP90β, VEGF-A, EGF, bFGF, and CD34 levels that correlated to improved wound healing. A longer period of treatment resulted in higher levels of wound healing biomarkers compared to shorter therapeutic durations. Conclusions: Topical ozonated VCO improved the wound healing process in a diabetic ulcer mouse model by improving macroscopic wound appearance and increasing levels of wound healing biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The in vitro direct mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) for the early evaluation of TB vaccine candidates and assessment of protective immunity: a protocol for non-human primate cells [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The only currently available approach to early efficacy testing of tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates is in vivo preclinical challenge models. These typically include mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs), which must be exposed to virulent M.tb in a ‘challenge’ experiment following vaccination in order to evaluate protective efficacy. This procedure results in disease development and is classified as ‘Moderate’ in severity under EU legislation and UK ASPA licensure. Furthermore, experiments are relatively long and animals must be maintained in high containment level facilities, making them relatively costly. We describe an in vitro protocol for the direct mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) for use in the macaque model of TB vaccine development with the aim of overcoming some of these limitations. Importantly, using an in vitro assay in place of in vivo M.tb challenge represents a significant refinement to the existing procedure for early vaccine efficacy testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell and autologous serum samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated control animals are co-cultured with mycobacteria in a 48-well plate format for 96 hours. Adherent monocytes are then lysed to release intracellular mycobacteria which is quantified using the BACTEC MGIT system and colony-forming units determined relative to an inoculum control and stock standard curve. We discuss related optimisation and characterisation experiments, and review evidence that the direct NHP MGIA provides a biologically relevant model of vaccine-induced protection. The potential end-users of the NHP MGIA are academic and industry organisations that conduct the assessment of TB vaccine candidates and associated protective immunity using the NHP model. This approach aims to provide a method for high-throughput down-selection of vaccine candidates going forward to in vivo efficacy testing, thus expediting the development of a more efficacious TB vaccine and offering potential refinement and reduction to the use of NHPs for this purpose.

                <p>by Hyun Gyu Lee, Kyoung J. Lee</p>

The dispersal or mixing of cells within cellular tissue is a crucial property for diverse biological processes, ranging from morphogenesis, immune action, to tumor metastasis. With the phenomenon of ‘contact inhibition of locomotion,’ it is puzzling how cells achieve such processes within a densely packed cohesive population. Here we demonstrate that a proper degree of cell-cell adhesiveness can, intriguingly, enhance the super-diffusive nature of individual cells. We systematically characterize the migration trajectories of crawling MDA-MB-231 cell lines, while they are in several different clustering modes, including freely crawling singles, cohesive doublets of two cells, quadruplets, and confluent population on two-dimensional substrate. Following data analysis and computer simulation of a simple cellular Potts model, which faithfully recapitulated all key experimental observations such as enhanced diffusivity as well as periodic rotation of cell-doublets and cell-quadruplets with mixing events, we found that proper combination of active self-propelling force and cell-cell adhesion is sufficient for generating the observed phenomena. Additionally, we found that tuning parameters for these two factors covers a variety of different collective dynamic states.

                <p>by Elzbieta Rembeza, Martin K. M. Engqvist</p>

Only a small fraction of genes deposited to databases have been experimentally characterised. The majority of proteins have their function assigned automatically, which can result in erroneous annotations. The reliability of current annotations in public databases is largely unknown; experimental attempts to validate the accuracy within individual enzyme classes are lacking. In this study we performed an overview of functional annotations to the BRENDA enzyme database. We first applied a high-throughput experimental platform to verify functional annotations to an enzyme class of S-2-hydroxyacid oxidases (EC 1.1.3.15). We chose 122 representative sequences of the class and screened them for their predicted function. Based on the experimental results, predicted domain architecture and similarity to previously characterised S-2-hydroxyacid oxidases, we inferred that at least 78% of sequences in the enzyme class are misannotated. We experimentally confirmed four alternative activities among the misannotated sequences and showed that misannotation in the enzyme class increased over time. Finally, we performed a computational analysis of annotations to all enzyme classes in the BRENDA database, and showed that nearly 18% of all sequences are annotated to an enzyme class while sharing no similarity or domain architecture to experimentally characterised representatives. We showed that even well-studied enzyme classes of industrial relevance are affected by the problem of functional misannotation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Drug-induced resistance evolution necessitates less aggressive treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Teemu Kuosmanen, Johannes Cairns, Robert Noble, Niko Beerenwinkel, Tommi Mononen, Ville Mustonen</p>

Increasing body of experimental evidence suggests that anticancer and antimicrobial therapies may themselves promote the acquisition of drug resistance by increasing mutability. The successful control of evolving populations requires that such biological costs of control are identified, quantified and included to the evolutionarily informed treatment protocol. Here we identify, characterise and exploit a trade-off between decreasing the target population size and generating a surplus of treatment-induced rescue mutations. We show that the probability of cure is maximized at an intermediate dosage, below the drug concentration yielding maximal population decay, suggesting that treatment outcomes may in some cases be substantially improved by less aggressive treatment strategies. We also provide a general analytical relationship that implicitly links growth rate, pharmacodynamics and dose-dependent mutation rate to an optimal control law. Our results highlight the important, but often neglected, role of fundamental eco-evolutionary costs of control. These costs can often lead to situations, where decreasing the cumulative drug dosage may be preferable even when the objective of the treatment is elimination, and not containment. Taken together, our results thus add to the ongoing criticism of the standard practice of administering aggressive, high-dose therapies and motivate further experimental and clinical investigation of the mutagenicity and other hidden collateral costs of therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phenotypic-dependent variability and the emergence of tolerance in bacterial populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by José Camacho Mateu, Matteo Sireci, Miguel A. Muñoz</p>

Ecological and evolutionary dynamics have been historically regarded as unfolding at broadly separated timescales. However, these two types of processes are nowadays well-documented to intersperse much more tightly than traditionally assumed, especially in communities of microorganisms. Advancing the development of mathematical and computational approaches to shed novel light onto eco-evolutionary problems is a challenge of utmost relevance. With this motivation in mind, here we scrutinize recent experimental results showing evidence of rapid evolution of tolerance by lag in bacterial populations that are periodically exposed to antibiotic stress in laboratory conditions. In particular, the distribution of single-cell lag times—i.e., the times that individual bacteria from the community remain in a dormant state to cope with stress—evolves its average value to approximately fit the antibiotic-exposure time. Moreover, the distribution develops right-skewed heavy tails, revealing the presence of individuals with anomalously large lag times. Here, we develop a parsimonious individual-based model mimicking the actual demographic processes of the experimental setup. Individuals are characterized by a single phenotypic trait: their intrinsic lag time, which is transmitted with variation to the progeny. The model—in a version in which the amplitude of phenotypic variations grows with the parent’s lag time—is able to reproduce quite well the key empirical observations. Furthermore, we develop a general mathematical framework allowing us to describe with good accuracy the properties of the stochastic model by means of a macroscopic equation, which generalizes the Crow-Kimura equation in population genetics. Even if the model does not account for all the biological mechanisms (e.g., genetic changes) in a detailed way—i.e., it is a phenomenological one—it sheds light onto the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the problem and can be helpful to design strategies to hinder the emergence of tolerance in bacterial communities. From a broader perspective, this work represents a benchmark for the mathematical framework designed to tackle much more general eco-evolutionary problems, thus paving the road to further research avenues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A unified mechanism for innate and learned visual landmark guidance in the insect central complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roman Goulard, Cornelia Buehlmann, Jeremy E. Niven, Paul Graham, Barbara Webb</p>

Insects can navigate efficiently in both novel and familiar environments, and this requires flexiblity in how they are guided by sensory cues. A prominent landmark, for example, can elicit strong innate behaviours (attraction or menotaxis) but can also be used, after learning, as a specific directional cue as part of a navigation memory. However, the mechanisms that allow both pathways to co-exist, interact or override each other are largely unknown. Here we propose a model for the behavioural integration of innate and learned guidance based on the neuroanatomy of the central complex (CX), adapted to control landmark guided behaviours. We consider a reward signal provided either by an innate attraction to landmarks or a long-term visual memory in the mushroom bodies (MB) that modulates the formation of a local vector memory in the CX. Using an operant strategy for a simulated agent exploring a simple world containing a single visual cue, we show how the generated short-term memory can support both innate and learned steering behaviour. In addition, we show how this architecture is consistent with the observed effects of unilateral MB lesions in ants that cause a reversion to innate behaviour. We suggest the formation of a directional memory in the CX can be interpreted as transforming rewarding (positive or negative) sensory signals into a mapping of the environment that describes the geometrical attractiveness (or repulsion). We discuss how this scheme might represent an ideal way to combine multisensory information gathered during the exploration of an environment and support optimal cue integration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model of naturalistic decision making in preference tests</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Ksander, Donald B. Katz, Paul Miller</p>

Decisions as to whether to continue with an ongoing activity or to switch to an alternative are a constant in an animal’s natural world, and in particular underlie foraging behavior and performance in food preference tests. Stimuli experienced by the animal both impact the choice and are themselves impacted by the choice, in a dynamic back and forth. Here, we present model neural circuits, based on spiking neurons, in which the choice to switch away from ongoing behavior instantiates this back and forth, arising as a state transition in neural activity. We analyze two classes of circuit, which differ in whether state transitions result from a loss of hedonic input from the stimulus (an “entice to stay” model) or from aversive stimulus-input (a “repel to leave” model). In both classes of model, we find that the mean time spent sampling a stimulus decreases with increasing value of the alternative stimulus, a fact that we linked to the inclusion of depressing synapses in our model. The competitive interaction is much greater in “entice to stay” model networks, which has qualitative features of the marginal value theorem, and thereby provides a framework for optimal foraging behavior. We offer suggestions as to how our models could be discriminatively tested through the analysis of electrophysiological and behavioral data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Membrane-binding mechanism of the EEA1 FYVE domain revealed by multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andreas Haahr Larsen, Lilya Tata, Laura H. John, Mark S. P. Sansom</p>

Early Endosomal Antigen 1 (EEA1) is a key protein in endosomal trafficking and is implicated in both autoimmune and neurological diseases. The C-terminal FYVE domain of EEA1 binds endosomal membranes, which contain phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P). Although it is known that FYVE binds PI(3)P specifically, it has not previously been described of how FYVE attaches and binds to endosomal membranes. In this study, we employed both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine how FYVE binds to PI(3)P-containing membranes. CG-MD showed that the dominant membrane binding mode resembles the crystal structure of EEA1 FYVE domain in complex with inositol-1,3-diphospate (PDB ID 1JOC). FYVE, which is a homodimer, binds the membrane via a hinge mechanism, where the C-terminus of one monomer first attaches to the membrane, followed by the C-terminus of the other monomer. The estimated total binding energy is ~70 kJ/mol, of which 50–60 kJ/mol stems from specific PI(3)P-interactions. By AT-MD, we could partition the binding mode into two types: (i) adhesion by electrostatic FYVE-PI(3)P interaction, and (ii) insertion of amphipathic loops. The AT simulations also demonstrated flexibility within the FYVE homodimer between the C-terminal heads and coiled-coil stem. This leads to a dynamic model whereby the 200 nm long coiled coil attached to the FYVE domain dimer can amplify local hinge-bending motions such that the Rab5-binding domain at the other end of the coiled coil can explore an area of 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup> in the search for a second endosome with which to interact.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Local field potentials in a pre-motor region predict learned vocal sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daril E. Brown II, Jairo I. Chavez, Derek H. Nguyen, Adam Kadwory, Bradley Voytek, Ezequiel M. Arneodo, Timothy Q. Gentner, Vikash Gilja</p>

Neuronal activity within the premotor region HVC is tightly synchronized to, and crucial for, the articulate production of learned song in birds. Characterizations of this neural activity detail patterns of sequential bursting in small, carefully identified subsets of neurons in the HVC population. The dynamics of HVC are well described by these characterizations, but have not been verified beyond this scale of measurement. There is a rich history of using local field potentials (LFP) to extract information about behavior that extends beyond the contribution of individual cells. These signals have the advantage of being stable over longer periods of time, and they have been used to study and decode human speech and other complex motor behaviors. Here we characterize LFP signals presumptively from the HVC of freely behaving male zebra finches during song production to determine if population activity may yield similar insights into the mechanisms underlying complex motor-vocal behavior. Following an initial observation that structured changes in the LFP were distinct to all vocalizations during song, we show that it is possible to extract time-varying features from multiple frequency bands to decode the identity of specific vocalization elements (syllables) and to predict their temporal onsets within the motif. This demonstrates the utility of LFP for studying vocal behavior in songbirds. Surprisingly, the time frequency structure of HVC LFP is qualitatively similar to well-established oscillations found in both human and non-human mammalian motor areas. This physiological similarity, despite distinct anatomical structures, may give insight into common computational principles for learning and/or generating complex motor-vocal behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Leveraging vibration of effects analysis for robust discovery in observational biomedical data science</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Braden T. Tierney, Elizabeth Anderson, Yingxuan Tan, Kajal Claypool, Sivateja Tangirala, Aleksandar D. Kostic, Arjun K. Manrai, Chirag J. Patel</p>

Hypothesis generation in observational, biomedical data science often starts with computing an association or identifying the statistical relationship between a dependent and an independent variable. However, the outcome of this process depends fundamentally on modeling strategy, with differing strategies generating what can be called “vibration of effects” (VoE). VoE is defined by variation in associations that often lead to contradictory results. Here, we present a computational tool capable of modeling VoE in biomedical data by fitting millions of different models and comparing their output. We execute a VoE analysis on a series of widely reported associations (e.g., carrot intake and eyesight) with an extended additional focus on lifestyle exposures (e.g., physical activity) and components of the Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular health (e.g., blood pressure). We leveraged our tool for potential confounder identification, investigating what adjusting variables are responsible for conflicting models. We propose modeling VoE as a critical step in navigating discovery in observational data, discerning robust associations, and cataloging adjusting variables that impact model output.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Social foraging in vampire bats is predicted by long-term cooperative relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon P. Ripperger, Gerald G. Carter</p>

Stable social bonds in group-living animals can provide greater access to food. A striking example is that female vampire bats often regurgitate blood to socially bonded kin and nonkin that failed in their nightly hunt. Food-sharing relationships form via preferred associations and social grooming within roosts. However, it remains unclear whether these cooperative relationships extend beyond the roost. To evaluate if long-term cooperative relationships in vampire bats play a role in foraging, we tested if foraging encounters measured by proximity sensors could be explained by wild roosting proximity, kinship, or rates of co-feeding, social grooming, and food sharing during 21 months in captivity. We assessed evidence for 6 hypothetical scenarios of social foraging, ranging from individual to collective hunting. We found that closely bonded female vampire bats departed their roost separately, but often reunited far outside the roost. Repeating foraging encounters were predicted by within-roost association and histories of cooperation in captivity, even when accounting for kinship. Foraging bats demonstrated both affiliative and competitive interactions with different social calls linked to each interaction type. We suggest that social foraging could have implications for social evolution if “local” within-roost cooperation and “global” outside-roost competition enhances fitness interdependence between frequent roostmates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does standard cosmology really predict the cosmic microwave background? [version 6; peer review: 2 approved, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                In standard Big Bang cosmology, the universe expanded from a very dense, hot and opaque initial state. The light that was last scattered about 380,000 years later, when the universe had become transparent, has been redshifted and is now seen as thermal radiation with a temperature of 2.7 K, the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, since light escapes faster than matter can move, it is prudent to ask how we, made of matter from this very source, can still see the light. In order for this to be possible, the light must take a return path of the right length. A curved return path is possible in spatially closed, balloon-like models, but in standard cosmology, the universe is “flat” rather than balloon-like, and it lacks a boundary surface that might function as a reflector. Under these premises, radiation that once filled the universe homogeneously cannot do so permanently after expansion, and we cannot see the last scattering event. It is shown that the traditional calculation of the CMB temperature is inappropriate and that light emitted by any source inside the Big Bang universe earlier than half its “conformal age” can only become visible to us via a return path. Although often advanced as the best evidence for a hot Big Bang, the CMB actually tells against a formerly smaller universe and so do also distant galaxies.

                Background: Diarrhea diseases remain the leading cause of death among children under-five in lower and lower-middle-income countries. This study was conducted to investigate the factors related to diarrhea among children aged 12 to 35 months in Cambodia. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014 using a combination of household and children’s datasets. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the determinant factors of diarrhea. Results: The survey included 2,828 children aged 12 to 35 months. The prevalence of diarrhea in the last 2 weeks was 16.44% (95% CI: 14.72%-18.31%). Factors significantly associated with childhood diarrhea were: maternal unemployment (AOR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.14-1.78); the child being male (AOR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.02-1.53); the presence of unimproved toilet facilities (AOR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.05-1.31); and unhygienic disposal of children’s stools (AOR = 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64) when controlling for other covariates. Both maternal age (one year older; AOR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.78– 0.93) and child age (one month older; AOR = 0.86; 95%CI: 0.78-0.94) had significant negative associations with the occurrence of childhood diarrhea. Conclusion: Childhood diarrhea remains a public health concern in Cambodia. Intervention programs should focus on reducing diarrheal diseases by constructing improved toilet facilities and promoting behavior to improve hygiene, specifically targeting younger mothers.

                The Psilocybe genus is well known for the synthesis of valuable psychoactive compounds such as Psilocybin, Psilocin, Baeocystin and Aeruginascin. The ubiquity of Psilocybin synthesis in Psilocybe has been attributed to a horizontal gene transfer mechanism of a ~20Kb gene cassette. A recently published highly contiguous reference genome derived from long read single molecule sequencing has underscored interesting variation in this Psilocybin synthesis gene cassette. This reference genome has also enabled the shotgun sequencing of spores from many Psilocybe strains to better catalog the genomic diversity in the Psilocybin synthesis pathway. Here we present the de novo assembly of genomes of 81 Psilocybe genomes compared to the P.envy reference genome. Surprisingly, the genomes of Psilocybe galindoi, Psilocybe tampanensis and Psilocybe azurescens lack sequence coverage over the previously described Psilocybin synthesis pathway but do demonstrate amino acid sequence homology to an alternative pathway and may illuminate previously proposed convergent evolution of Psilocybin synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neuronal pericellular baskets: neurotransmitter convergence and regulation of network excitability</a></h4>

              
                A pericellular basket is a presynaptic configuration of numerous axonal boutons outlining a target neuron soma and its proximal dendrites. Recent studies show neurochemical diversity of pericellular baskets and suggest that neurotransmitter usage together with the dense, soma-proximal boutons may permit strong input effects on different timescales. Here we review the development, distribution, neurochemical phenotypes, and possible functions of pericellular baskets. As an example, we highlight pericellular baskets formed by projections of certain Pet1/Fev neurons of the serotonergic raphe nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrin α5β1 nano-presentation regulates collective keratinocyte migration independent of substrate rigidity</a></h4>

              
                Nanometer-scale properties of the extracellular matrix influence many biological processes, including cell motility. While much information is available for single-cell migration, to date, no knowledge exists on how the nanoscale presentation of extracellular matrix receptors influences collective cell migration. In wound healing, basal keratinocytes collectively migrate on a fibronectin-rich provisional basement membrane to re-epithelialize the injured skin. Among other receptors, the fibronectin receptor integrin α5β1 plays a pivotal role in this process. Using a highly specific integrin α5β1 peptidomimetic combined with nanopatterned hydrogels, we show that keratinocyte sheets regulate their migration ability at an optimal integrin α5β1 nanospacing. This efficiency relies on the effective propagation of stresses within the cell monolayer independent of substrate stiffness. For the first time, this work highlights the importance of extracellular matrix receptor nanoscale organization required for efficient tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Common host variation drives malaria parasite fitness in healthy human red cells</a></h4>

              
                The replication of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites within red blood cells (RBCs) causes severe disease in humans, especially in Africa. Deleterious alleles like hemoglobin S are well-known to confer strong resistance to malaria, but the effects of common RBC variation are largely undetermined. Here we collected fresh blood samples from 121 healthy donors, most with African ancestry, and performed exome sequencing, detailed RBC phenotyping, and parasite fitness assays. Over one third of healthy donors unknowingly carried alleles for G6PD deficiency or hemoglobinopathies, which were associated with characteristic RBC phenotypes. Among non-carriers alone, variation in RBC hydration, membrane deformability, and volume was strongly associated with <i>P. falciparum </i>growth rate. Common genetic variants in<i> PIEZO1</i>, <i>SPTA1/SPTB</i>, and several <i>P. falciparum</i> invasion receptors were also associated with parasite growth rate. Interestingly, we observed little or negative evidence for divergent selection on non-pathogenic RBC variation between Africans and Europeans. These findings suggest a model in which globally widespread variation in a moderate number of genes and phenotypes modulates <i>P. falciparum</i> fitness in RBCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiscale analysis reveals that diet-dependent midgut plasticity emerges from alterations in both stem cell niche coupling and enterocyte size</a></h4>

              
                The gut is the primary interface between an animal and food, but how it adapts to qualitative dietary variation is poorly defined. We find that the <i>Drosophila </i>midgut plastically resizes following changes in dietary composition. A panel of nutrients collectively promote gut growth, which sugar opposes. Diet influences absolute and relative levels of enterocyte loss and stem cell proliferation, which together determine cell numbers. Diet also influences enterocyte size. A high sugar diet inhibits translation and uncouples ISC proliferation from expression of niche-derived signals but, surprisingly, rescuing these effects genetically was not sufficient to modify diet's impact on midgut size. However, when stem cell proliferation was deficient, diet's impact on enterocyte size was enhanced, and reducing enterocyte-autonomous TOR signaling was sufficient to attenuate diet-dependent midgut resizing. These data clarify the complex relationships between nutrition, epithelial dynamics, and cell size, and reveal a new mode of plastic, diet-dependent organ resizing.

                Universities and research institutions have to assess individuals when making decisions about hiring, promotion and tenure, but there are concerns that such assessments are overly reliant on metrics and proxy measures of research quality that overlook important factors such as academic rigor, data sharing and mentoring. These concerns have led to calls for universities and institutions to reform the methods they use to assess research and researchers. Here we present a new tool called SPACE that has been designed to help universities and institutions implement such reforms. The tool focuses on five core capabilities and can be used by universities and institutions at all stages of reform process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Task-specific roles of local interneurons for inter- and intraglomerular signaling in the insect antennal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Local interneurons (LNs) mediate complex interactions within the antennal lobe, the primary olfactory system of insects, and the functional analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb. In the cockroach <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, as in other insects, several types of LNs with distinctive physiological and morphological properties can be defined. Here, we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of individual LNs to analyze the role of spiking and nonspiking LNs in inter- and intraglomerular signaling during olfactory information processing. Spiking GABAergic LNs reacted to odorant stimulation with a uniform rise in <i>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub></i> in the ramifications of all innervated glomeruli. In contrast, in nonspiking LNs, glomerular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were odorant specific and varied between glomeruli, resulting in distinct, glomerulus-specific tuning curves. The cell type-specific differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics support the idea that spiking LNs play a primary role in interglomerular signaling, while they assign nonspiking LNs an essential role in intraglomerular signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fluctuations in Neural Complexity During Wakefulness Relate To Conscious Level and Cognition</a></h4>

              
                There has been considerable recent progress in measuring conscious level using neural complexity measures. For instance, such measures can reliably distinguish healthy awake from asleep subjects and vegetative state patients. However, this line of research has never explored the dynamics of conscious level during normal wakefulness. Being able to capture meaningful differences in conscious level during wakefulness may provide a vital new insight into the nature of consciousness, by demonstrating what biological, behavioural and cognitive factors relate to such differences. Here we take advantage of a large MEG and fMRI dataset of healthy adults, to examine within-subject conscious level fluctuations during resting state and tasks, by using a range of complexity measures. We first establish the validity of this approach in both neuroimaging domains by relating neural complexity measures to pre-existing techniques for capturing transitions of consciousness from full wakefulness into drowsiness and the earliest stages of sleep, finding decreased complexity as participants become increasingly drowsy. We further demonstrate that neural complexity measures in both MEG and fMRI change both within and between tasks, and relate to performance on an executive task, with higher complexity associated with better performance and faster reaction times. This approach provides a powerful new route to further explore the cognitive and neural underpinnings of consciousness.

                Satellite glia are the major glial cells in sympathetic ganglia, enveloping neuronal cell bodies. Despite this intimate association, how satellite glia contribute to sympathetic functions remain unclear. Here, we show that satellite glia are critical for metabolism, survival, and activity of sympathetic neurons and modulate autonomic behaviors in mice. Adult ablation of satellite glia results in impaired mTOR signaling, soma atrophy, reduced noradrenergic enzymes, and loss of sympathetic neurons. However, persisting neurons have elevated activity, and satellite glia-ablated mice show increased pupil dilation and heart rate, indicative of enhanced sympathetic tone. Satellite glia-specific deletion of Kir4.1, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, largely recapitulates the cellular defects observed in glia-ablated mice, suggesting that satellite glia act in part via extracellular K+ buffering. These findings highlight neuron-satellite glia as functional units in regulating sympathetic output, with implications for disorders linked to sympathetic hyper-activity such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discoidin domain receptor regulates ensheathment, survival, and caliber of peripheral axons</a></h4>

              
                Invertebrate axons and small caliber axons in mammalian peripheral nerves are unmyelinated but still ensheathed by glia. How this type of ensheathment is controlled and its roles in supporting neuronal function remain unclear. We performed an in vivo RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify glial genes required for axon ensheathment and identified the conserved receptor tyrosine kinase Discoidin domain receptor (Ddr). In larval peripheral nerves, loss of Ddr resulted in incomplete ensheathment of axons. We found a strong dominant genetic interaction between Ddr and the fly type XV/XVIII collagen Multiplexin (Mp), suggesting Ddr functions a collagen receptor to drive wrapping of axons during development. Surprisingly, while ablation of glia that wrap axons severely impaired larval motor behavior, incomplete wrapping in Ddr mutants was sufficient to support basic circuit function. In adult nerves, loss of Ddr from glia decreased long-term survival of sensory neurons and significantly reduced axon caliber without overtly affecting ensheathment. Our data establish a crucial role for non-myelinating glia in peripheral nerve development and function across the lifespan, and identify Ddr as a key regulator of axon-glia interactions during ensheathment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysregulated coordination of MAPT exon 2 and exon 10 splicing underlies different tau pathologies in PSP and AD</a></h4>

              
                Understanding regulation of MAPT splicing is important to the etiology of many nerurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), in which different tau isoforms accumulate in pathologic inclusions. MAPT, the gene encoding the tau protein, undergoes complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing to generate six isoforms. Tauopathies can be categorized by the presence of tau aggregates containing either 3 (3R) or 4 (4R) microtubule binding domain repeats (determined by inclusion/exclusion of exon 10), but the role of the N terminal domain of the protein, determined by inclusion/exclusion of exons 2 and 3 has been less well studied. Using an unbiased correlational screen in human brain tissue, we observed coordination of MAPT exons 2 and 10 splicing. Expression of exon 2 splicing regulators and subsequently exon 2 inclusion are differentially disrupted in PSP and AD brain, resulting in the accumulation of 1N4R isoforms in PSP and 0N isoforms in AD temporal cortex. Furthermore, we identified different N-terminal isoforms of tau present in neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites and tufted astrocytes, indicating a role for differential N-terminal splicing in the development of disparate tau neuropathologies. We conclude that N-terminal splicing and combinatorial regulation with exon 10 inclusion/exclusion is likely to be important to our understanding of tauopathies.

                The lack of detailed insight into the structure of aggregates formed by the huntingtin protein has hampered efforts to develop therapeutics and diagnostics targeting pathology formation in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the structural properties of in vitro generated fibrils from exon1 of the huntingtin protein by electron cryo-microscopy and single- particle analysis. We show that wildtype and mutant exon1 of the huntingtin protein form non-helical fibrils with a polygultamine amyloid core composed of {beta}-hairpins with unique characteristics that have not been previously observed with other amyloid filaments. The stacks of {beta}-hairpins form long planar {beta}- sheets (protofilaments) with variable stacking angle and occasional out-of-register state of individual {beta}-hairpins. These features and the propensity of protofilament to undergo lateral association results in a high degree of fibril polymorphism, including fibrils composed of varying numbers of protofilaments. Our results also represent the first direct observation of how the flanking domains are organized around the polyglutamine core of the fibril and provide insight into how they might affect huntingtin fibril structure, polymorphism, and stacking of {beta}-hairpins within its core structure. Removal of the first 17 amino acids at the N-terminus resulted in surprising intra-fibril structural heterogeneity and reduced fibril's propensity to lateral associations. Overall, this work provides valuable insights that could guide future mechanistic studies to elucidate the sequence and structural determinants of huntingtin aggregation, as well as cryo- EM and structural studies of fibrils derived from huntingtin proteins and other disease-associated polyglutamine-containing proteins.

                Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor that is both a drug of abuse and an FDA-approved anesthetic used off-label for treatment-resistant depression. Despite its growing clinical use for depression and pain, the relationships between the acute dissociative and affective effects of ketamine that contribute to its abuse liability and therapeutic potential, along with the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, are not well established. To address this need, we have implemented a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, within-subjects mechanistic trial. Healthy adult subjects undergo infusion with two fixed doses of subanesthetic racemic intravenous (IV) ketamine and placebo and their acute responses are assessed with self-report questionnaires, behavioral measures, hormone levels, and neuroimaging. As planned in our analysis strategy, we present interim results for the first 7 subjects of our study, focusing on dissociative and affective states and resting functional brain coupling signatures of these states. The first key finding was that ketamine induced dose-dependent increases in dissociation and related intoxication. Ketamine also altered affective states, reducing emotional insensitivity but increasing stress assessed by cortisol. Second, ketamine had an effect on altering brain connectivity, particularly for specific connections between regions of the reward and negative affect circuits and involving thalamic sub-regions. Third, regarding brain-response associations, ketamine-induced increases in amygdala-anteroventral thalamus coupling were correlated with greater dissociation and intoxication, whereas decreases in the coupling of the anteromedial thalamus and posterior parietal thalamus were correlated with increased sensory aspects of reward responsiveness. Additional specific correlations were observed between affective measures relevant to reward responsiveness or its absence and drug-altered changes in localized functional connections involving the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and thalamic sub-regions. We also discovered a consistent profile of negative associations between ketamine altered connectivity involving the NAcc and specific thalamic sub-regions and effects of anxiety. Further, drug-altered increases in the coupling of the amygdala and anteroventral thalamus were associated with increases in cortisol, an indicator of biochemical stress. The findings highlight the utility of integrating self-reports, objective measures, and functional neuroimaging to disentangle the brain states underlying specific acute responses induced by ketamine. With the likely continued expansion of FDA indications for ketamine, understanding acute responses and underlying neural mechanisms is important for maximizing the therapeutic potential of ketamine while minimizing the risk of promoting misuse or abuse of this substance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotion Down- and Up-Regulation Act on Spatially Distinct Brain Areas:Interoceptive Regions to Calm Down and Other Affective Regions to Amp Up</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies on emotion regulation identified a set of brain regions specialized for generating and controlling affect. Researchers generally agree that when up- and down-regulating emotion, control regions in the prefrontal cortex turn up or down activity in affect-generating areas. However, the assumption that turning up and down emotions produces opposite effects in the same affect-generating regions is untested. We call this assumption the 'affective dial hypothesis.' Our study tested this hypothesis by examining the overlap between the sets of regions activated during up-regulation and those deactivated during down-regulation in a large number of participants (N=105). We found that up- and down-regulation both recruit regulatory regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus but act on distinct affect-generating regions. While up-regulation increases BOLD signal in regions associated with emotion such as the amygdala, anterior insula, striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in regions associated with sympathetic vascular activity such as periventricular white matter, down-regulation decreases signal in regions receiving interoceptive input such as the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus. These findings indicate that up- and down-regulation do not generally exert opposing effects on the same affect-generating regions. Instead, they target different brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of RALBP1 in Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of our study is to understand the role of the Ralbp1 gene in oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction and cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The Ralbp1 gene encodes the 76 kDa protein Rlip (aka RLIP76). Previous studies have revealed its role in OS-related cancer. However, Rlip is transcriptionally regulated by EP300, a CREB-binding protein that is important for synaptic plasticity in the brain. Rlip functions as a stress-responsive/protective transporter of glutathione conjugates (GS-E) and xenobiotic toxins. OS causes rapid cellular accumulation of Rlip and its translocation from a tubulin-bound complex to the plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, Rlip may play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in the face of OS-related injury. This study is aimed to determine whether Rlip deficiency in mice is associated with AD-like cognitive and mitochondrial dysfunction. Brain tissue obtained from cohorts of wildtype and Rlip+/- mice were analyzed for OS markers, expression of genes that regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion, and synaptic integrity. We also examined mitochondrial ultrastructure in mouse brains obtained from these mice and further analyzed the impact of Rlip deficiency on gene networks of AD, aging, inhibition of stress-activated gene expression, mitochondrial function, and CREB signaling. Our studies revealed a significant increase in the levels of OS markers and alterations in the expression of genes and proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and synapses in brain tissues of these mice. Furthermore, we compared the cognitive function of wildtype and Rlip+/- mice. Behavioral, basic motor and sensory function tests in Rlip+/- mice revealed cognitive decline, similar to AD. Gene network analysis indicated dysregulation of stress-activated gene expression, mitochondrial function, and CREB signaling genes in the Rlip+/- mouse liver. Our results suggest that the Rlip deficiency-associated increase in OS and mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to the development of OS-related AD processes. Therefore, the restoration of Rlip activity and endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms by pharmacological interventions is a novel approach to protect against AD.

                In the human visual system, cerebral cortex combines left- and right-eye retinal inputs, enabling single, comfortable binocular vision. In visual cortex, the signals from each eye inhibit one another (interocular suppression). While this mechanism may be disrupted by e.g. traumatic brain injury, clinical assessments of interocular suppression are subjective, qualitative, and lack reliability. EEG is a potentially useful clinical tool for objective, quantitative assessment of binocular vision. In a cohort of normal participants, we measured occipital, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to dichoptically-presented vertical and/or horizontal sine-wave gratings. Response amplitudes to orthogonal gratings were greater than that of parallel gratings, which were in turn greater than that of monocular gratings. Our results indicate that interocular suppression is (normally) balanced, orientation-tuned, and that suppression per se is reduced for orthogonal gratings. This objective measure of suppression may have application in clinical settings.

                Retinal degenerative diseases (RDD) such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) have no treatment. Stem cell-based therapies could provide promising opportunities to repair the damaged retina and restore vision. We investigated a novel approach in which human retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) derived from primitive mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs) were examined to treat retinal degeneration in an rd12 mouse model of RP. Intravitreally transplanted cells improved retinal function and significantly increased retinal thickness. Transplanted cells homed, survived, and integrated to various retinal layers. They also induced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses and upregulated neurogenesis genes. We found that RPCs were more efficacious than pMSCs in improving the retinal structure and function. RNA analyses suggest that RPCs promote neuroprotection and neuronal differentiation by activating JAK/STAT and MAPK, and inhibiting BMP signaling pathways. These promising results provide the basis for clinical studies to treat RDD using RPCs derived from pMSCs.

                In addition to its well-known contributions to motor control and motor learning, the cerebellum is involved in language, emotional regulation, anxiety, and affect1-4. We found that suppressing the firing of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) rapidly excites forebrain areas that could contribute to such functions, including the amygdala, basal forebrain, and septum, but that the classic cerebellar outputs, the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), do not project to these regions. Here we show that parabrachial nuclei (PBN) neurons that receive direct PC input, project to and influence all of these forebrain regions and many others. Furthermore, the function of this pathway is distinct from the canonical pathway: suppressing PC to PBN activity is aversive, whereas suppressing the PC to DCN pathway is rewarding. Therefore, the PBN pathway allows the cerebellum to influence the entire spectrum of valence, modulate the activity of forebrain regions known to regulate diverse nonmotor behaviors, and may be the substrate for many nonmotor disorders related to cerebellar dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning about threat from friends and strangers is equally effective: an fMRI study on observational fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Humans often benefit from social cues when learning about the world. For instance, learning about threats from others can save the individual from dangerous first-hand experiences. Familiarity is believed to increase the effectiveness of social learning, but it is not clear whether it plays a role in learning about threats. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we undertook a naturalistic approach and investigated whether there was a difference between observational fear learning from friends and strangers. Participants (observers) witnessed either their friends or strangers (demonstrators) receiving aversive (shock) stimuli paired with colored squares (observational learning stage). Subsequently, participants watched the same squares, but without receiving any shocks (direct-expression stage). We observed a similar pattern of brain activity in both groups of observers. Regions related to threat responses (amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex) and social perception (fusiform gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus) were activated during the observational phase, reflecting the fear contagion process. The anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex were also activated during the subsequent stage, indicating the expression of learned threat. Because there were no differences between participants observing friends and strangers, we argue that social threat learning is independent of the level of familiarity with the demonstrator.

                With smartphone-based mobile electroencephalography (EEG), we can investigate sound perception beyond the lab. To understand sound perception in the real world, we need to relate naturally occurring sounds to EEG data. For this, EEG and audio information need to be synchronized precisely, only then it is possible to capture fast and transient evoked neural responses and relate them to individual sounds. We have developed Android applications (AFEx and Record-a) that allow for the concurrent acquisition of EEG data and audio features, i.e., sound onsets, average signal power (RMS) and power spectral density (PSD) on smartphone. In this paper, we evaluate these apps by computing event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by everyday sounds. One participant listened to piano notes (played live by a pianist) and to a home-office soundscape. Timing tests showed that the temporal precision of the system is very good. We calculated ERPs to sound onsets and observed the typical P1-N1-P2 complex of auditory processing. Furthermore, we show how to relate information on loudness (RMS) and spectra (PSD) to brain activity. In future studies, we can use this system to study sound processing in everyday life.

                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows non-invasive stimulation of the cortex. In multi-locus TMS (mTMS), the stimulating electric field (E-field) is controlled electronically without coil movement by adjusting currents in the coils of a transducer. Objective: To develop an mTMS system that allows adjusting the location and orientation of the E-field maximum within a cortical region. Methods: We designed and manufactured a planar 5-coil mTMS transducer to allow controlling the maximum of the induced E-field within a cortical region approximately 30 mm in diameter. We developed electronics with a design consisting of independently controlled H-bridge circuits to drive up to six TMS coils. To control the hardware, we programmed software that runs on a field-programmable gate array and a computer. To induce the desired E-field in the cortex, we developed an optimization method to calculate the currents needed in the coils. We characterized the mTMS system and conducted a proof-of-concept motor-mapping experiment on a healthy volunteer. In the motor mapping, we kept the transducer placement fixed while electronically shifting the E-field maximum on the precentral gyrus and measuring electromyography from the contralateral hand. Results: The transducer consists of an oval coil, two figure-of-eight coils, and two four-leaf-clover coils stacked on top of each other. The technical characterization indicated that the mTMS system performs as designed. The measured motor evoked potential amplitudes varied consistently as a function of the location of the E-field maximum. Conclusion: The developed mTMS system enables electronically targeted brain stimulation within a cortical region.

                Quantifying the population sizes of distinct neuron types in different anatomical regions is an essential step towards establishing a brain cell census. Although estimates exist for the total neuronal populations in different species, the number and definition of each specific neuron type are still intensively investigated. Hippocampome.org is an open-source knowledge base with morphological, physiological, and molecular information for 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. While such framework identifies all known neuron types in this system, their relative abundances remain largely unknown. This work quantitatively estimates the counts of all Hippocampome.org neuron types by literature mining and numerical optimization. We report the number of neurons in each type identified by main neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA) and axonal-dendritic patterns throughout 26 subregions and layers of the dentate gyrus, Ammons horn, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. We produce by sensitivity analysis reliable numerical ranges for each type and summarize the amounts across broad neuronal families defined by biomarkers expression and firing dynamics. Study of density distributions indicates that the number of dendritic-targeting interneurons, but not of other neuronal classes, is independent of anatomical volumes. All extracted values, experimental evidence, and related software code are released on Hippocampome.org.

	<p>Introduction: Melanoma brain metastases remain a devastating disease process with poor prognosis. Recently, there has been a surge in studies demonstrating the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy for brain tumor treatment. Given their specificity and amenability to genetic modification, the authors explore the possible role of oncolytic virotherapy as a potential treatment option for patients with melanoma brain metastases. Methods: A comprehensive literature review including both preclinical and clinical evidence of oncolytic virotherapy for the treatment of melanoma brain metastasis was performed. Results: Oncolytic virotherapy, specifically T-VEC (Imlygic™), was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2015. Recent clinical trials demonstrate promising anti-tumor changes in patients who have received T-VEC; however, there is little evidence for its use in metastatic brain disease based on the existing literature. To date, only two single cases utilizing virotherapy in patients with metastatic brain melanoma have been reported, specifically in patients with treatment refractory disease. Currently, there is not sufficient data to support the use of T-VEC or other viruses for intracranial metastatic melanoma. In developing a virotherapy treatment paradigm for melanoma brain metastases, several factors must be considered, including route of administration, need to bypass the blood–brain barrier, viral tumor infectivity, and risk of adverse events. Conclusions: Evidence for oncolytic virotherapy treatment of melanoma is limited primarily to T-VEC, with a noticeable paucity of data in the literature with respect to brain tumor metastasis. Given the promising findings of virotherapy for other brain tumor types, oncolytic virotherapy has great potential to offer benefits to patients afflicted with melanoma brain metastases and warrants further investigation.</p>

	<p>Sleep is a universal, highly preserved process, essential for human and animal life, whose complete functions are yet to be unravelled. Familial recurrence is acknowledged for some sleep disorders, but definite data are lacking for many of them. Genetic studies on sleep disorders have progressed from twin and family studies to candidate gene approaches to culminate in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Several works disclosed that sleep-wake characteristics, in addition to electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, have a certain degree of heritability. Notwithstanding, it is rare for sleep disorders to be attributed to single gene defects because of the complexity of the brain network/pathways involved. Besides, the advancing insights in epigenetic gene-environment interactions add further complexity to understanding the genetic control of sleep and its disorders. This narrative review explores the current genetic knowledge in sleep disorders in children, following the International Classification of Sleep Disorders—Third Edition (ICSD-3) categorisation.</p>

	<p>Correct in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) helps to avoid administration of disease-modifying treatments in non-AD patients, and allows the possible use of such treatments in clinically atypical AD patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers offer a tool for AD diagnosis. A reduction in CSF β-amyloid (marker of amyloid plaque burden), although compatible with Alzheimer’s pathological change, may also be observed in other dementing disorders, including vascular cognitive disorders due to subcortical small-vessel disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Thus, for the diagnosis of AD, an abnormal result of CSF β-amyloid may not be sufficient, and an increase in phospho-tau (marker of tangle pathology) is also required in order to confirm AD diagnosis in patients with a typical amnestic presentation and reveal underlying AD in patients with atypical or mixed and diagnostically confusing clinical presentations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of BiP as a CB1 Receptor-Interacting Protein That Fine-Tunes Cannabinoid Signaling in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cannabinoids, the bioactive constituents of cannabis, exert a wide array of effects on the brain by engaging Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R). Accruing evidence supports that cannabinoid action relies on context-dependent factors, such as the biological characteristics of the target cell, suggesting that cell population-intrinsic molecular cues modulate CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-dependent signaling. Here, by using a yeast two-hybrid-based high-throughput screening, we identified BiP as a potential CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-interacting protein. We next found that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and BiP interact specifically <I>in vitro</I>, and mapped the interaction site within the CB<SUB>1</SUB>R <I>C</I>-terminal (intracellular) domain and the BiP <I>C</I>-terminal (substrate-binding) domain-&alpha;. BiP selectively shaped agonist-evoked CB<SUB>1</SUB>R signaling by blocking an "alternative" G<SUB>q/11</SUB> protein-dependent signaling module while leaving the "classical" G<SUB>i/o</SUB> protein-dependent inhibition of the cAMP pathway unaffected. <I>In situ</I> proximity ligation assays conducted on brain samples from various genetic mouse models of conditional loss or gain of CB<SUB>1</SUB>R expression allowed to map CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes selectively on terminals of GABAergic neurons. Behavioral studies using cannabinoid-treated male BiP<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice supported that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes modulate cannabinoid-evoked anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis. Together, by identifying BiP as a CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-interacting protein that controls receptor function in a signaling pathway- and neuron population-selective manner, our findings may help to understand the striking context-dependent actions of cannabis in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cannabis use is increasing worldwide, so innovative studies aimed to understand its complex mechanism of neurobiological action are warranted. Here, we found that cannabinoid CB<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R), the primary molecular target of the bioactive constituents of cannabis, interacts specifically with an intracellular protein called BiP. The interaction between CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and BiP occurs selectively on terminals of GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons, and induces a remarkable shift in the CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-associated signaling profile. Behavioral studies conducted in mice support that CB<SUB>1</SUB>R-BiP complexes act as fine-tuners of anxiety, one of the most frequent undesired effects of cannabis use. Our findings open a new conceptual framework to understand the striking context-dependent pharmacological actions of cannabis in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Subpopulation of Microglia Generated in the Adult Mouse Brain Originates from Prominin-1-Expressing Progenitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Microglia maintain brain health and play important roles in disease and injury. Despite the known ability of microglia to proliferate, the precise nature of the population or populations capable of generating new microglia in the adult brain remains controversial. We identified Prominin-1 (Prom1; also known as CD133) as a putative cell surface marker of committed brain myeloid progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Prom1-expressing cells isolated from mixed cortical cultures will generate new microglia <I>in vitro</I>. To determine whether Prom1-expressing cells generate new microglia <I>in vivo</I>, we used tamoxifen inducible fate mapping in male and female mice. Induction of Cre recombinase activity at 10 weeks in Prom1-expressing cells leads to the expression of TdTomato in all Prom1-expressing progenitors and newly generated daughter cells. We observed a population of new TdTomato-expressing microglia at 6 months of age that increased in size at 9 months. When microglia proliferation was induced using a transient ischemia/reperfusion paradigm, little proliferation from the Prom1-expressing progenitors was observed with the majority of new microglia derived from Prom1-negative cells. Together, these findings reveal that Prom1-expressing myeloid progenitor cells contribute to the generation of new microglia both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate the existence of an undifferentiated myeloid progenitor population in the adult mouse brain that expresses Prom1. We conclude that Prom1-expressing myeloid progenitors contribute to new microglia genesis in the uninjured brain but not in response to ischemia/reperfusion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, can divide to slowly generate new microglia throughout life. Newly generated microglia may influence inflammatory responses to injury or neurodegeneration. However, the origins of the new microglia in the brain have been controversial. Our research demonstrates that some newly born microglia in a healthy brain are derived from cells that express the stem cell marker Prominin-1. This is the first time Prominin-1 cells are shown to generate microglia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oligodendrocyte HCN2 Channels Regulate Myelin Sheath Length</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oligodendrocytes generate myelin sheaths vital for the formation, health, and function of the CNS. Myelin sheath length is a key property that determines axonal conduction velocity and is known to be variable across the CNS. Myelin sheath length can be modified by neuronal activity, suggesting that dynamic regulation of sheath length might contribute to the functional plasticity of neural circuits. Although the mechanisms that establish and refine myelin sheath length are important determinants of brain function, our understanding of these remains limited. In recent years, the membranes of myelin sheaths have been increasingly recognized to contain ion channels and transporters that are associated with specific important oligodendrocyte functions, including metabolic support of axons and the regulation of ion homeostasis, but none have been shown to influence sheath architecture. In this study, we determined that hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, typically associated with neuronal and cardiac excitability, regulate myelin sheath length. Using both <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> approaches, we show that oligodendrocytes abundantly express functional, predominantly HCN2 subunit-containing ion channels. These HCN ion channels retain key pharmacological and biophysical features and regulate the resting membrane potential of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Further, reduction of their function via pharmacological blockade or generation of transgenic mice with two independent oligodendrocyte-specific HCN2 knock-out strategies reduced myelin sheath length. We conclude that HCN2 ion channels are key determinants of myelin sheath length in the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin sheath length is a critical determinant of axonal conduction velocity, but the signaling mechanisms responsible for determining sheath length are poorly understood. Here we find that oligodendrocytes express functional hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated 2 (HCN2) ion channels that regulate the length of myelin sheaths formed by oligodendrocytes in myelinating cultures and in the mouse brain and spinal cord. These results suggest that the regulation of HCN2 channel activity is well placed to refine sheath length and conduction along myelinated axons, providing a potential mechanism for alterations in conduction velocity and circuit function in response to axonal signals such as those generated by increased activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{mu}-Opioid Receptor (Oprm1) Copy Number Influences Nucleus Accumbens Microcircuitry and Reciprocal Social Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The &mu;-opioid receptor regulates reward derived from both drug use and natural experiences, including social interaction, through actions in the nucleus accumbens. Here, we studied nucleus accumbens microcircuitry and social behavior in male and female mice with heterozygous genetic knockout of the &mu;-opioid receptor (Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). This genetic condition models the partial reduction of &mu;-opioid receptor signaling reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders. We first analyzed inhibitory synapses in the nucleus accumbens, using methods that differentiate between medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. Inhibitory synaptic transmission was increased in D2-MSNs of male mutants, but not female mutants, while the expression of gephyrin mRNA and the density of inhibitory synaptic puncta at the cell body of D2-MSNs was increased in mutants of both sexes. Some of these changes were more robust in Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mutants than Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants, demonstrating that partial reductions of &mu;-opioid signaling can have large effects. At the behavioral level, social conditioned place preference and reciprocal social interaction were diminished in Oprm1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> and Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants of both sexes. Interaction with Oprm1 mutants also altered the social behavior of wild-type test partners. We corroborated this latter result using a social preference task, in which wild-type mice preferred interactions with another typical mouse over Oprm1 mutants. Surprisingly, Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice preferred interactions with other Oprm1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mutants, although these interactions did not produce a conditioned place preference. Our results support a role for partial dysregulation of &mu;-opioid signaling in social deficits associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activation of the &mu;-opioid receptor plays a key role in the expression of normal social behaviors. In this study, we examined brain function and social behavior of female and male mice, with either partial or complete genetic deletion of &mu;-opioid receptor expression. We observed abnormal social behavior following both genetic manipulations, as well as changes in the structure and function of synaptic input to a specific population of neurons in the nucleus accumbens, which is an important brain region for social behavior. Synaptic changes were most robust when &mu;-opioid receptor expression was only partially lost, indicating that small reductions in &mu;-opioid receptor signaling can have a large impact on brain function and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Multimodal Neural Transmission Suggests That Adult Spinal Networks Maintain an Intrinsic State of Readiness to Execute Sensorimotor Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spontaneous action potential discharge (spAP) is both ubiquitous and functionally relevant during neural development. spAP remains a prominent feature of supraspinal networks in maturity, even during unconsciousness. Evidence suggests that spAP persists in mature spinal networks during wakefulness, and one function of spAP in this context could be maintenance of a "ready state" to execute behaviors. The extent to which spAP persists in mature spinal networks during unconsciousness remains unclear, and its function(s), if any, are likewise unresolved. Here, we attempt to reconcile some of the questions and contradictions that emerge from the disintegrated picture of adult spinal spAP currently available. We recorded simultaneously from large populations of spinal interneurons <I>in vivo</I> in male rats, characterizing the spatial distribution of spAP in the lumbar enlargement and identifying subgroups of spontaneously active neurons. We find (1) concurrent spAP throughout the dorsoventral extent of the gray matter, with a diverse yet strikingly consistent mixture of neuron types across laminae; (2) the proportion of neurons exhibiting spAP in deeper, sensorimotor integrative regions is comparable to that in more superficial, sensory-dominant regions; (3) firing rate, but not spike train variability, varies systematically with region; and (4) spAP includes multimodal neural transmission consistent with executing a spinally-mediated behavior. These findings suggest that adult spAP may continue to support a state of readiness to execute sensorimotor behaviors even during unconsciousness. Such functionality has implications for our understanding of how perception is translated into action, of experience-dependent modification of behavior, and (mal)adaptative responses to injury or disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons often discharge action potentials (APs) seemingly spontaneously, that is, in the absence of ongoing behaviors or overt stimuli. This phenomenon is particularly evident during neural development, where spontaneous AP discharge (spAP) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system and is crucial to establishing connectivity among functionally related groups of neurons. The function(s) of spAP in adult spinal networks, if any, have remained enigmatic, especially during unconsciousness. Here, we report evidence that one such function could be to support an intrinsic state of readiness to execute sensorimotor behaviors. This finding has implications for our understanding of how perception is translated into action, of experience-dependent modification of behavior, and (mal)adaptative responses to injury or disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency Selectivity of Persistent Cortical Oscillatory Responses to Auditory Rhythmic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical oscillations have been proposed to play a functional role in speech and music perception, attentional selection, and working memory, via the mechanism of neural entrainment. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. We tested the existence of this phenomenon by studying cortical neural oscillations during and after presentation of melodic stimuli in a passive perception paradigm. Melodies were composed of ~60 and ~80 Hz tones embedded in a 2.5 Hz stream. Using intracranial and surface recordings in male and female humans, we reveal persistent oscillatory activity in the high- band in response to the tones throughout the cortex, well beyond auditory regions. By contrast, in response to the 2.5 Hz stream, no persistent activity in any frequency band was observed. We further show that our data are well captured by a model of damped harmonic oscillator and can be classified into three classes of neural dynamics, with distinct damping properties and eigenfrequencies. This model provides a mechanistic and quantitative explanation of the frequency selectivity of auditory neural entrainment in the human cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been proposed that the functional role of cortical oscillations is subtended by a mechanism of entrainment, the synchronization in phase or amplitude of neural oscillations to a periodic stimulation. One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. Using intracranial and surface recordings of humans passively listening to rhythmic auditory stimuli, we reveal consistent oscillatory responses throughout the cortex, with persistent activity of high- oscillations. On the contrary, neural oscillations do not outlast low-frequency acoustic dynamics. We interpret our results as reflecting harmonic oscillator properties, a model ubiquitous in physics but rarely used in neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">History Modulates Early Sensory Processing of Salient Distractors</a></h4>

              
                <p>To find important objects, we must focus on our goals, ignore distractions, and take our changing environment into account. This is formalized in models of visual search whereby goal-driven, stimulus-driven, and history-driven factors are integrated into a priority map that guides attention. Stimulus history robustly influences where attention is allocated even when the physical stimulus is the same: when a salient distractor is repeated over time, it captures attention less effectively. A key open question is how we come to ignore salient distractors when they are repeated. Goal-driven accounts propose that we use an active, expectation-driven mechanism to attenuate the distractor signal (e.g., predictive coding), whereas stimulus-driven accounts propose that the distractor signal is attenuated because of passive changes to neural activity and inter-item competition (e.g., adaptation). To test these competing accounts, we measured item-specific fMRI responses in human visual cortex during a visual search task where trial history was manipulated (colors unpredictably switched or were repeated). Consistent with a stimulus-driven account of history-based distractor suppression, we found that repeated singleton distractors were suppressed starting in V1, and distractor suppression did not increase in later visual areas. In contrast, we observed signatures of goal-driven target enhancement that were absent in V1, increased across visual areas, and were not modulated by stimulus history. Our data suggest that stimulus history does not alter goal-driven expectations, but rather modulates canonically stimulus-driven sensory responses to contribute to a temporally integrated representation of priority.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual search refers to our ability to find what we are looking for in a cluttered visual world (e.g., finding your keys). To perform visual search, we must integrate information about our goals (e.g., "find the red keychain"), the environment (e.g., salient items capture your attention), and changes to the environment (i.e., stimulus history). Although stimulus history impacts behavior, the neural mechanisms that mediate history-driven effects remain debated. Here, we leveraged fMRI and multivariate analysis techniques to measure history-driven changes to the neural representation of items during visual search. We found that stimulus history influenced the representation of a salient "pop-out" distractor starting in V1, suggesting that stimulus history operates via modulations of early sensory processing rather than goal-driven expectations.</p>
