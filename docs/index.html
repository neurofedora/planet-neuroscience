                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

">Direct imaging of neural activity reveals neural circuits via spatiotemporal activation mapping</a></h4>

              
                Two years ago, our group reported direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA), a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique that directly detects neuronal activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, we successfully reproduced the DIANA response in medetomidine-anesthetized mice using forelimb electrical stimulation at 11.7 T. More importantly, we showed that multiple neural circuits can be effectively revealed by DIANA fMRI through spatiotemporal activation mapping. The spatiotemporal activation mapping proposed here utilizes the temporal information of the DIANA response, that is, the time when the DIANA response reaches its peak, which is a unique feature that distinguishes it from the activation mapping method used in existing fMRI. Based on DIANA activation areas, we identified several neural circuits involved in forelimb sensory processing in the somatosensory network, which includes multiple brain regions: ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL), posteromedial thalamic nucleus (POm), forelimb primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), primary motor cortex (M1), and secondary motor cortex (M2). Additionally, we also identified a pain-related neural circuit involving brain regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Interestingly, the spatiotemporal activation mapping also allowed us to identify subregions with different DIANA response times within the same functional region (e.g., VPL, POm, S1FL, and S2). Our study highlights the potential of DIANA fMRI to advance our understanding of sensory information processing throughout the brain and to provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks at the level of neural circuits.

">Spatial 3D genome organization controls the activity of bivalent chromatin during human neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear genome is spatially organized into a three-dimensional (3D) architecture by physical association of large chromosomal domains with subnuclear compartments including the nuclear lamina at the radial periphery and nuclear speckles within the nucleoplasm. However, how spatial genome architecture regulates human brain development has been overlooked owing to technical limitations. Here, we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the lamina and speckles in cells of the neurogenic lineage isolated from midgestational human cortex, uncovering an intimate association between subnuclear genome compartmentalization, chromatin state and transcription. During cortical neurogenesis, spatial genome organization is extensively remodeled, relocating hundreds of neuronal genes from the lamina to speckles including key neurodevelopmental genes bivalent for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. At the lamina, bivalent genes have exceptionally low expression, and relocation to speckles enhances resolution of bivalent chromatin to H3K4me3 and increases transcription >7-fold. We further demonstrate that proximity to the nuclear periphery - not the presence of H3K27me3 - is the dominant factor in maintaining the lowly expressed, poised state of bivalent genes embedded in the lamina. In addition to uncovering a critical role of subnuclear genome compartmentalization in neurogenic transcriptional regulation, our results establish a new paradigm in which knowing the spatial location of a gene is necessary to understanding its epigenomic regulation.

	<p>Incidental visuospatial learning acquired under incidental conditions is more vulnerable to aging than in the intentional case. The theta and gamma correlates of the coding and retrieval of episodic memory change during aging. Based on the vulnerability of incidental coding to aging, different theta and gamma correlates could occur under the incidental versus intentional coding and retrieval of visuospatial information. Theta and gamma EEG was recorded from the frontotemporal regions, and incidental/intentional visuospatial learning was evaluated in young (25&amp;amp;ndash;60 years old) and elderly (60&amp;amp;ndash;85 years old) participants. The EEG recorded during encoding and retrieval was compared between incidental low-demand, incidental high-demand, and intentional conditions through an ANCOVA considering the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s gender, IQ, and years of schooling as covariates. Older adults exhibited worse performances, especially in place&amp;amp;ndash;object associations. After the intentional study, older participants showed a further increase in false-positive errors. Higher power at the theta and gamma bands was observed for frontotemporal derivations in older participants for both encoding and retrieval. Under retrieval, only young participants had lower power in terms of errors compared with correct responses. In conclusion, the different patterns of power and coherence support incidental and intentional visuospatial encoding and retrieval in young and elderly individuals. The correlates of power with behavior are sensitive to age and performance.</p>

                <p>Language is an evolutionarily salient faculty for humans that relies on a distributed brain network spanning across frontal, temporal, parietal, and subcortical regions. To understand whether the complex language network shares common or distinct genetic mechanisms, we examined the relationships between the genetic effects underlying the brain responses to language and a set of object domains that have been suggested to coevolve with language: tools, faces (indicating social), and body parts (indicating social and gesturing). Analyzing the twin datasets released by the Human Connectome Project that had functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human twin subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic) undergoing language and working memory tasks contrasting multiple object domains (198 females and 144 males for the language task; 192 females and 142 males for the working memory task), we identified a set of cortical regions in the frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions whose activity to language was significantly genetically influenced. The heterogeneity of the genetic effects among these language clusters was corroborated by significant differences of the human gene expression profiles (Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset). Among them, the bilateral basal ganglia (mainly dorsal caudate) exhibited a common genetic basis for language, tool, and body part processing, and the right superior temporal gyrus exhibited a common genetic basis for language and tool processing across multiple types of analyses. These results uncovered the heterogeneous genetic patterns of language neural processes, shedding light on the evolution of language and its shared origins with tools and bodily functions.</p>

                Background The global construction industry causes considerable stress to workers, affecting them physically and mentally. Stress, a reaction to difficult situations, can cause negative health effects. The demanding environment of a construction site increases stress, which leads to psychological, physical, and behavioral reactions. Traditional treatments often have side effects and social stigma. Hydrotherapy, which uses water for healing, offers a promising alternative that promotes relaxation and detoxification. Its multiple benefits make it a valuable stress management tool. This scoping review aims to critically analyze existing interventions on physiological well-being popular in the construction industry and to investigate the biological responses of hydrotherapy to stress markers. Finally, make recommendations that support the health of construction industry workers. Methods An evaluation funneled by the Arksey and O’Malley framework, improvements plus suggestions by Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien, Daudt et al., with the 2015 Johanna Briggs Institute guidelines will be performed. Organized electronic explorations of records and search engines including Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Google Scholar, plus IEEE Xplore will be conducted to retrieve distributed peer-reviewed articles from all research projects, excluding reviews and gray published works. All literature, research questions and sub-questions meeting the inclusion criteria will be integrated in this evaluation. All searched literature is transferred to the Endnote 21 library. The quality evaluation of the involved papers will be achieved by applying the MMAT 2018 version. Discussion We envision charting applicable sources on stress, researching the efficacy of treatment alternatives for stress as well as assessing their correlation with quality of life in construction workers. This study is expected to expose research gaps, which could guide future accomplishment research on stress treatment mediations.

                Background Academic achievement is the result of both effort and perseverance exerted by the students. This mixed-methods study aims to investigate the factors affecting the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-867/v1?src=rss">More foreign-accented but more comprehensible: Attrition and amelioration of L1 speech in proficient L2 learners [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background There is an increasing interest in cross-linguistic influences of the second language (L2) on the first (L1), but its communicative impact remains to be elucidated. This study investigates how L2 learners’ L1 pronunciation is perceived as foreign-accented and (in) comprehensible as a function of their L2 learning experience and proficiency levels. Methods Read speech of 154 L1 Japanese learners of L2 English in the J-AESOP corpus was examined, where approximately one-third of them had lived in English-speaking countries and the rest had never lived outside of Japan. Their L1 speech was rated by another group of native Japanese listeners for accentedness and comprehensibility (from October 25, 2022 to August 20, 2023), while their L2 speech was previously rated by native American English listeners for nativelikeness or proficiency. The speakers’ vowel acoustics were also examined. Results More proficient L2 speakers were perceived as more foreign-accented in their L1, but only if they had lived overseas; their length of residence abroad predicted the degree of perceived accentedness. In contrast, more proficient L2 speakers were consistently perceived as more comprehensible in the L1, regardless of prior overseas experience. Acoustic analyses indicated that perceived accentedness is associated with a clockwise chain shift of all vowel categories in the vowel space. It was also revealed that the dispersion, rather than compactness, of vowel production contributed to perceived comprehensibility, although the degree of L1 vowel dispersion did not predict L2 proficiency. Conclusions The overall results suggest two main conclusions. First, perceptible L1 foreign accent likely results from L1 disuse rather than L2 interference, thereby L1 pronunciation differs from native norms at a system-wide rather than category-specific level. Second, L2 learning has a positive influence on perceived L1 comprehensibility, rather than individuals with clearer and more comprehensible L1 speech being inherently better L2 learners.

                Background Music, a profound human expression, can have physical implications for its practitioners. Musicians face various physical challenges that can impact their well-being, with craniofacial and temporomandibular pain being prevalent yet understudied. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) affects up to one-third of the population, though prevalence varies by study. While musculoskeletal issues like carpal tunnel syndrome are well-documented in musicians, craniofacial and temporomandibular pain is less explored. This study aims to determine the differences in TMJD frequency among music students of different instrumental specialties. Methods The sample was composed of students between 12 and 25 years of age from the National University of Music of Peru. A stratified random probability sample was chosen. Data were collected using a structured instrument covering general data, academic information, dental malocclusion, the Fonseca Simplified Anamnestic Index, and the Global Stress Perception Scale. Statistical analysis included Pearson's Chi-square test and a generalized linear model regression. Results The sample included 71.4% males with a median age of 23 years. Class II dental occlusion was most common (51.4%). TMJD prevalence was: 14.3% no TMJD, 60.0% mild TMJD, 22.9% moderate TMJD, and 2.9% severe TMJD. Metal wind (PR=0.04, 95%CI [0.00; 50.04], p=0.002) and woodwind players (PR=0.03, 95%CI [0.00; 0.56], p=0.018) had lower TMJD prevalence compared to plucked string and percussion players. Post-regression analysis indicated significant differences between metal wind and percussion students (p=0.030) and between percussion and woodwind students (p=0.025). These results are supported by the adjusted ratio of proportions analysis, which maintains statistical significance. Conclusion We found significant differences in TMJD prevalence among music students based on their instrumental specialty, with lower rates in metal wind and woodwind players compared to plucked string and percussion players.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                Background Pragmatic language assessment in children is performed in line with standard protocols, guidelines, and best practices. The absence of these aspects in the Indian context has resulted in the quest to explore the approaches used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess pragmatic language impairments. This survey explored the current practices of SLPs towards the assessment of pragmatic language among preschool children in India. It also aimed to identify the barriers, facilitators and identify the level of knowledge, skill and overall practice of SLPs towards their practices using self-appraisal. Methods A total of 100 SLPs(94 females and 6 males) working with preschool aged children (three-to-six-year-olds) from across different Indian states participated in the survey. Participants were enquired about the aspects of pragmatic language assessed, methods used for assessment, awareness and use of Indian tools, the settings, members, and language used for the assessment. Additionally, they were asked to mention the specific tools used, informal methods used, barriers and facilitators, and self-appraise their knowledge, skill and overall practice. Results Majority of participants assessed multiple aspects of pragmatic language. All used a combination of different assessment methods, with the participants commonly using informal compared to formal approaches. Preschoolers were assessed at multiple settings, along with different communication partners. Lack of awareness on assessment tools developed in India was the major barrier, while the use of informal tasks or activities were the major facilitators influencing pragmatic language assessment to a greater extent. The knowledge and skills for the assessment of pragmatic language obtained poorer scores compared to practices. Conclusions The assessment practices of the SLPs were largely influenced by the unavailability of developed or adapted tools for Indian preschoolers, leading to the need to develop indigenous assessment tools. Certain considerations for further assessment practices have been identified and discussed.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

                Patients with hepatitis C share a variety of anemia, including bleeding, nutritional deficiencies, and anemia of chronic disease. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is usually reported with interferon-alpha and/or ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We report an unusual case of AIHA occurring in a49-year-old patient with untreated hepatitis C infection who presented with functional anemia syndrome. Monospecific direct antiglobulin test showed the presence of anti-complement (C3d++). Cold agglutinin titer was 1/16 at 4°C. The patient improved following blood transfusion, steroid therapy and direct acting antivirals.

                Background Excessive smartphone use has become a growing public health concern, especially among young people. Previous studies have suggested a possible relationship between excessive smartphone use and bruxism. However, the evidence on this relationship is still limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the relationship between smartphone dependence and addiction and bruxism in “NEET” (not in education, employment or training) young people in two coastal cities in Peru: Piura and Chincha. Methods A cross-sectional, correlational, and exploratory study was conducted. The sample consisted of 195 "NEETs" young people who attended to dental office. Two data collection instruments were used: the Smartphone Dependence and Addiction Scale (EDAS-18) and the self-reported bruxism questionnaire (CBA). The Chi2 Pearson test was used to analyze the association between the variables. Results In Piura, a significant association was found between smartphone dependence or addiction and bruxism (49.3% of young people with smartphone dependence or addiction had bruxism, p-value = 0.003). However, in Chincha this relationship was not significant. In the latter city, bruxism showed a significant association with gender (men had a higher prevalence of bruxism, p-value = 0.034), but not with smartphone dependence or addiction (p-value = 0.171). In Piura, the proportion of bruxism was 3.77 times higher in those with smartphone dependence or addiction in the simple model (p-value = 0.004), and 5.38 times higher in the adjusted model (p-value = 0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the regional variability in the relationship between smartphone use and bruxism among “NEETs” young people. A significant association is evident in Piura but not in Chincha, which underscores the need for context-adapted interventions to address the effects of excessive technology use on oral health.

                Background Heat induced by thermogenesis is an essential therapeutic intervention in medical practice. Moreover, thermogenesis improves the innate immune response. This study focuses on hand-clasping with a raised thumb (HCRT) as a thermogenic source and its effect on heart rate variability (HRV). Methods The study analyzed the ECG, thermal images of the upper body, axillary temperature, and breath exergy of 15 participants. The metabolic effect of thermogenesis is an important factor in type II diabetes mellitus (type II DM). Therefore, the clinical application included recording capillary blood glucose of 12 type-II DM subjects before and after the HCRT intervention. Results The mean axillary temperature slope increased by 11.5 %. The spatial change in temperature gradient (∇2T) at hot and cold spots also slightly increased by 3.42 % and 2.53 %, respectively. HRV improved as the VLFHF ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 52.62 %. The very low frequency (VLF) component of HRV has a relationship to thermoregulation, which is reflected through a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 41.7 % for the power under sub-VLF at 0.0327-0.04 Hz during HCRT. The spot width (SW), range, and norm of ∇2T reduces insignificantly during HCRT. There was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in the exhaled temperature by 0.5 ° C in both nostrils during 1st phase of HCRT. The standard deviation of exergy in the right nostril showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 72.72 % during HCRT. The Clinical tests showed a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of 24.14 % in capillary blood glucose (CBG) after HCRT. Conclusions HCRT aids in thermogenesis with higher exergy and HRV owing to a significant reduction in the VLFHF ratio.

                Background Determine the effects of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention on physical activity (PA), BMI and health-related quality of life (QoL) in obese and overweight adolescents. Methods Nine schools in India were clustered randomly in a 12-month study with students allocated to a multifactorial intervention (MFI), or exercise only (EX) or control (CON) group. Participants were adolescents aged 11-16 years (n=671). In the MFI group, adolescents and their parents received lifestyle education using a validated booklet combined with a PA intervention for school students. The EX group received school-based PA only; the CON group continued regular activities. Primary outcomes were PA levels measured with the PAQ-A, and BMI; the secondary outcome was health-related QoL. A linear regression statistical model was used to analyse time, group effects and interactions, with Bonferroni correction for within-group differences at baseline (T0) and at 12-weeks (T1) (post-intervention), 6-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Results Significant time and group effects observed for all groups with PA scores (p<0.001), with MFI group having largest increase in PA; with BMI (p<0.001) and MFI showing the least gain in BMI; and HRQOL (p<0.001), with MFI group showing greatest improvement in scores. There were significant increases in PA at T1 and T3 time-points with the EX group, and at T3 time-point only for MFI and CON, with MFI group showing largest increase in HRQOL scores. BMI increased significantly for all groups at T2 (MFI p=0.001, EX p<0.001) and T3 (p<0.001), while HRQOL increased significantly for both MFI and EX at both follow-ups (p<0.001). Conclusions School-based lifestyle MFI was more effective for improving PA, lifestyle behaviours and HRQOL than exercise alone for adolescents, although BMI was not reduced. MFI with PA could be an effective school-based approach for behaviour modification but BMI has limitations for measuring body composition changes.

                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Suis hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are aquatic sessile metazoans found worldwide in marine and freshwater environments. They are significant in the animal tree of life as one of the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and as filter feeders play crucial ecological roles, particularly in coral reefs, but are susceptible to the effects of climate change. In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, genomic data is crucial for species conservation efforts and predicting their evolutionary potential in response to environmental changes. However, there is a limited availability of culturable sponge species with annotated high-quality genomes to further comprehensive insights into animal evolution, function, and their response to the ongoing global change. Despite the publication of a few high-quality annotated sponge genomes, there remains a gap in resources for culturable sponge species. To address this gap, we provide high quality draft genomes of the two congeneric aquarium species Tethya wilhelma and Tethya minuta, small ball-shaped demosponges that are easily maintained long-term in ex situ culture. As such, they offer promising opportunities as laboratory models to contribute to advancing our understanding of sponge biology and provide valuable resources for studying animal evolution, function, and responses to environmental challenges.

                Purpose: This study aims to survey the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons in an economically developed region and to investigate their continuing training needs in contents, training methods, and barriers in private and government hospitals.   Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire was conducted from January to December, 2022 in Guangdong, China. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants to gain insights on the current demographic status. Demographic data and training needs assessment were collected and compared with the chi-square test, Fisher’s test, Mann-Whitney U-test using R software. Results: The disparity of surgeons’ demographic data between private and government hospitals was small. Over 60% of practicing aesthetic plastic surgeons transferred from other specialties, and one third of them had less than three years of working experience. Half of surgeons attended training less than three times with an affordable expense of 1000-5000RMB. Almost 80% of them had strong willingness to attend a continuing training program. They prefer to attend further study in a tertiary hospital, with a short topic-focused training course and operation demonstrations. Their favorable training contents were rhinoplasty, eye surgery, and new technologies. Our questionnaire survey revealed the likelihood that the surgeons had a graduate degree in government hospitals outweighed those in private hospitals (P<0.05). Results also showed that the government hospitals focused more on repair and reconstructive surgery and academic research, whereas, private hospitals focused on market needs and were more profit-driven, where the organizational needs had influence on their different training needs for aesthetic plastic surgeons. Conclusion: It would be favorable to take the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons and organizational needs into consideration in designing a continuing training program in plastic surgery.

                Background Socket preservation is a surgical procedure aimed at preserving the dimensions of the alveolar bone following tooth extraction. It is performed by filling the extraction socket with bone graft material with or without a barrier membrane. Recently, dentine obtained from extracted teeth has been tried as an autograft for socket preservation. Studies have compared the use of dentin to other bone grafts, however, systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of dentin for socket preservation are limited. Hence, this systematic review protocol is proposed to generate evidence on the efficacy of dentin as a viable alternative to other bone graft materials for socket preservation. Methods This systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Methodological Expectations of the Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) guidelines. It will be conducted using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Central, and EBSCO databases and clinical trial registries, will be searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies that have used autologous dentin graft (either in particulate/putty, or/matrix form) for socket preservation. The radiographic and clinical assessment of bone and soft tissue healing of the preserved sockets along with patient-related outcomes following surgery will be assessed. The risk of bias assessment of the RCTs and Non-RCTs will be assessed using the ‘Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool (ROB II) and ROBINS-I respectively. The certainty of evidence will be assessed by the GRADE approach. Discussion This evidence is important for dental clinicians and the public to make an informed decision when choosing graft material for socket preservation. The extracted teeth are considered biological waste; however, this evidence provides scope for using a less invasive autograft for bone regenerative procedures. Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42021201958 (Registered on 15/02/2021).

                Midkine is a secreted protein that acts as a growth factor or cytokine involved in cell survival and inflammatory processes. It accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The reproducibility of Midkine research would be enhanced if the community had access to well-characterized anti-Midkine antibodies. In this study, we characterized 8 commercial Midkine antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in a knockout cell line and isogenic parental control. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

<p>+)-Catechin exerts neuroprotective effects by triggering the Nrf2-induced antioxidant system and attenuates NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle activation through inhibition of ROS production and the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, thereby alleviating CCI-induced neuropathic pain in male rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms by which (+)-catechin alleviates neuropathic pain. Thirty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups: the sham group, the chronic constriction injury (CCI)group, the CCI+ ibuprofen group, and the CCI+ (+)-catechin group. CCI surgery induces thermal hyperalgesia in rats and (+)-catechin ameliorated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and repaired damaged sciatic nerve in rats. CCI decreased SOD levels in male rat spinal cord dorsal horn and promoted MDA production, induced oxidative stress by increasing NOX4 levels and decreasing antioxidant enzyme HO-1 levels, and also increased protein levels of TLR4, p-NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and IL-1β. In contrast, (+)-catechin reversed the above results. In i vitro experiments, (+)-catechin reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GMI-R1 cells after LPS stimulation and attenuated the co-expression of IBA-1 and NLRP3. It also showed significant inhibition of the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammatory pathways and activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant system. Overall, these findings suggest that (+)-catechin inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the triggering of the Nrf2-induced antioxidant system, the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, and the production of ROS to alleviate CCI-induced neuropathic pain in male rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95821">Bidirectional fear modulation by discrete anterior insular circuits in male mice</a></h4>

              
                The brain’s ability to appraise threats and execute appropriate defensive responses is essential for survival in a dynamic environment. Humans studies have implicated the anterior insular cortex (aIC) in subjective fear regulation and its abnormal activity in fear/anxiety disorders. However, the complex aIC connectivity patterns involved in regulating fear remain under investigated. To address this, we recorded single units in the aIC of freely moving male mice that had previously undergone auditory fear conditioning, assessed the effect of optogenetically activating specific aIC output structures in fear, and examined the organization of aIC neurons projecting to the specific structures with retrograde tracing. Single-unit recordings revealed that a balanced number of aIC pyramidal neurons’ activity either positively or negatively correlated with a conditioned tone-induced freezing (fear) response. Optogenetic manipulations of aIC pyramidal neuronal activity during conditioned tone presentation altered the expression of conditioned freezing. Neural tracing showed that non-overlapping populations of aIC neurons project to the amygdala or the medial thalamus, and the pathway bidirectionally modulated conditioned fear. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-amygdala pathway increased conditioned freezing, while optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-medial thalamus pathway decreased it. Our findings suggest that the balance of freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neuronal activity in the aIC and the distinct efferent circuits interact collectively to modulate fear behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89911">Determinantal point process attention over grid cell code supports out of distribution generalization</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural networks have made tremendous gains in emulating human-like intelligence, and have been used increasingly as ways of understanding how the brain may solve the complex computational problems on which this relies. However, these still fall short of, and therefore fail to provide insight into how the brain supports strong forms of generalization of which humans are capable. One such case is out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization – successful performance on test examples that lie outside the distribution of the training set. Here, we identify properties of processing in the brain that may contribute to this ability. We describe a two-part algorithm that draws on speciﬁc features of neural computation to achieve OOD generalization, and provide a proof of concept by evaluating performance on two challenging cognitive tasks. First we draw on the fact that the mammalian brain represents metric spaces using grid cell code (e.g., in the entorhinal cortex): abstract representations of relational structure, organized in recurring motifs that cover the representational space. Second, we propose an attentional mechanism that operates over the grid cell code using determinantal point process (DPP), that we call DPP attention (DPP-A) – a transformation that ensures maximum sparseness in the coverage of that space. We show that a loss function that combines standard task-optimized error with DPP-A can exploit the recurring motifs in the grid cell code, and can be integrated with common architectures to achieve strong OOD generalization performance on analogy and arithmetic tasks. This provides both an interpretation of how the grid cell code in the mammalian brain may contribute to generalization performance, and at the same time a potential means for improving such capabilities in artiﬁcial neural networks.

                Protein kinases act as central molecular switches in the control of cellular functions. Alterations in the regulation and function of protein kinases may provoke diseases including cancer. In this study we investigate the conformational states of such disease-associated kinases using the high sensitivity of the kinase conformation (KinCon) reporter system. We first track BRAF kinase activity conformational changes upon melanoma drug binding. Second, we also use the KinCon reporter technology to examine the impact of regulatory protein interactions on LKB1 kinase tumor suppressor functions. Third, we explore the conformational dynamics of RIP kinases in response to TNF pathway activation and small molecule interactions. Finally, we show that CDK4/6 interactions with regulatory proteins alter conformations which remain unaffected in the presence of clinically applied inhibitors. Apart from its predictive value, the KinCon technology helps to identify cellular factors that impact drug efficacies. The understanding of the structural dynamics of full-length protein kinases when interacting with small molecule inhibitors or regulatory proteins is crucial for designing more effective therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95180">Modulation of α-synuclein aggregation amid diverse environmental perturbation</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein (αS) is implicated in Parkinson’s disease due to its aberrant aggregation propensity. In a bid to identify the traits of its aggregation, here we computationally simulate the multi-chain association process of αS in aqueous as well as under diverse environmental perturbations. In particular, the aggregation of αS in aqueous and varied environmental condition led to marked concentration differences within protein aggregates, resembling liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Both saline and crowded settings enhanced the LLPS propensity. However, the surface tension of αS droplet responds differently to crowders (entropy-driven) and salt (enthalpy-driven). Conformational analysis reveals that the IDP chains would adopt extended conformations within aggregates and would maintain mutually perpendicular orientations to minimize inter-chain electrostatic repulsions. The droplet stability is found to stem from a diminished intra-chain interactions in the C-terminal regions of αS, fostering inter-chain residue-residue interactions. Intriguingly, a graph theory analysis identifies <i>small-world-like networks</i> within droplets across environmental conditions, suggesting the prevalence of a consensus interaction patterns among the chains. Together these findings suggest a delicate balance between molecular grammar and environment-dependent nuanced aggregation behavior of αS.

                Motor learning is often viewed as a unitary process that operates outside of conscious awareness. This perspective has led to the development of sophisticated models designed to elucidate the mechanisms of implicit sensorimotor learning. In this review, we argue for a broader perspective, emphasizing the contribution of explicit strategies to sensorimotor learning tasks. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework for motor learning that consists of three fundamental processes: reasoning, the process of understanding action–outcome relationships; refinement, the process of optimizing sensorimotor and cognitive parameters to achieve motor goals; and retrieval, the process of inferring the context and recalling a control policy. We anticipate that this ‘3R’ framework for understanding how complex movements are learned will open exciting avenues for future research at the intersection between cognition and action.

">Assessing the Impact of Selective Attention on the Cortical Tracking of the Speech Envelope in the Delta and Theta Frequency Bands and How Musical Training Does (Not) Affect It</a></h4>

              
                Oral communication regularly takes place amidst background noise, requiring the ability to selectively attend to a target speech stream. Musical training has been shown to be beneficial for this task. Regarding the underlying neural mechanisms, recent studies showed that the speech envelope is tracked by neural activity in the auditory cortex, which plays a role in the neural processing of speech, including speech in noise. The neural tracking occurs predominantly in two frequency bands, the delta and the theta band. However, much regarding the specifics of these neural responses, as well as their modulation through musical training, still remain unclear. Here, we investigated the delta- and theta- band cortical tracking of the speech envelope of attended and ignored speech using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We thereby assessed both musicians and non-musicians to explore potential differences between these groups. The cortical speech tracking was quantified through source-reconstructing the MEG data and subsequently relating the speech envelope in a certain frequency band to the MEG data using linear models. We thereby found the theta-band tracking to be dominated by early responses with comparable magnitudes for attended and ignored speech, whereas the delta band tracking exhibited both earlier and later responses that were modulated by selective attention. Almost no significant differences emerged in the neural responses between musicians and non-musicians. Our findings show that only the speech tracking in the delta but not in the theta band contributes to selective attention, but that this mechanism is essentially unaffected by musical training.

">What the Average Really Means: Dissociating Effect Size and Effect Prevalence using p-curve Mixtures</a></h4>

              
                Most research in the behavioral sciences aims to characterize effects of interest using sample means intended to describe the "typical" person. A difference in means is usually construed as a size difference in an effect common across subjects. However, mean effect size varies with both within-subject effect size and population prevalence (proportion of population showing the effect) in compared groups or across conditions. Few studies consider how prevalence affects mean effect size measurements and existing estimators of prevalence are, conversely, confounded by uncertainty about within-subject power. We introduce a widely applicable Bayesian method, the p-curve mixture model, that jointly estimates prevalence and effect size. Our approach outperforms existing prevalence estimation methods when within-subject power is uncertain and is sensitive to differences in prevalence or effect size across groups or experimental conditions. We present examples, extracting novel insights from existing datasets, and provide a user-facing software tool.

">Iowa Brain-Behavior Modeling Toolkit: An Open-Source MATLAB Tool for Inferential and Predictive Modeling of Imaging-Behavior and Lesion-Deficit Relationships</a></h4>

              
                The traditional analytical framework taken by neuroimaging studies in general, and lesion-behavior studies in particular, has been inferential in nature and has focused on identifying and interpreting statistically significant effects within the sample under study. While this framework is well-suited for hypothesis testing approaches, achieving the modern goal of precision medicine requires a different framework that is predictive in nature and that focuses on maximizing the predictive power of models and evaluating their ability to generalize beyond the data that were used to train them. However, few tools exist to support the development and evaluation of predictive models in the context of neuroimaging or lesion-behavior research, creating an obstacle to the widespread adoption of predictive modeling approaches in the field. Further, existing tools for lesion-behavior analysis are often unable to accommodate categorical outcome variables and often impose restrictions on the predictor data. Researchers therefore often must use different software packages and analytical approaches depending on whether they are addressing a classification vs. regression problem and on whether their predictor data correspond to binary lesion images, continuous lesion-network images, connectivity matrices, or other data modalities. To address these limitations, we have developed a MATLAB software toolkit that supports both inferential and predictive modeling frameworks, accommodates both classification and regression problems, and does not impose restrictions on the modality of the predictor data. The toolkit features both a graphical user interface and scripting interface, includes implementations of multiple mass-univariate, multivariate, and machine learning models, features built-in and customizable routines for hyper-parameter optimization, cross-validation, model stacking, and significance testing, and automatically generates text-based descriptions of key methodological details and modeling results to improve reproducibility and minimize errors in the reporting of methods and results. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of the toolkit features and demonstrate its functionality by applying it to the question of how expressive and receptive language impairments relate to lesion location, structural disconnection, and functional network disruption in a large sample of patients with left hemispheric brain lesions. We find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are most strongly associated with left lateral prefrontal and left posterior temporal/parietal damage, respectively. We also find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are associated with partially overlapping patterns of fronto-temporal structural disconnection, and that the associated functional networks are also similar. Importantly, we find that lesion location and lesion-derived network measures are highly predictive of both types of impairment, with predictions from models trained on these measures explaining ~30-40% of the variance on average when applied to data from patients not used to train the models. We have made the toolkit publicly available, and we have included a comprehensive set of tutorial notebooks to support new users in applying the toolkit in their studies.

">Experience instructs the refinement of feature-selectivity in the mouse primary visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Neurons exhibit selectivity for specific features: a property essential for extracting and encoding relevant information in the environment. This feature-selectivity is thought to be modifiable by experience at the level of the cortex. Here, we demonstrate that selective exposure to a feature during development can instruct the population representation for that feature in the primary visual thalamus. This thalamic plasticity is not simply inherited from the cortex because it is still observed when recordings were performed in the absence of cortical feedback. Moreover, plasticity is blocked in mutant mice that exhibit deficits in retinogeniculate refinement, indicating that alterations in feature-selectivity are a direct result of changes in feedforward connectivity. These experience-dependent changes persist into older ages-highlighting the importance of this developmental period in shaping population coding in the thalamus. Our results show that salient environmental features are hard-wired into thalamic circuits during a discrete developmental window.

">Single-cell spatial transcriptomics reveals molecular patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to α-synuclein pathology in a transgenic mouse model of Lewy body disease</a></h4>

              
                One of the unifying pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the presence of misfolded, aggregated, and often phosphorylated forms of the protein -synuclein in neurons. -Synuclein pathology appears in select populations of neurons throughout various cortical and subcortical regions, and little is currently known about why some neurons develop pathology while others are spared. Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human -synuclein (-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to -synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for -synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in -synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates -synuclein at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as underlying the selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ -syn- tg cells to reveal gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology, which included pSyn-dependent alterations in mitochondrial and endolysosomal genes. This study provides a comprehensive use case of IST, yielding new biological insights into the formation of -synuclein pathology and its downstream effects in a PD/DLB mouse model.

">Social Isolation During Adolescence Differentially Affects Spatial Learning in Adult Male and Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation is a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to these effects, because they are in a critical period of development marked by significant physical, hormonal, and social changes. However, it is unclear if the effects of social isolation on learning and memory are similar in both sexes or if they persist into adulthood after a period of recovery. We socially isolated male and female 129Sv/Ev mice throughout adolescence (post-natal days 29-56), provided a 2-week resocialization recovery period, and then tested spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in the active place avoidance task. After behavioral testing, mice were injected with 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) so that lasting effects of social isolation on cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus could be examined. We found that in males, isolation led to a modest impairment in the rate of initial spatial learning, whereas in females, initial learning was unaffected. However, when the location of the shock zone was switched during the conflict variant of the task, cognitive flexibility was impaired in females only. Similarly, social isolation reduced cell proliferation in the ventral dentate gyrus only in females. Together, these findings indicate that social isolation during adolescence differentially impairs spatial processing in males and females, with effects that persist into adulthood.

">Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 activation promotes sociability and regulates the expression of genes associated with anxiolytic-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                We previously demonstrated that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) prevents stress-mediated reductions in sociability. S1PR3 is a ubiquitously expressed G-protein coupled receptor that regulates immune system function, although its regulation of other biological processes is not well understood. Pharmacological activators of S1PR3 might provide important insights for understanding the neural substrates underlying sociability and/or serve as novel, preclinical treatments for social anxiety. Here we show that in mice, systemic injections of an S1PR3-specific agonist, CYM5541, promotes sociability in males and females whereas an S1PR3-specific antagonist, CAY10444, increases amygdala activation and promotes social anxiety-like behavior in females. S1PR3 expression is increased in the mPFC and dentate gyrus of females compared to males. RNA sequencing in the mPFC reveals that S1PR3 activation alters the expression of transcripts related to immune function, neurotransmission, transmembrane ion transport, and intracellular signaling. This work provides evidence that S1PR3 agonists, which have classically been used as immune modulators, might also be used as novel anxiolytics. S1PR3 might be an important hub gene for anxiolytic effects as it reduces inflammatory processes caused by stress and increases transcripts linked to anxiolytic neurotransmission.

">Characterization of Social and Repetitive Behaviors of Mllt11/Af1q/TcF7c Conditional Knockout Mice</a></h4>

              
                Mllt11 (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 11; also known as Af1q/TcF7c) has been identified as a novel regulator of neural development, playing a role in the migration and outgrowth of cortical projection neurons. We previously reported that the conditional inactivation of the Mllt11 gene in the mouse superficial cortex resulted in reduced connectivity of the corpus callosum and white fiber tracts, resulting in reduced cortical thickness. However, the behavioral consequences of Mllt11 loss are unknown. Callosal abnormalities are thought to be present in 3-5% of all neurodevelopmental disorders and reduced corpus callosum volume correlates with core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. Cortical thickness dysregulation is likewise shared among various neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. We therefore investigated the behavioral consequences of conditional knockout of Mllt11 in upper cortical layer 2/3 projection neurons using transgenic Cux2iresCre mice. Utilizing tasks designed to reflect core ASD symptoms, we examined the behaviors of both male and female conditional knockout animals. These tests included olfaction habituation/dishabituation, three-chambered social approach, marble burying, and nestlet shredding. We found sex-dependent disruptions in social preference, and nestlet shredding in animals lacking Mllt11, with the female mice presenting with more disruptions than the males. Understanding the behavioral phenotype associated with genes of interest specifically in the context of sex differences is crucial to individualized treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Impact of aging on the GABAB receptor-mediated connectome</a></h4>

              
                GABA B receptors (GABABRs) are heterodimeric seven-transmembrane receptors that interact with a range of proteins and form large protein complexes on cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains. As the brain ages, membrane cholesterol levels exhibit alterations, although it remains unclear how these changes impact protein-protein interactions and downstream signaling. Herein, we studied the structural bases for the interaction between GABABR and the KCC2 transporter, including their protein expression and distribution, and we compared data between young and aged rat cerebella. Also, we analyzed lipid profiles for both groups, and we used molecular dynamics simulations on three plasma membrane systems with different cholesterol concentrations, to further explore the GABABR-transporter interaction. Based on our results, we report that a significant decrease in GABAB2 subunit expression occurs in the aged rat cerebella. After performing a comparative co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we confirm that GABABR and KCC2 form a protein complex in adult and aged rat cerebella, although their interaction levels are reduced substantially as the cerebellum ages. On the other hand, our lipid analyses reveal a significant increase in cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels of the aged cerebella. Finally, we used the Martini coarse-grained model to conduct molecular dynamics simulations, from which we observed that membrane cholesterol concentrations can dictate whether the GABABR tail domains physically establish G protein-independent contacts with a transporter, and the timing when those associations eventually occur. Taken together, our findings illustrate how age-related alterations in membrane cholesterol levels affect protein-protein interactions, and how they could play a crucial role in regulating GABABR's interactome-mediated signaling.

">Aging amplifies sex differences in low alpha and low beta EEG oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Biological sex profoundly shapes brain function, yet its precise influence on neural oscillations was poorly understood. Despite decades of research, studies investigating sex-based variations in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have yielded inconsistent findings that obstructs what may be a potentially crucial source of inter-individual variability in brain function. To address this, we analyzed five publicly available resting-state datasets, comprising EEG data (n=445) and iEEG data (n=103). Our results revealed striking age-dependent sex differences: older adults (30-80 years) exhibited robust sex differences, with males showing heightened low alpha (8-9 Hz) activity in temporal regions and attenuated low beta (16-20 Hz) oscillations in parietal-occipital areas compared to females. Intriguingly, these sex-specific patterns were absent in younger adults (20-30 years), suggesting a complex interplay between sex and aging in shaping brain dynamics. Furthermore, we identified consistent sex-related activity in the precentral gyrus with the results of scalp EEG, potentially driving the observed scalp EEG differences. This multi-level analysis allowed us to bridge the gap between cortical and scalp-level observations, providing a more comprehensive picture of sex-related neural dynamics. To further investigate the functional implications of these oscillatory differences, we conducted correlation analyses to uncover significant associations between sex-specific oscillatory patterns and several lifestyle factors (behavioral and anthropometric measures) in older adults. This comprehensive investigation demonstrates the complex interplay between sex, age, and neural oscillations, revealing the variability in brain dynamics. And our findings highlight the importance of careful demographic consideration in EEG research design to ensure fairness in capturing the full spectrum of neurophysiological diversity.

">JM-20 administration to animals with lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, partially reverses motor damage and oxidative stress</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that JM-20, a new chemical hybrid molecule, protects against rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity. Also, we demonstrated that JM-20 blocks the formation of toxic alpha-synuclein aggregated species and aminochrome cytotoxicity. The present study sought to determine the neuroprotective property of JM-20 in animals with a partial lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). For in vivo studies, adult male Wistar rats were lesioned in the right substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) with 6-OHDA administration. Fifteen days after surgery, the animals asymmetry levels were assessed. Those with asymmetry values higher than 50% were divided into two groups: animals that did not receive any treatment and those that were administered with JM-20 (40 mg/kg, intragastric via gavage) for 27 days. Every seven days, the asymmetry values of the animals were analyzed until day 42 after the surgery. At the end of the experiment, the animals were euthanized and the SNpc and striatum were taken out for the analysis of oxidative stress. Our results reveal a behavioral function progressively recovered in the JM-20-treated animals, diminishing the percentage of motor asymmetry. Also, it improves some oxidative stress markers in the SNpc and the striatum of these animals. Our study provides the preclinical evidence to support the long-term neuroprotective potential of JM-20 in 6-OHDA hemiparkinson rat model, pointing out to its possible use as a disease-modifying agent in PD.

">Self-association enhances early attentional selection through automatic prioritization of socially salient signals</a></h4>

              
                Efficiently processing self-related information is critical for cognition, yet the earliest mechanisms enabling this self-prioritization remain unclear. By combining a temporal order judgement task with computational modelling based on the Theory of Visual Attention (TVA), we show how mere, arbitrary associations with the self can fundamentally alter attentional selection of sensory information into short-term memory/awareness, by enhancing the attentional weights and processing capacity devoted to encoding socially loaded information. This self-prioritization in attentional selection occurs automatically at early perceptual stages but reduces when active social decoding is required. Importantly, the processing benefits obtained from attentional selection via self-relatedness and via physical salience were additive, suggesting that social and perceptual salience captured attention via separate mechanisms. Furthermore, intra-individual correlations revealed an obligatory self-prioritization effect, whereby self-relatedness overpowered the contribution of perceptual salience in guiding attentional selection. Together, our findings provide evidence for the influence of self-relatedness during earlier, automatic stages of attentional section at the gateway to perception, distinct from later post-attentive processing stages.

	<p>In recent years, there has been marked interest in looking at the psychological consequences of medical conditions, such as traumatic or acquired brain injuries. Coping strategies are essential for clinical recovery and for dealing with the stressful events that a clinical condition brings with it. The purpose of this review is to analyze studies that explore how coping strategies influence psychological changes in patients with acquired brain injury. Studies were identified from research in the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. According to our findings, patients with ABI utilize different coping strategies based on the circumstances and factors such as the diagnosis severity, their age, time lived with the pathology, and personal characteristics, which have an influence on quality of life and rehabilitation. This review demonstrated that coping strategies have an impact on different aspects of the clinical and personal lives of patients with ABI. The rehabilitation process must consider the influence of these mechanisms on dealing with situations, as they can change cognitive and emotional perceptions of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; experience with the disease, as well as laying the foundations for functional or dysfunction in terms of the propensity of a person for the path of psychological and physical recovery.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aims to explore the changes in dynamic overlapping communities in the brains of schizophrenia (SZ) patients and further investigate the dynamic restructuring patterns of overlapping communities in SZ patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 43 SZ patients and 49 normal controls (NC) were selected for resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis was conducted separately on SZ patients and NC using rs-fMRI and Jackknife Correlation techniques to construct dynamic brain network models. Based on these models, a dynamic overlapping community detection method was utilized to explore the abnormal overlapping community structure in SZ patients using evaluation metrics such as the structural stability of overlapping communities, nodes&amp;amp;rsquo; functional diversity, and activity level of overlapping communities. Results: The stability of communities in SZ patients showed a decreasing trend. The changes in the overlapping community structure of SZ patients may be related to a decrease in the diversity of overlapping node functions. Additionally, compared to the NC group, the activity level of overlapping communities of SZ patients was significantly reduced. Conclusion: The structure or organization of the brain functional network in SZ patients is abnormal or disrupted, and the activity of the brain network in information processing and transmission is weakened in SZ patients.</p>

                <p>The release of neurotransmitters (NTs) at central synapses is dependent on a cascade of protein interactions, specific to the presynaptic compartment. Among those dedicated molecules, the cytosolic complexins play an incompletely defined role as synaptic transmission regulators. Complexins are multidomain proteins that bind soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes, conferring both inhibitory and stimulatory functions. Using systematic mutagenesis and comparing reconstituted in vitro membrane fusion assays with electrophysiology in cultured neurons from mice of either sex, we deciphered the function of the N-terminus of complexin (Cpx) II. The N-terminus (amino acid 1&ndash;27) starts with a region enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (1&ndash;12), which binds lipids. Mutants maintaining this hydrophobic character retained the stimulatory function of Cpx, whereas exchanges introducing charged residues perturbed both spontaneous and evoked exocytosis. Mutants in the more distal region of the N-terminal domain (amino acid 11&ndash;18) showed a spectrum of effects. On the one hand, mutation of residue A12 increased spontaneous release without affecting evoked release. On the other hand, replacing D15 with amino acids of different shapes or hydrophobic properties (but not charge) not only increased spontaneous release but also impaired evoked release. Most surprising, this substitution reduced the size of the readily releasable pool, a novel function for Cpx at mammalian synapses. Thus, the exact amino acid composition of the Cpx N-terminus fine-tunes the degree of spontaneous and evoked NT release.</p>

                <p>Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGlu8) is a heterogeneously expressed and poorly understood glutamate receptor with potential pharmacological significance. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical inhibitory modulator of the thalamocortical&ndash;corticothalamic (TC&ndash;CT) network and plays a crucial role in information processing throughout the brain, is implicated in a variety of psychiatric conditions, and is also a site of significant mGlu8 expression. Using both male and female mice, we determined via fluorescent in situ hybridization that parvalbumin-expressing cells in the TRN core and shell matrices (identified by <I>spp1+</I> and <I>ecel1+</I> expression, respectively), as well as the cortical layers involved in CT signaling, express <I>grm8</I> mRNA. We then assayed the physiological and behavioral impacts of perturbing <I>grm8</I> signaling in the TC circuit through conditional (adeno-associated virus-CRE mediated) and cell-type-specific constitutive deletion strategies. We show that constitutive parvalbumin <I>grm8</I> knock-out (PV<I><sup>grm8</sup></I> knock-out) mice exhibited (1) increased spontaneous excitatory drive onto dorsal thalamus relay cells and (2) impaired sensorimotor gating, measured via paired-pulse inhibition, but observed no differences in locomotion and thigmotaxis in repeated bouts of open field test (OFT). Conversely, we observed hyperlocomotive phenotypes and anxiolytic effects of AAV-mediated conditional knockdown of <I>grm8</I> in the TRN (TRN<I><sup>grm8</sup></I> knockdown) in repeated OFT. Our findings underscore a role for mGlu8 in regulating excitatory neurotransmission as well as anxiety-related locomotor behavior and sensorimotor gating, revealing potential therapeutic applications for various neuropsychiatric disorders and guiding future research endeavors into mGlu8 signaling and TRN function.</p>

                <p>Aberrant increase of arachidonic acid (ARA) has long been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the underlying causal mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we revealed a link between ARA mobilization and microglial dysfunction in A&beta; pathology. Lipidomic analysis of primary microglia from App<sup>NL-GF</sup> mice showed a marked increase in free ARA and lysophospholipids (LPLs) along with a decrease in ARA-containing phospholipids, suggesting increased ARA release from phospholipids (PLs). To manipulate ARA-containing PLs in microglia, we genetically deleted lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (<I>Lpcat3</I>), the main enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of ARA into PLs. Loss of microglial <I>Lpcat3</I> reduced the levels of ARA-containing PLs, free ARA and LPLs, leading to a compensatory increase in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-containing PLs in both male and female <I>App</I><sup>NL-GF</sup> mice. Notably, the reduction of ARA in microglia significantly ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses while enhancing the phagocytosis of A&beta; plaques and promoting the compaction of A&beta; deposits. Mechanistically, scRNA seq suggested that LPCAT3 deficiency facilitates phagocytosis by facilitating de novo lipid synthesis while protecting microglia from oxidative damage. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanistic link between ARA mobilization and microglial dysfunction in AD. Lowering brain ARA levels through pharmacological or dietary interventions may be a potential therapeutic strategy to slow down AD progression.</p>

                <p>Engaging the retrieval state (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Tulving, 1983</cross-ref>) impacts processing and behavior (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B34">Long and Kuhl, 2019</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">2021</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Smith et al., 2022</cross-ref>), but the extent to which top-down factors&mdash;explicit instructions and goals&mdash;versus bottom-up factors&mdash;stimulus properties such as repetition and similarity&mdash;jointly or independently induce the retrieval state is unclear. Identifying the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on retrieval state engagement is critical for understanding how control of task-relevant versus task-irrelevant brain states influence cognition. We conducted between-subjects recognition memory tasks on male and female human participants in which we varied test phase goals. We recorded scalp electroencephalography and used an independently validated mnemonic state classifier (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Long, 2023</cross-ref>) to measure retrieval state engagement as a function of top-down task goals (recognize old vs detect new items) and bottom-up stimulus repetition (hits vs correct rejections (CRs)). We find that whereas the retrieval state is engaged for hits regardless of top-down goals, the retrieval state is only engaged during CRs when the top-down goal is to recognize old items. Furthermore, retrieval state engagement is greater for low compared to high confidence hits when the task goal is to recognize old items. Together, these results suggest that top-down demands to recognize old items induce the retrieval state independent from bottom-up factors, potentially reflecting the recruitment of internal attention to enable access of a stored representation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/31/e0535222024?rss=1">RIM and RIM-Binding Protein Localize Synaptic CaV2 Channels to Differentially Regulate Transmission in Neuronal Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>At chemical synapses, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) translate electrical signals into a trigger for synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion. VGCCs and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains they elicit must be located precisely to primed SVs to evoke rapid transmitter release. Localization is mediated by Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) and RIM-binding proteins, which interact and bind to the C terminus of the CaV2 VGCC &alpha;-subunit. We studied this machinery at the mixed cholinergic/GABAergic neuromuscular junction of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> hermaphrodites. <I>rimb-1</I> mutants had mild synaptic defects, through loosening the anchoring of UNC-2/CaV2 and delaying the onset of SV fusion. UNC-10/RIM deletion much more severely affected transmission. Although postsynaptic depolarization was reduced, <I>rimb-1</I> mutants had increased cholinergic (but reduced GABAergic) transmission, to compensate for the delayed release. This did not occur when the excitation&ndash;inhibition (E&ndash;I) balance was altered by removing GABA transmission. Further analyses of GABA defective mutants and GABA<SUB>A</SUB> or GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor deletions, as well as cholinergic rescue of RIMB-1, emphasized that GABA neurons may be more affected than cholinergic neurons. Thus, RIMB-1 function differentially affects excitation&ndash;inhibition balance in the different motor neurons, and RIMB-1 thus may differentially regulate transmission within circuits. Untethering the UNC-2/CaV2 channel by removing its C-terminal PDZ ligand exacerbated the <I>rimb-1</I> defects, and similar phenotypes resulted from acute degradation of the CaV2 &beta;-subunit CCB-1. Therefore, untethering of the CaV2 complex is as severe as its elimination, yet it does not abolish transmission, likely due to compensation by CaV1. Thus, robustness and flexibility of synaptic transmission emerge from VGCC regulation.</p>

                <p>During navigation, the neocortex actively integrates learned spatial context with current sensory experience to guide behaviors. However, the relative encoding of spatial and sensorimotor information among cortical cells, and whether hippocampal feedback continues to modify these properties after learning, remains poorly understood. Thus, two-photon microscopy of male and female Thy1-GCaMP6s mice was used to longitudinally image neurons spanning superficial retrosplenial cortex and layers II&ndash;Va of primary and secondary motor cortices before and after bilateral dorsal hippocampal lesions. During behavior on a familiar cued treadmill, the locations of two obstacles were interchanged to decouple place-tuning from cue-tuning among position-correlated cells with fields at those locations. Subpopulations of place and cue cells each formed interareal gradients such that higher-level cortical regions exhibited higher fractions of place cells, whereas lower-level regions exhibited higher fractions of cue cells. Position-correlated cells in the motor cortex also formed translaminar gradients; more superficial cells were more likely to exhibit fields and were more sparsely and precisely tuned than deeper cells. After dorsal hippocampal lesions, a neural representation of the learned environment persisted, but retrosplenial cortex exhibited significantly increased cue-tuning, and, in motor cortices, both position-correlated cell recruitment and population activity at the unstable obstacle locations became more homogeneously elevated across laminae. Altogether, these results support that the hippocampus continues to modulate cortical responses in familiar environments, and the relative impact of descending feedback obeys hierarchical interareal and interlaminar gradients opposite to the flow of ascending sensory inputs.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) and intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) that express the glucagon gene (<I>Gcg</I>) give rise to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)-immunopositive axons in the spinal cord and many subcortical brain regions. Central GLP1 receptor signaling contributes to motivated behavior and stress responses in rats and mice, in which hindbrain GLP1 neurons are activated to express c-Fos in a metabolic state-dependent manner. The present study examined whether GLP1 inputs to distinct brain regions arise from distinct subsets of <I>Gcg</I>-expressing neurons, and mapped the distribution of axon collaterals arising from projection-defined GLP1 neural populations. Using our Gcg-Cre knock-in rat model, Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) tracing was conducted in adult male and female rats to compare axonal projections of IRt versus cNTS GLP1 neurons. Overlapping projections were observed in all brain regions that receive GLP1 input, with the caveat that cNTS injections produced Cre-dependent labeling of some IRt neurons, and vice versa. In additional experiments, specific diencephalic or limbic forebrain nuclei were microinjected with Cre-dependent retrograde AAVs (AAVrg) that expressed reporters to fully label the axon collaterals of transduced GLP1 neurons. AAVrg injected into each forebrain site labeled <I>Gcg</I>-expressing neurons in both the cNTS and IRt. The collective axon collaterals of labeled neurons entered the spinal cord and every brain region previously reported to contain GLP1-positive axons. These results indicate that the axons of GLP1 neural populations that innervate the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and/or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis collectively innervate all central regions that receive GLP1 axonal input.</p>

                <p>The ventrolateral medulla (VLM) is a crucial region in the brain for visceral and somatic control, serving as a significant source of synaptic input to the spinal cord. Experimental studies have shown that gene expression in individual VLM neurons is predictive of their function. However, the molecular and cellular organization of the VLM has remained uncertain. This study aimed to create a comprehensive dataset of VLM cells using single-cell RNA sequencing in male and female mice. The dataset was enriched with targeted sequencing of spinally-projecting and adrenergic/noradrenergic VLM neurons. Based on differentially expressed genes, the resulting dataset of 114,805 VLM cells identifies 23 subtypes of neurons, excluding those in the inferior olive, and five subtypes of astrocytes. Spinally-projecting neurons were found to be abundant in seven subtypes of neurons, which were validated through in situ hybridization. These subtypes included adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, and neurons expressing gene markers associated with premotor neurons in the ventromedial medulla. Further analysis of adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons and serotonergic neurons identified nine and six subtypes, respectively, within each class of monoaminergic neurons. Marker genes that identify the neural network responsible for breathing were concentrated in two subtypes of neurons, delineated from each other by markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These datasets are available for public download and for analysis with a user-friendly interface. Collectively, this study provides a fine-scale molecular identification of cells in the VLM, forming the foundation for a better understanding of the VLM's role in vital functions and motor control.</p>

                <p>Although hyperactivity is associated with a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, the early embryonic origins of locomotion have hindered investigation of pathogenesis of these debilitating behaviors. The earliest motor output in vertebrate animals is generated by clusters of early-born motor neurons (MNs) that occupy distinct regions of the spinal cord, innervating stereotyped muscle groups. Gap junction electrical synapses drive early spontaneous behavior in zebrafish, prior to the emergence of chemical neurotransmitter networks. We use a genetic model of hyperactivity to gain critical insight into the consequences of errors in motor circuit formation and function, finding that Fragile X syndrome model mutant zebrafish are hyperexcitable from the earliest phases of spontaneous behavior, show altered sensitivity to blockade of electrical gap junctions, and have increased expression of the gap junction protein Connexin 34/35. We further show that this hyperexcitable behavior can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of electrical synapses. We also use functional imaging to examine MN and interneuron (IN) activity in early embryogenesis, finding genetic disruption of electrical gap junctions uncouples activity between <I>mnx1</I><sup>+</sup> MNs and INs. Taken together, our work highlights the importance of electrical synapses in motor development and suggests that the origins of hyperactivity in neurodevelopmental disorders may be established during the initial formation of locomotive circuits.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), encoded by <I>GRIN</I> genes, are ionotropic glutamate receptors playing a critical role in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and synapse development. Genome sequence analyses have identified variants in <I>GRIN</I> genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying disease mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we have created and evaluated a transgenic mouse line carrying a missense variant <I>Grin2b<sup>L825V</sup></I>, corresponding to a de novo <I>GRIN2B</I> variant encoding GluN2B(L825V) found in a patient with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used HEK293T cells expressing recombinant receptors and primary hippocampal neurons prepared from heterozygous <I>Grin2b<sup>L825V/+</sup></I> (L825V/+) and wild-type (WT) <I>Grin2b<sup>+/+</sup></I> (+/+) male and female mice to assess the functional impact of the variant. Whole-cell NMDAR currents were reduced in neurons from L825V/+ compared with +/+ mice. The peak amplitude of NMDAR-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-eEPSCs) was unchanged, but NMDAR-eEPSCs in L825V/+ neurons had faster deactivation compared with +/+ neurons and were less sensitive to a GluN2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil. Together, these results suggest a decreased functional contribution of GluN2B subunits to synaptic NMDAR currents in hippocampal neurons from L825V/+ mice. The analysis of the GluN2B(L825V) subunit surface expression and synaptic localization revealed no differences compared with WT GluN2B. Behavioral testing of mice of both sexes demonstrated hypoactivity, anxiety, and impaired sensorimotor gating in the L825V/+ strain, particularly affecting males, as well as cognitive symptoms. The heterozygous L825V/+ mouse offers a clinically relevant model of <I>GRIN2B</I>-related ID/ASD, and our results suggest synaptic-level functional changes that may contribute to neurodevelopmental pathology.</p>

                <p>Complex auditory scenes pose a challenge to attentive listening, rendering listeners slower and more uncertain in their perceptual decisions. How can we explain such behaviors from the dynamics of cortical networks that pertain to the control of listening behavior? We here follow up on the hypothesis that human adaptive perception in challenging listening situations is supported by modular reconfiguration of auditory&ndash;control networks in a sample of <I>N</I> = 40 participants (13 males) who underwent resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Individual titration of a spatial selective auditory attention task maintained an average accuracy of ~70% but yielded considerable interindividual differences in listeners&rsquo; response speed and reported confidence in their own perceptual decisions. Whole-brain network modularity increased from rest to task by reconfiguring auditory, cinguloopercular, and dorsal attention networks. Specifically, interconnectivity between the auditory network and cinguloopercular network decreased during the task relative to the resting state. Additionally, interconnectivity between the dorsal attention network and cinguloopercular network increased. These interconnectivity dynamics were predictive of individual differences in response confidence, the degree of which was more pronounced after incorrect judgments. Our findings uncover the behavioral relevance of functional cross talk between auditory and attentional-control networks during metacognitive assessment of one's own perception in challenging listening situations and suggest two functionally dissociable cortical networked systems that shape the considerable metacognitive differences between individuals in adaptive listening behavior.</p>

                Background Road traffic accidents are a severe health concern in Ethiopia. This study aims to examine the primary contributing variables of road traffic accidents in Ethiopia, North Gondar Zone, under 24 administrative wereda’s. Methods This study utilized secondary data collected from both the werda-level and North Gondar central-level offices within the study areas. The sector police typically submit reports to the zonal-level offices annually. Information regarding crashes, fatalities, and injuries during the study period was extracted from these police reports. The research focused on analyzing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents attributed to various factors of drivers, vehicles, road conditions, pedestrians, and environmental influences. Results In a sample of 603 aggregate road traffic accidents, the data reveals that the majority of damage results are attributed to young drivers, accounting for 58% of the cases, with junior grade level drivers contributing 29.4%. Driving without a license was a significant factor, representing 87%, while accidents involving recruited driver stood at 63.2%. Vehicles with small to articulated trucks contributing to 39%. Mechanical failures were prevalent, with an unknown diagnosis rate of 48.3%. Vehicles in service for 2-5 years accounted for 29.4%. Road surface conditions were 46%, while rural roads saw a higher percentage at 51.2%. Weather conditions played a role also influential, as dry asphalt and gravel roads under main access ownership were linked to of accident, with 91.2% occurring during visible daylight hours between 8:00-12:00 and 15:00-17:00. The victims were predominantly farmers at 49.6%, followed by students at 23%. Conclusions To reduce road traffic accidents in the study area, it is essential to manage causative factors such as driver and road users, vehicles, roads, pedestrians, and environmental behaviors. The study suggests the development of a successful, up-to-date traffic accident database system regionally within respective offices.

                Blast-related craniofacial and ocular injuries have traditionally been associated with battlefields. In civilian populations, these injuries were infrequent, primarily arising from accidental explosions or terrorism incidents. Explosions can inflict severe damage to the neurological, ocular, and auditory systems through blast waves, high-velocity foreign bodies, and thermal radiation. The pathophysiology of blast-related craniofacial injuries is specific and complex, with severe cases often involving both penetrating and blunt trauma, leading to high mortality and morbidity rates. These injuries necessitate multidisciplinary management and can be defined as intracranial polytrauma. Recently, Niger has seen a surge in blast injuries, predominantly due to the increase in clandestine artisanal gold mining. Managing these injuries in resource-limited settings poses significant challenge. Comprehensive national data on these injuries are sparse due to high pre-hospital mortality rates and their infrequent occurrence, resulting in limited experience among our local physicians in their management. We present a rare case involving an artisanal gold miner with a history of smoking and previous concussions from explosion exposures. The patient was transferred to our hospital following severe craniofacial and ocular injuries caused by an accidental dynamite explosion at a mining site. On admission, the patient presented altered consciousness, agitation, unstable vital signs, multiple craniofacial wounds, including a large frontal wound with brain substance extrusion, diffuse facial burns, left globe rupture, and rhinorrhagia. After resuscitation and stabilization, brain imaging revealed multiple complex craniofacial fractures with foreign bodies. The patient underwent multidisciplinary surgical management. However, the postoperative course was complicated by post-concussive syndrome, and infection of the surgical wounds, necessitating surgical revision. Following the second surgery, the postoperative course was uneventful, although the patient experienced reduced visual acuity. This case highlights the management challenges in Niger and underscores the urgent need for clinical studies and training for gold miners to enhance safety practices in their activities.

Neural population responses in sensory systems are driven by external physical stimuli. This stimulus-response relationship is typically characterized by receptive fields, which have been estimated by <i>neural system identification</i> approaches. Such models usually require a large amount of training data, yet, the recording time for animal experiments is limited, giving rise to epistemic uncertainty for the learned neural transfer functions. While deep neural network models have demonstrated excellent power on neural prediction, they usually do not provide the uncertainty of the resulting neural representations and derived statistics, such as most exciting inputs (MEIs), from <i>in silico</i> experiments. Here, we present a Bayesian system identification approach to predict neural responses to visual stimuli, and explore whether explicitly modeling network weight variability can be beneficial for identifying neural response properties. To this end, we use variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of each model weight given the training data. Tests with different neural datasets demonstrate that this method can achieve higher or comparable performance on neural prediction, with a much higher data efficiency compared to Monte Carlo dropout methods and traditional models using point estimates of the model parameters. At the same time, our variational method provides us with an effectively infinite ensemble, avoiding the idiosyncrasy of any single model, to generate MEIs. It allows to estimate the uncertainty of stimulus-response function, which we have found to be negatively correlated with the predictive performance at model level and may serve to evaluate models. Furthermore, our approach enables us to identify response properties with credible intervals and to determine whether the inferred features are meaningful by performing statistical tests on MEIs. Finally, <i>in silico</i> experiments show that our model generates stimuli driving neuronal activity significantly better than traditional models in the limited-data regime.

Like other tropical and subtropical regions, influenza viruses can circulate year-round in Hong Kong. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in influenza activity. The objective of this study was to retrospectively forecast influenza activity during the year 2020 and assess the impact of COVID-19 public health social measures (PHSMs) on influenza activity and hospital admissions in Hong Kong. Using weekly surveillance data on influenza virus activity in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2019, we developed a statistical modeling framework to forecast influenza virus activity and associated hospital admissions. We conducted short-term forecasts (1–4 weeks ahead) and medium-term forecasts (1–13 weeks ahead) for the year 2020, assuming no PHSMs were implemented against COVID-19. We estimated the reduction in transmissibility, peak magnitude, attack rates, and influenza-associated hospitalization rate resulting from these PHSMs. For short-term forecasts, mean ambient ozone concentration and school holidays were found to contribute to better prediction performance, while absolute humidity and ozone concentration improved the accuracy of medium-term forecasts. We observed a maximum reduction of 44.6% (95% CI: 38.6% - 51.9%) in transmissibility, 75.5% (95% CI: 73.0% - 77.6%) in attack rate, 41.5% (95% CI: 13.9% - 55.7%) in peak magnitude, and 63.1% (95% CI: 59.3% - 66.3%) in cumulative influenza-associated hospitalizations during the winter-spring period of the 2019/2020 season in Hong Kong. The implementation of PHSMs to control COVID-19 had a substantial impact on influenza transmission and associated burden in Hong Kong. Incorporating information on factors influencing influenza transmission improved the accuracy of our predictions.

                <p>by Wilfredo Blanco, Joel Tabak, Richard Bertram</p>

The pulsatile activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons (GnRH neurons) is a key factor in the regulation of reproductive hormones. This pulsatility is orchestrated by a network of neurons that release the neurotransmitters kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy neurons), and produce episodic bursts of activity driving the GnRH neurons. We show in this computational study that the features of coordinated KNDy neuron activity can be explained by a neural network in which connectivity among neurons is modular. That is, a network structure consisting of clusters of highly-connected neurons with sparse coupling among the clusters. This modular structure, with distinct parameters for intracluster and intercluster coupling, also yields predictions for the differential effects on synchronization of changes in the coupling strength within clusters versus between clusters.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011728">Multitask learning of a biophysically-detailed neuron model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonas Verhellen, Kosio Beshkov, Sebastian Amundsen, Torbjørn V. Ness, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

The human brain operates at multiple levels, from molecules to circuits, and understanding these complex processes requires integrated research efforts. Simulating biophysically-detailed neuron models is a computationally expensive but effective method for studying local neural circuits. Recent innovations have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can accurately predict the behavior of these detailed models in terms of spikes, electrical potentials, and optical readouts. While these methods have the potential to accelerate large network simulations by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional differential equation based modelling, they currently only predict voltage outputs for the soma or a select few neuron compartments. Our novel approach, based on enhanced state-of-the-art architectures for multitask learning (MTL), allows for the simultaneous prediction of membrane potentials in each compartment of a neuron model, at a speed of up to two orders of magnitude faster than classical simulation methods. By predicting all membrane potentials together, our approach not only allows for comparison of model output with a wider range of experimental recordings (patch-electrode, voltage-sensitive dye imaging), it also provides the first stepping stone towards predicting local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from ANN-based simulations. While LFP and EEG are an important downstream application, the main focus of this paper lies in predicting dendritic voltages within each compartment to capture the entire electrophysiology of a biophysically-detailed neuron model. It further presents a challenging benchmark for MTL architectures due to the large amount of data involved, the presence of correlations between neighbouring compartments, and the non-Gaussian distribution of membrane potentials.

                <p>by Kaleeckal G. Harikumar, Peishen Zhao, Brian P. Cary, Xiaomeng Xu, Aditya J. Desai, Maoqing Dong, Jesse I. Mobbs, Chirine Toufaily, Sebastian G. B. Furness, Arthur Christopoulos, Matthew J. Belousoff, Denise Wootten, Patrick M. Sexton, Laurence J. Miller</p>

Development of optimal therapeutics for disease states that can be associated with increased membrane cholesterol requires better molecular understanding of lipid modulation of the drug target. Type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) agonist actions are affected by increased membrane cholesterol, enhancing ligand binding and reducing calcium signaling, while agonist actions of the closely related CCK2R are not. In this work, we identified a set of chimeric human CCK1R/CCK2R mutations that exchange the cholesterol sensitivity of these 2 receptors, providing powerful tools when expressed in CHO and HEK-293 model cell lines to explore mechanisms. Static, low energy, high-resolution structures of the mutant CCK1R constructs, stabilized in complex with G protein, were not substantially different, suggesting that alterations to receptor dynamics were key to altered function. We reveal that cholesterol-dependent dynamic changes in the conformation of the helical bundle of CCK receptors affects both ligand binding at the extracellular surface and G protein coupling at the cytosolic surface, as well as their interrelationships involved in stimulus-response coupling. This provides an ideal setting for potential allosteric modulators to correct the negative impact of membrane cholesterol on CCK1R.

                Background Preserving the structural integrity of the alveolar ridge is paramount in ensuring the success of dental implant procedures and optimizing both aesthetic and physiological outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of autologous dental grafting and explore intriguing results achieved through the utilization of allogeneic dental grafts obtained from a familial participant within the study’s framework. Methods Eleven patients necessitating bilateral dental extractions were enrolled in the study. Ten patients underwent autologous dental grafting on one side, while the contralateral side remained untreated. In the eleventh case, one side received autogenous dental grafting, while the other side was augmented with an allogeneic graft sourced from the patient’s son. Outcomes were monitored over a four-month period. Results Autogenous dental grafting led to a significant enhancement in bone density values and a reduction in osseous absorption rates(P<0.05) when compared to untreated sites among the ten patients who underwent the procedure. However, notable advancements were observed in patient 11 who received an allogeneic dental graft from a familial donor, suggesting potential superiority over autologous grafting in promoting bone regeneration. These findings underscore the promising prospects of employing allogeneic dental grafts sourced from family members to achieve optimal outcomes in alveolar ridge preservation. Conclusions The study underscores the significance of utilizing autologous dental grafts for preserving alveolar ridge dimensions. Importantly, the noteworthy improvement observed in patient outcomes resulting from the use of allogeneic dental grafts compared to autologous grafts raises several inquiries, particularly concerning the potential relationship between the patient and the donor. Trial registration The study is registered as a BRAZILIAN CLINICAL TEST RECORD (ReBEC): U1111-1305-2793 on 28-05-2024 ( https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-65qchvs).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-273/v2?src=rss">Development and application of a learning enjoyment scale for pedagogical activities [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The impact of learning enjoyment on motivation, enthusiasm, and overall learning experiences is significant. Previous studies, lacking an unbiased tool for measuring enjoyment and confronting various influencing factors, produced conflicting results regarding enjoyment levels in different instructional methods. Hence, we developed a learning enjoyment scale for evaluating both active and passive educational activities. We applied the developed scale to 112 first-year medical and dental students to assess their enjoyment during didactic physiology lectures and explored possible associated factors. Within this data note, we present students’ responses to the developed LES. The LES encompasses six dimensions: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, concentration, and enjoyment. Students provided ratings for each dimension on a five-point Likert scale, spanning from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The cumulative scores across the six dimensions range from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 30. These total scores can be categorized as excellent (> 24), acceptable (18-24), or low (< 18). The second section of the dataset examines specific factors influencing overall enjoyment, such as teacher proficiency, topic difficulty, active student participation, objectives fulfillment, low stress levels, and self-perceived acquisition of skills. In addition to objective measurement of students’ enjoyment level, the LES can be utilized for quantitative cross-comparisons between different teaching activities. By employing this dataset, we will undertake an analysis to determine the internal consistency of the Learning Enjoyment Scale (LES), with the anticipation that the outcomes will be published in another venue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92168">Amphibian mast cells serve as barriers to chytrid fungus infections</a></h4>

              
                Global amphibian declines are compounded by deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (<i>Bd</i>). Much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and microbiomes in controlling <i>Bd</i>, yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-<i>Bd</i> defenses. Mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like skin. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> frog mast cells during <i>Bd</i> infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of <i>X. laevis</i> skin mast cells confers anti-<i>Bd</i> protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by <i>Bd</i> infection. This includes a significant reduction in infiltration of <i>Bd</i>-infected skin by neutrophils, promoting mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands, and preventing <i>Bd</i>-mediated changes to skin microbiomes. Mammalian mast cells are known for their production of the pleiotropic interleukin-4 (IL4) cytokine and our findings suggest that the <i>X. laevis</i> IL4 plays a key role in manifesting the effects seen following cutaneous mast cell enrichment. Together, this work underscores the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-<i>Bd</i> defenses and illuminates a novel avenue for investigating amphibian host–chytrid pathogen interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92822">Structural and dynamic changes in P-Rex1 upon activation by PIP3 and inhibition by IP4</a></h4>

              
                PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and plays central roles in chemotaxis and cancer metastasis by serving as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac. The enzyme is synergistically activated by PIP<sub>3</sub> and heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, but mechanistic details remain poorly understood. While investigating the regulation of P-Rex1 by PIP<sub>3</sub>, we discovered that Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> (IP<sub>4</sub>) inhibits P-Rex1 activity and induces large decreases in backbone dynamics in diverse regions of the protein. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex revealed a conformation wherein the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain occludes the active site of the Dbl homology (DH) domain. This configuration is stabilized by interactions between the first DEP domain (DEP1) and the DH domain and between the PH domain and a 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain that extends from the C-terminal domain of P-Rex1. Disruption of the DH–DEP1 interface in a DH/PH-DEP1 fragment enhanced activity and led to a more extended conformation in solution, whereas mutations that constrain the occluded conformation led to decreased GEF activity. Variants of full-length P-Rex1 in which the DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interfaces were disturbed exhibited enhanced activity during chemokine-induced cell migration, confirming that the observed structure represents the autoinhibited state in living cells. Interactions with PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes led to disruption of these interfaces and increased dynamics protein-wide. Our results further suggest that inositol phosphates such as IP<sub>4</sub> help to inhibit basal P-Rex1 activity in neutrophils, similar to their inhibitory effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91540">A kidney-hypothalamus axis promotes compensatory glucose production in response to glycosuria</a></h4>

              
                The kidneys facilitate energy conservation through reabsorption of nutrients including glucose. Almost all the filtered blood glucose is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Loss of glucose in urine (glycosuria) is offset by an increase in endogenous glucose production to maintain normal energy supply in the body. How the body senses this glucose loss and consequently enhances glucose production is unclear. Using renal <i>Slc2a2</i> (also known as <i>Glut2</i>) knockout mice, we demonstrate that elevated glycosuria activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn drives endogenous glucose production. This phenotype was attenuated by selective afferent renal denervation, indicating the involvement of the afferent nerves in promoting the compensatory increase in glucose production. In addition, through plasma proteomics analyses we observed that acute phase proteins - which are usually involved in the body’s defense mechanisms against a threat – were the top candidates which were either upregulated or downregulated in renal <i>Slc2a2</i> KO mice. Overall, afferent renal nerves contribute to promoting endogenous glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria and loss of glucose in urine is sensed as a biological threat in mice. These findings may be useful in improving the efficiency of drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors that are intended to treat hyperglycemia by enhancing glycosuria but are met with a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production.

">Feature specific neuronal oscillations in cortical layers</a></h4>

              
                The particular role of cortical oscillations has been a long-debated topic that resulted in a variety of theoretical frameworks. Oscillatory activity in the [alpha] band has been associated with sensory processing, attention as well as other cognitive functions, while [gamma] band oscillations is thought to be related to stimulus feature processing. Current theoretical frameworks rely on the separation of the cortical architecture into layers. Recently, methodological advancements have allowed to test layer specific frameworks on the role of oscillations in cortical computations in healthy human participants. Using EEG fMRI, we have investigated for the first time both, stimulus feature specificity (line orientation) and the relationship between the laminar BOLD activity and [alpha] and {gamma} band oscillations. We find {gamma} oscillations to be positively correlated with feature specific signals in superficial layers as predicted by the literature, but we found a deep layer contribution as well. Furthermore we found a layer (and frequency) dissociation within the  band for general, feature unspecific, processes and a feature related process. The power of the -band correlated negatively with feature unspecific neural activity in all cortical layers. We further found that high frequency  oscillations were specifically related to stimulus feature specific BOLD signal in deep and superficial layers. More interestingly, we also observed a general modulation effect for negative BOLD signal deflections in line with the inhibitory role of  during visual attention in superficial layers. Those findings support the association of {gamma} band oscillations with visual feature processing and further point towards the involvement of multiple  oscillations in more general and feature related processes.

">Overwriting an instinct: visual cortex instructs learning to suppress fear responses</a></h4>

              
                Fast instinctive responses to environmental stimuli can be crucial for survival, but are not always optimal. Based on prior experience, animals can thus adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions. However, the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We show that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway involving the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning: instead, the learnt behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over fear responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses through a novel corticofugal pathway.

">A subset of brain regions within adult functional connectivity networks demonstrate high reliability across early development</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex contains groups of areas that support sensory, motor, cognitive, and affective functions, often categorized as functional networks. These areas show stronger internal and weaker external functional connectivity (FC) and exhibit similar FC profiles within rather than between networks. Previous studies have demonstrated the development of these networks from nascent forms present before birth to their mature, adult-like topography in childhood. However, analyses often still use definitions based on adult functional networks. We aim to assess how this might lead to the misidentification of functional networks and explore potential consequences and solutions. Our findings suggest that even though adult networks provide only a marginally better than-chance description of the infant FC organization, misidentification was largely driven by specific areas. By restricting functional networks to areas showing adult-like network clustering, we observed consistent within-network FC both within and across scans and throughout development. Additionally, these areas were spatially closer to locations with low variability in network identity among adults. Our analysis aids in understanding the potential consequences of using adult networks "as is" and provides guidance for future research on selecting and utilizing functional network models based on the research question and scenario.

">A distinct circuit for biasing visual perceptual decisions and modulating superior colliculus activity through the mouse posterior striatum</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia play a key role in visual perceptual decisions. Despite being the primary target in the basal ganglia for inputs from the visual cortex, the posterior striatum's (PS) involvement in visual perceptual behavior remains unknown in rodents. We reveal that the PS direct pathway is largely segregated from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) direct pathway, the other major striatal target for visual cortex. We investigated the role of the PS in visual perceptual decisions by optogenetically stimulating striatal medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway (D1-MSNs) of mice performing a visual change-detection task. PS D1-MSN activation robustly biased visual decisions in a manner dependent on visual context, timing, and reward expectation. We examined the effects of PS and DMS direct pathway activation on neuronal activity in the superior colliculus (SC), a major output target of the basal ganglia. Activation of either direct pathway rapidly modulated SC neurons, but mostly targeted different SC neurons and had opposite effects. These results demonstrate that the PS in rodents provides an important route for controlling visual decisions, in parallel with the better known DMS, but with distinct anatomical and functional properties.

">Motor sequence learning-induced corticospinal plasticity is biased towards sensorimotor mu rhythm peak phases</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortical (M1) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) increases corticospinal output and improves motor learning when delivered during sensorimotor mu rhythm trough but not peak phases, suggesting that mechanisms supporting motor learning may be most active during mu trough phases. If so, learning-related corticospinal plasticity should be most evident during mu trough phases. Healthy adults were assigned to either a sequence or control group. Participants in the sequence group practiced the implicit serial reaction time task (SRTT), which contained an embedded, repeating 12-item sequence. Participants in the control group practiced a version of the SRTT that contained no sequence. We measured mu phase-independent and phase-dependent MEP amplitudes using EEG-informed single-pulse TMS before, immediately, and 30 minutes after the SRTT in both groups. All participants performed a retention test one hour after SRTT acquisition. In both groups, mu phase-independent MEP amplitudes increased following SRTT acquisition, but the pattern of mu phase-dependent MEP amplitude increases after SRTT acquisition differed between groups. MEP amplitude changes from baseline to 30 minutes after SRTT acquisition more strongly differed across phases in the control relative to the sequence group, with the control group showing smaller increases in peak- than trough-specific MEPs. Contrary to our original hypothesis, results revealed that sequence learning recruits peak- rather than trough-specific neurophysiological mechanisms. Overall, these findings suggest that mu peak phases may provide protected time windows for motor memory consolidation and demonstrate the presence of a mu phase-dependent motor learning mechanism in the human brain.

">Coding of egocentric distance in the macaque ventral intraparietal area</a></h4>

              
                The encoding of three-dimensional visual spatial information is of ultimate importance in everyday life, in particular for successful navigation toward targets or threat avoidance. Eye-movements challenge this spatial encoding: 2-3 times per second, they shift the image of the outside world across the retina. The macaque ventral intraparietal area (VIP) stands out from other areas of the dorsal "where" pathway of the primate visual cortical system: many neurons encode visual information irrespective of horizontal and vertical eye position. But does this gaze invariance of spatial encoding at the single neuron level also apply to egocentric distance? Here, concurrent with recordings from area VIP, monkeys fixated a central target at one of three distances (vergence), while a visual stimulus was shown at one of seven distances (disparity). Most neurons' activity was modulated independently by both disparity and eye vergence, demonstrating a different type of invariance than for visual directions. By using population activity, we were able to decode egocentric distance of a stimulus which demonstrates that egocentric distances are nonetheless represented within the neuronal population. Our results provide further strong evidence for a role of area VIP in 3D space encoding.

">Dynorphin modulates motivation through a pallido-amygdala cholinergic circuit</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin and its receptor kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) have been implicated in divergent behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that dynorphin released from nucleus accumbens dynorphinergic neurons exerts powerful modulation over a ventral pallidum (VP) disinhibitory circuit, thereby controlling cholinergic transmission to the amygdala and motivational drive in mice. On one hand, dynorphin acts postsynaptically via KORs on local GABAergic neurons in the VP to promote disinhibition of cholinergic neurons, which release acetylcholine into the amygdala to invigorate reward-seeking behaviors. On the other hand, dynorphin also acts presynaptically via KORs on dynorphinergic terminals to limit its own release. Such autoinhibition keeps cholinergic neurons from prolonged activation and release of acetylcholine, and prevents perseverant reward seeking. Our study reveals how dynorphin exquisitely modulate motivation through cholinergic system, and provides an explanation for why these neuromodulators are involved in motivational disorders, including depression and addiction.

">Structural disconnections caused by white matter hyperintensities in post-stroke spatial neglect</a></h4>

              
                White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a common feature of cerebral small vessel disease, affect a wide range of cognitive dysfunctions, including spatial neglect. The latter is a disorder of spatial attention and exploration typically after right hemisphere brain damage. To explore the impact of WMH on neglect-related structural disconnections, the present study investigated the indirectly quantified structural disconnectome induced by either stroke lesion alone, WMH alone, or their combination. Further, we compared different measures of structural disconnections - voxel-wise, pairwise, tract-wise, and parcel-wise - to identify neural correlates and predict acute neglect severity. We observed that WMH-derived disconnections alone were not associated to neglect behavior. However, when combined with disconnections derived from individual stroke lesions, pre-stroke WMH contributed to post-stroke neglect severity by affecting right frontal and subcortical substrates, like the middle frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the fronto-pontine tract. Predictive modeling demonstrated that voxel-wise disconnection data outperformed other measures of structural disconnection, explaining 42% of the total variance. Compared to using stroke lesion anatomy, prediction performance can be improved by either estimating stroke-based structural disconnections or delineating the combined anatomy of stroke lesion and WMH. We conclude that pre-stroke alterations in the white matter microstructure due to WMH contribute to post-stroke deficits in spatial attention, likely by impairing the integrity of human attention networks.

                This study introduces a revised version of the computational auditory signal processing and perception (CASP) model (Jepsen et al., 2008), which has undergone substantial updates and refinements aimed at enhancing its accuracy and usability across various applications. A primary motivation for the revision was the integration of a more realistic non-linear inner hair cell (IHC) model to address the limitations of its more simplistic predecessor. Demonstrating backwards compatibility, the revised model exhibited similar predictive power to previous CASP implementations across conditions of intensity discrimination, simultaneous and forward masking, and modulation detection, effectively accounting for data from normal-hearing listeners. Additionally, improved decision-making strategies and a streamlined model configuration further enhance the model's usability and accessibility. Overall, the revised CASP offers a more accurate and intuitive framework for simulating auditory processing and perception across diverse conditions and tasks. The revised model may be a useful tool in studying the influence of the ear's nonlinear response properties on internal representations, particularly concerning the effects of sensorineural hearing loss on auditory perception.

">Contributions of genetic variation in astrocytes to cell and molecular mechanisms of risk and resilience to late onset Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrocytes are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and several AD genetic risk variants are associated with genes highly expressed in astrocytes. However, the contribution of genetic risk within astrocytes to cellular processes relevant to the pathogenesis of AD remains ill-defined. Here we present a resource for studying AD genetic risk in astrocytes using a large collection of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from deeply phenotyped individuals with a range of neuropathological and cognitive outcomes. IPSC lines from forty-four individuals were differentiated into astrocytes followed by unbiased molecular profiling using RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the utility of this resource in examining gene- and pathway-level associations with clinical and neuropathological traits, as well as in analyzing genetic risk and resilience factors through parallel analyses of iPSC-astrocytes and brain tissue from the same individuals. Our analyses reveal that genes and pathways altered in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD individuals are concordantly dysregulated in AD brain tissue. This includes increased prefoldin proteins, extracellular matrix factors, COPI-mediated trafficking components and reduced proteins involved in cellular respiration and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, iPSC-derived astrocytes from individuals resilient to high AD neuropathology show elevated basal levels of interferon response proteins and increased secretion of interferon gamma. Correspondingly, higher polygenic risk scores for AD are associated with lower levels of interferon response proteins. This study establishes an experimental system that integrates genetic information with a heterogeneous set of iPSCs to identify genetic contributions to molecular pathways affecting AD risk and resilience.

                The salience assignment is pivotal for both natural and artificial intelligence. Pioneering studies established that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons process behaviorally relevant salient information. However, the neural circuit mechanism underlying salience assignment remains poorly understood. Here we show that the acetylcholine (ACh) level in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) dynamically represented behavioral salience. Distinct neuronal subpopulations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs), antagonistically and specifically promote and suppress ACh release in the BLA, but not the cortex and hippocampus. These striatal D1 and D2 MSNs regulate BLA ACh by disinhibiting and inhibiting cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain subregion substantia innominata (SI), respectively. Optogenetic manipulations of the pathway from striatal D1 and D2 MSNs to the SI opposingly affect associative learning. Our findings uncover an unconventional role of striatal MSNs in salience assignment via regulating the salience-representing amygdalar ACh activity.

">Cholecystokinin modulates age-dependent Thalamocortical Neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                The thalamocortical pathway exhibits neuroplasticity not only during the critical period but also in adulthood. Here, we aimed to investigate the modulation of age-dependent thalamocortical plasticity by cholecystokinin (CCK). Our findings revealed the expression of CCK in thalamocortical neurons, and high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamocortical pathway elicited the release of CCK in auditory cortex (ACx), as evidenced by CCK sensor. HFS of the medial geniculate body (MGB) induced thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) in wildtype young adult mice. However, knockdown of Cck expression in MGB neurons or blockade of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) in ACx effectively abolished HFS-induced LTP. Notably, this LTP could not be elicited in both juvenile mice (week 3) and mice over 18 months old, due to the absence of CCKBR in juvenile mice and the inability of CCK to be released in aged mice. Remarkably, the administration of exogenous CCK into the auditory cortex of the aged mice restored this LTP, accompanied by a significant improvement in frequency discrimination. These findings suggest the potential of CCK as a therapeutic intervention for addressing neurodegenerative deficits associated with thalamocortical neuroplasticity.

">Enhanced and idiosyncratic neural representations of personally typical scenes</a></h4>

              
                Previous research shows that the typicality of visual scenes (i.e., if they are good examples of a category) determines how easily they can be perceived and represented in the brain. However, the unique visual diets individuals are exposed to across their lifetimes should sculpt very personal notions of typicality. Here, we thus investigated whether scenes that are more typical to individual observers are more accurately perceived and represented in the brain. We used drawings to enable participants to describe typical scenes (e.g., a kitchen) and converted these drawings into 3D renders. These renders were used as stimuli in a scene categorization task, during which we recorded EEG. In line with previous findings, categorization was most accurate for renders resembling the typical scene drawings of individual participants. Our EEG analyses reveal two critical insights on how these individual differences emerge on the neural level: First, personally typical scenes yielded enhanced neural representations from around 200 ms after onset. Second, personally typical scenes were represented in idiosyncratic ways, with reduced dependence on high-level visual features. We interpret these findings in a predictive processing framework, where individual differences in internal models of scene categories formed through experience shape visual analysis in idiosyncratic ways.

">Brain-responsive music enables non-invasive, targeted and unobtrusive neurostimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We are developing a new closed-loop brain stimulation method by embedding, within music, auditory elements that respond to the listeners brain activity. Here we show that this brain-responsive music has systematic and targeted effects on neural oscillations implicated in a variety of neurological and mental health disorders. Approach: We recorded magnetoencephalogram (MEG) or electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from participants as they listened to music synthesized by commercial audio software. Brain signals were bandpass filtered, phase-shifted and used to control the timbre and/or timing of notes within the music. Main results: Listening to brain-responsive music induced peaks and troughs in spectral power at frequencies that depended systematically on the phase-shift applied to the brain signal. Phase-dependent modulation was greatest at the centre frequency of the filter. As a result, by calibrating these parameters we could achieve selective enhancement or suppression of either theta (5 Hz) or alpha (10 Hz) oscillations. Moreover, by chosing different sensor locations we could target power modulation to either frontal or temporal cortex. The phase-dependent power modulation observed with brain-responsive music was significantly attenuated when participants listened to identical music as a conventional, open-loop stimulus. Finally, we demonstrate that brain activity could be modulated by more complex compositions combining a variety of brain-responsive musical elements controlled by a wireless, wearable EEG headband suitable for home use. Significance: Brain-responsive music provides an unobtrusive and targeted method of modulating neural oscillations in the listeners brain, and may enable both creative and therapeutic applications of Brain Computer Interface technologies.

">How different immersive environments affect intracortical brain computer interfaces</a></h4>

              
                As brain-computer interface (BCI) research advances, many new applications are being developed. Tasks can be performed in different environments, and whether a BCI user can switch environments seamlessly will influence the ultimate utility of a clinical device. Here we investigate the importance of the immersiveness of the virtual environment used to train BCI decoders on the resulting decoder and its generalizability between environments. Two participants who had intracortical electrodes implanted in their precentral gyrus used a BCI to control a virtual arm, either viewed immersively through virtual reality goggles or at a distance on a flat television monitor. Each participant performed better with a decoder trained and tested in the environment they had used the most prior to the study, one for each environment type. The neural tuning to the desired movement was minimally influenced by the immersiveness of the environment. Finally, in further testing with one of the participants, we found that decoders trained in one environment generalized well to the other environment, but the order in which the environments were experienced within a session mattered. Overall, experience with an environment was more influential on performance than the immersiveness of the environment, but BCI performance generalized well after accounting for experience.

">Visual Congruency Modulates Music Reward through Sensorimotor Integration</a></h4>

              
                There is emerging evidence that a performer's body movements may enhance the music-induced pleasure of audiences. However, the neural mechanism underlying such modulation remains largely unexplored. This study utilized psychophysiological and electroencephalographic data collected from listeners as they watched and listened to manipulated vocal (Mandarin lyrics) and violin performances of Japanese and Chinese pop music. All participants were unfamiliar with the violin or Mandarin. The auditory and visual elements of the stimuli were either congruent (original recording) or incongruent (drawn from unrelated music videos). We found that congruent visual movements, as opposed to incongruent ones, increased both subjective pleasure ratings and skin conductance responses but only during vocal performances. Then, we examined the coherence between the music signal and sensorimotor Mu-band oscillatory neural activity and found that congruent visual movements enhanced Mu entrainment exclusively to vocal music signal. Further, mediation analysis demonstrated that neural entrainment to vocal music significantly mediated the visual modulation of music-induced pleasure. In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence on how congruent visual movements can heighten music-induced pleasure through enhanced sensorimotor integration.

	<p>Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), occurring after blood supply restoration, contributes significantly to stroke-related deaths. This study explored the combined impact and mechanisms of astragaloside IV (AS-IV), hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), and their combination in mitigating IRI. Male Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to the Sham, MCAO, MCAO+AS-IV, MCAO+HSYA, and MCAO+AS-IV+HSYA groups. Neurological deficits and cerebral infarction were examined after restoring the blood supply to the brain. Pathomorphological changes in the cerebral cortex were observed via HE staining. IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-18 were quantified using ELISA. The expression of NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B and GSDMD in the ischemic cerebrum was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Caspase-1, and GSDMD in the ischemic cerebrum were evaluated using Western blot. The MCAO+AS-IV, MCAO+HSYA, and MCAO+AS-IV+HSYA groups exhibited notably better neurological function and cerebral infarction compared with the MCAO group. The combined treatment demonstrated superior brain tissue injury alleviation. Reductions in NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, GSDMD positive cells, and NLRP3/ASC/IL-1&amp;amp;beta;/Caspase-1/GSDMD protein expression in the ischemic brain were significantly more pronounced with the combined therapy, indicating a synergistic effect in countering cerebral IRI via the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B/NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway inhibition of cell pyroptosis-induced injury.</p>

	<p>This study analyzed China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study data to explore the HbA1c&amp;amp;ndash;depression link, including depressive trajectories, while considering the mitigating impact of healthy lifestyles. Cross-lagged panel models and group-based trajectory modeling were performed to investigate the temporal relationship between HbA1c levels and depressive symptoms, as well as the depressive trajectories. Structural equation models were used to assess the mediating effects of healthy lifestyles. The mean age of the participants was 57.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.04 years, with 53.68% being female. Analyzing 8826 participants across three waves, we observed a significant prediction of subsequent depressive symptoms by the preceding HbA1c levels (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.296; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Four distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms were distinguished: stable low, stable moderate, increasing, and stable high. Elevated HbA1c levels were associated with a higher risk of developing stable high (OR 1.12 and 95% CI 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;1.23), increasing (OR 1.21 and 95% CI 1.11&amp;amp;ndash;1.32), and stable moderate depressive symptoms (OR 1.07 and 95% CI 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;1.13). Engaging in two healthy life behaviors reduced stable high and increasing depressive pattern risks by 32% and 30%, respectively. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle lessened 7.2% of the impact of high HbA1c levels on the subsequent depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating adequate sleep and light physical activities, which might reduce the adverse impact of elevated HbA1c levels on depressive symptoms.</p>

	<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was suggested as a potential target for intervention to mitigate brain injury. However, its neuro-protective effect in post-resuscitation care has not been proven. We investigated the time-course of changes in IL-6 and its association with other markers (systemic inflammation and myocardial and neuronal injury), according to the injury severity of the cardiac arrest. This retrospective study analyzed IL-6 and other markers at baseline and 24, 48, and 72 h after the return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was the association of IL-6 with injury severity as assessed using the revised Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome for Therapeutic Hypothermia scoring system (low, moderate, and high severity). Of 111 patients, 22 (19.8%), 61 (55.0%), and 28 (25.2%) had low-, moderate-, and high-severity scores, respectively. IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the low-severity group than in the moderate- and high-severity groups at baseline and at 24 h and 72 h (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005). While IL-6 was not independently associated with neuronal injury markers in the low-severity group, it was demonstrated to be associated with it in the moderate-severity (&amp;amp;beta; [95% CI] = 4.3 [0.1&amp;amp;ndash;8.6], R2 = 0.11) and high-severity (&amp;amp;beta; [95% CI] = 7.9 [3.4&amp;amp;ndash;12.5], R2 = 0.14) groups. IL-6 exhibits distinct patterns across severity and shows differential associations with systemic inflammation or neuronal injury.</p>

	<p>This study explores the potential of using a Siamese Network as a biomarker for assessing the effectiveness of Dolphin-Assisted Therapy (DAT) in children with Spastic Cerebral Palsy (SCP). The problem statement revolves around the need for objective measures to evaluate the impact of DAT on patients with SCP, considering the subjective nature of traditional assessment methods. The methodology involves training a Siamese network, a type of neural network designed to compare similarities between inputs, using data collected from SCP patients undergoing DAT sessions. The study employed Event-Related Potential (ERP) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyses to examine cerebral activity and brain rhythms, proposing the use of SNN to compare electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of children with cerebral palsy before and after Dolphin-Assisted Therapy. Testing on samples from four children yielded a high average similarity index of 0.9150, indicating consistent similarity metrics before and after therapy. The network is trained to learn patterns and similarities between pre- and post-therapy evaluations, in order to identify biomarkers indicative of therapy effectiveness. Notably, the Siamese Network&amp;amp;rsquo;s architecture ensures that comparisons are made within the same feature space, allowing for more accurate assessments. The results of the study demonstrate promising findings, indicating different patterns in the output of the Siamese Network that correlate with improvements in symptoms of SCP post-DAT. Confirming these observations will require large, longitudinal studies but such findings would suggest that the Siamese Network could have utility as a biomarker in monitoring treatment responses for children with SCP who undergo DAT and offer them more objective as well as quantifiable manners of assessing therapeutic interventions. Great discrepancies in neuronal voltage perturbations, 7.9825 dB on average at the specific samples compared to the whole dataset (6.2838 dB), imply a noted deviation from resting activity. These findings indicate that Dolphin-Assisted Therapy activates particular brain regions specifically during the intervention.</p>

	<p>Reports suggest possible risks of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including heart failure, associated with non-ergot dopamine agonist (DA) use in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The objectives of our review were to evaluate the risk of heart failure and other adverse cardiovascular reactions in PD patients who received a non-ergot DA compared with other anti-PD pharmacological interventions, placebo, or no intervention. Studies were identified via searches of six bibliographic databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS) were eligible for study inclusion. Random-effect meta-analyses were performed to estimate adverse cardiovascular reaction risks. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. In total, forty-four studies (thirty-six RCTs and eight NRS) satisfied our inclusion criteria. A single RCT found no significant difference in the risk of heart failure with ropinirole compared with bromocriptine (odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 2.04; low certainty). Conversely, three case&amp;amp;ndash;control studies reported a risk of heart failure with non-ergot DA treatment. The quality of evidence for the risk of heart failure was judged as low or very low. Findings suggest that non-ergot DA use may be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure. Studies are needed to better understand cardiovascular risks associated with PD treatment.</p>

	<p>Identifying the patients who are likely to be non-responders to a certain treatment may allow clinicians to provide alternative strategies and avoid frustration and unrealistic expectations for the patients and their families. A retrospective study on 145 children treated with visual hemisphere-specific stimulation examined the specific profiles (reading, writing, metaphonology, memory, callosal functions) of non-responders, and identified predictors of response to intervention (reading, reading and writing) through linear regression models. The effects of additional variables such as rapid automatized naming (RAN) and Visual Search were investigated in a subsample of 48 participants. Subgroups related to gender and dyslexia subtype were considered in the analyses. The results highlight an Intervention Differential Effect (IDE) not depending on regression to the mean and mathematical coupling effects. The characteristics of non-responders for reading seem to correspond children with mild reading and severe writing impairments; non-responders for reading and writing are those with impaired callosal transfer. Predictors of overall response to intervention were pre-test reading and writing scores; phoneme blending, accuracy in visual search and speed in rapid automatized naming contributed to explaining response variance. Specific predictors for female vs. male participants and dyslexia subtypes were identified.</p>

	<p>Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness due to autoantibodies targeting neuromuscular junction proteins. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressive therapy, has shown potential for managing MG with fewer side effects compared to other treatments. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MMF in MG patients in a real-life multicenter setting. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on generalized MG patients, refractory to azathioprine (AZA) and treated with MMF alone or with steroids, at three Italian centers from January 2011 to February 2024. Patients were assessed using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification, MG composite score (MGCS), and MG activity of daily living (MGADL) scores at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Statistical analyses included the Spearman correlation, the Friedman test, and ANOVA. Results: Thirty-two patients were enrolled (13 males, mean age 66.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.5 years). Significant improvements in MGADL and MGCS scores were observed at 6 and 12 months (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), with continued improvement over 24 months. Side effects were reported in 12% of patients. MMF showed a faster onset of symptom control compared to azathioprine, with a significant improvement noted within 6 months. Conclusions: A recent study found that MMF and AZA were equally effective in improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, but because AZA had more serious adverse events than MMF, lower doses of AZA were therefore recommended to reduce the adverse events while maintaining efficacy. Conversely, results showed that MMF is effective and well-tolerated in the long-term management of MG, providing faster symptom control and a favorable safety profile. Future prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and explore sex differences in response to MMF treatment.</p>

	<p>Decision-making is a cognitive process involving working memory, executive function, and attention. However, the connectivity of large-scale brain networks during decision-making is not well understood. This is because gaining access to large-scale brain networks in humans is still a novel process. Here, we used SEEG (stereoelectroencephalography) to record neural activity from the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and frontoparietal network (FN) in ten humans while they performed a gambling task in the form of the card game, &amp;amp;ldquo;War&amp;amp;rdquo;. By observing these networks during a decision-making period, we related the activity of and connectivity between these networks. In particular, we found that gamma band activity was directly related to a participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to bet logically, deciding what betting amount would result in the highest monetary gain or lowest monetary loss throughout a session of the game. We also found connectivity between the DAN and the relation to a participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. Specifically, participants with higher connectivity between and within these networks had higher earnings. Our preliminary findings suggest that connectivity and activity between these networks are essential during decision-making.</p>

	<p>Electrophysiological methods of research are widely used in neurobiology. To assess the bioelectrical activity of the brain in small laboratory animals, electrocorticography (ECoG) is most often used, which allows the recording of signals directly from the cerebral cortex. To date, a number of methodological approaches to the manufacture and implantation of ECoG electrodes have been proposed, the complexity of which is determined by experimental tasks and logistical capabilities. Existing methods for analyzing bioelectrical signals are used to assess the functional state of the nervous system in test animals, as well as to identify correlates of pathological changes or pharmacological effects. The review presents current areas of applications of ECoG in neuropharmacological studies in small laboratory animals. Traditionally, this method is actively used to study the antiepileptic activity of new molecules. However, the possibility of using ECoG to assess the neuroprotective activity of drugs in models of traumatic, vascular, metabolic, or neurodegenerative CNS damage remains clearly underestimated. Despite the fact that ECoG has a number of disadvantages and methodological difficulties, the recorded data can be a useful addition to traditional molecular and behavioral research methods. An analysis of the works in recent years indicates a growing interest in the method as a tool for assessing the pharmacological activity of psychoactive drugs, especially in combination with classification and prediction algorithms.</p>

                Background Scientific publishing is a critical part of scientific enquiry; individual excellence is often measured by the number of publications, and the journals in which these publications appeared count enormously. Open Science practices, such as open access, open review, random gatekeeping and shared governance, are implemented in various journals and publishing platforms, providing alternative ways of publishing. But how are these practices trusted? Methods We have created a theoretical framework for trust in the context of academic publishing and investigated to what extent Dutch researchers find these ways of publishing trustworthy. We have performed a survey to compare the trustworthiness of novel and classical ways of publishing and conducted multiple interviews to figure out why scientists find certain publishing practices more attractive than others. Results In the academic publishing system, we have identified various interdependent relationships between stakeholders in which there is a certain level of uncertainty; therefore, we can assume that trust plays a relevant role here. Based on the literature review and interview results, trustworthiness turned out to be one of the most important factors in choosing journals to read relevant scientific discoveries and to publish papers. The survey results suggest that some aspects of open publishing, such as open access, open peer review and shared governance are well-known and widely accepted and trusted amongst the participants, while others, like participatory peer review or random gatekeeping, were less known. In these cases, many researchers formulated concerns about the competence of the randomly assigned gatekeeper and the reviewers coming from the wider community. Conclusions Our results highlight a shift in social norms within the Dutch scientific community, formulating critical voices towards the profit-oriented nature of classical scientific publishing and highlighting the importance of open access to scientific results, supporting open peer review and publishers with shared governance.

                Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a widespread malignancy globally, yet effective therapeutic approaches for advanced, metastatic, and chemo-resistant cases remain limited. In this study, we knocked out CRC cell line HCT 116 for two autophagy genes (ATG5 and ATG7), then we conducted a transcriptomic analysis on those isogenic cell lines. which revealed an upregulation of Krϋppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) expression, that was biologically validated. Methods In this study, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing on HCT 116 followed with transcriptomics analysis on HCT 116 KO cells for ATG5 and ATG7. Various bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate the KLF3/8 with autophagy and affected functional pathways, and immune genes related to the different types. Validation of expression in different cell lines were done using qPCR and Western blot. Results To further investigate the role of autophagy genes in CRC, we utilized publicly available data and web-based tools. Our analysis showed a marked correlation between KLF3/KLF8 and the expression of autophagy genes in CRC, denoting that its upregulation is likely to be a compensatory mechanism. We also examined the co-expression of autophagy genes and KLF3/KLF8 with multiple markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and significant positive correlations were observed. Moreover, KLF8 expression was upregulated at the mRNA level in the metastatic cell lines LoVo and SK-CO-1, compared to HCT 116. Interestingly, KLF3/KLF8 expression was high in MSS molecular subtype of CRC as shown in HCT 116 cell line knocked in with MLH gene as well as they were negatively correlated with crucial immune-infiltrating cells such as CD8+ cells, indicating their potential as a negative biomarker for response to immunotherapy. Conclusion Our study proposes that a synergistic approach involving the inhibition of KLF8 and autophagy holds a potential therapeutic target for effectively tackling metastatic CRC cells, especially in cases characterized by deficient mismatch repair (MMR).

                Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2 (TGM2) is a Ca2+ dependent enzyme that catalyzes transglutaminase cross-linking modifications. TGM2 is involved in various diseases, either in a protective or contributory manner, making it a crucial protein to study and determine its therapeutic potential. Identifying high-performing TGM2 antibodies would facilitate these investigations. Here we have characterized seventeen TGM2 commercial antibodies for western blot and sixteen for immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The implemented standardized experimental protocol is based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines against their isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.
