                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07141">From Understanding Genetic Drift to a Smart-Restart Parameter-less Compact Genetic Algorithm. (arXiv:2004.07141v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>One of the key difficulties in using estimation-of-distribution algorithms is
choosing the population sizes appropriately: Too small values lead to genetic
drift, which can cause enormous difficulties. In the regime with no genetic
drift, however, often the runtime is roughly proportional to the population
size, which renders large population sizes inefficient.
</p>
<p>Based on a recent quantitative analysis which population sizes lead to
genetic drift, we propose a parameter-less version of the compact genetic
algorithm that automatically finds a suitable population size without spending
too much time in situations unfavorable due to genetic drift.
</p>
<p>We prove an easy mathematical runtime guarantee for this algorithm and
conduct an extensive experimental analysis on four classic benchmark problems.
The former shows that under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a
performance similar to the one obtainable from the best population size. The
latter confirms that missing the right population size can be highly
detrimental and shows that our algorithm as well as a previously proposed
parameter-less one based on parallel runs avoids such pitfalls. Comparing the
two approaches, ours profits from its ability to abort runs which are likely to
be stuck in a genetic drift situation.

<p>The neural network needs excessive costs of time because of the complexity of
architecture when trained on images. Transfer learning and fine-tuning can help
improve time and cost efficiency when training a neural network. Yet, Transfer
learning and fine-tuning needs a lot of experiment to try with. Therefore, a
method to find the best architecture for transfer learning and fine-tuning is
needed. To overcome this problem, neuro-evolution using a genetic algorithm can
be used to find the best architecture for transfer learning. To check the
performance of this study, dataset ChestX-Ray 14 and DenseNet-121 as a base
neural network model are used. This study used the AUC score, differences in
execution time for training, and McNemar's test to the significance test. In
terms of result, this study got a 5% difference in the AUC score, 3 % faster in
terms of execution time, and significance in most of the disease detection.
Finally, this study gives a concrete summary of how neuro-evolution transfer
learning can help in terms of transfer learning and fine-tuning.

<p>Neural networks excel at approximating functions and finding patterns in
complex and challenging domains. Yet, they fail to learn simple but precise
computation. Recent work addressed the ability to add, subtract, and multiply
numbers but is lacking a component to drive control flow. True computer
intelligence should also be able to decide when to perform what operation. In
this paper, we introduce the Neural Status Register (NSR), inspired by physical
Status Registers. At the heart of the NSR are arithmetic comparisons between
inputs. With theoretically principled changes to physical Status Registers, the
NSR allows end-to-end differentiation and learns such comparisons reliably. But
the NSR also extrapolates: it generalizes to unseen data distributions. For
example, the NSR trains on single digits and correctly predicts numbers that
are up to 14 orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that the NSR captures
the true underlying arithmetic. In follow-up experiments, we use the NSR to
control the computation of a downstream arithmetic unit to learn piecewise
functions. We can also learn more challenging tasks through redundancy.
Finally, we use the NSR to learn an upstream convolutional neural network to
compare images of MNIST digits to decide which image contains the larger digit.

<p>This paper intends to understand and to improve the working principle of
decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We review the
design of the well-established Moea/d framework to support the smooth
integration of different strategies for sub-problem selection, while
emphasizing the role of the population size and of the number of offspring
created at each generation. By conducting a comprehensive empirical analysis on
a wide range of multi-and many-objective combinatorial NK landscapes, we
provide new insights into the combined effect of those parameters on the
anytime performance of the underlying search process. In particular, we show
that even a simple random strategy selecting sub-problems at random outperforms
existing sophisticated strategies. We also study the sensitivity of such
strategies with respect to the ruggedness and the objective space dimension of
the target problem.

<p>Given a point in m-dimensional objective space, the local environment of a
point can be partitioned into the incomparable, the dominated and the
dominating region. The ratio between the size of the incomparable region, and
the dominated (and dominating) decreases proportionally to $1/2^{m-1}$. Due to
this reason, it gets increasingly unlikely that dominating points can be found
by random, isotropic mutations. As a remedy to stagnation of search in many
objective optimization, in this paper, we suggest to enhance the Pareto
dominance order by involving a convex obtuse dominance cone in the convergence
phase of an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The approach is integrated in
several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and
tested on benchmark problems with four, five, six and eight objectives.
Computational experiments demonstrate the ability of the expanded cone
technique to improve the performance of MOEAs on many-objective optimization
problems.

<p>Hyperspectral Imaging is the acquisition of spectral and spatial information
of a particular scene. Capturing such information from a specialized
hyperspectral camera remains costly. Reconstructing such information from the
RGB image achieves a better solution in both classification and object
recognition tasks. This work proposes a novel light weight network with very
less number of parameters about 233,059 parameters based on Residual dense
model with attention mechanism to obtain this solution. This network uses
Coordination Convolutional Block to get the spatial information. The weights
from this block are shared by two independent feature extraction mechanisms,
one by dense feature extraction and the other by the multiscale hierarchical
feature extraction. Finally, the features from both the feature extraction
mechanisms are globally fused to produce the 31 spectral bands. The network is
trained with NTIRE 2020 challenge dataset and thus achieved 0.0457 MRAE metric
value with less computational complexity.

<p>A bottleneck in any evolutionary art system is aesthetic evaluation. Many
different methods have been proposed to automate the evaluation of aesthetics,
including measures of symmetry, coherence, complexity, contrast and grouping.
The interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) relies on human-in-the-loop, subjective
evaluation of aesthetics, but limits possibilities for large search due to user
fatigue and small population sizes. In this paper we look at how recent
advances in deep learning can assist in automating personal aesthetic
judgement. Using a leading artist's computer art dataset, we use dimensionality
reduction methods to visualise both genotype and phenotype space in order to
support the exploration of new territory in any generative system.
Convolutional Neural Networks trained on the user's prior aesthetic evaluations
are used to suggest new possibilities similar or between known high quality
genotype-phenotype mappings.

<p>The purpose of this study is to develop a new methodology for designing
stimulus sequences for cVEP BCI based on experimental studies regarding the
behavior and the properties of the actual EEG responses of the visual system to
coded visual stimuli, such that training time is reduced and the possible
number of targets is increased. EEG from 8 occipital sites is recorded with
2000 samples/sec per channel, in response to visual stimuli presented on a
computer monitor with 60Hz refresh rate. Onset and offset EEG responses to long
visual stimulus pulses are obtained through 160-trial signal averaging. These
edge responses are used to predict the EEG responses to arbitrary stimulus
sequences using the superposition principle. A BCI speller which utilizes the
target templates generated by this principle is also implemented and tested. It
is found that certain short stimulus patterns can be accurately predicted by
the superposition principle. BCI sequences that are constructed by combinations
of these optimal patterns yield higher accuracy (95.9%) and ITR (57.2 bpm)
compared to when the superposition principle is applied to conventional
m-sequences and randomly generated sequences. Training time for the BCI
application involves only the acquisition of the edge responses and is less
than 4 minutes, and a huge number of sequences is possible. This is the first
study in which cVEP BCI sequences are designed based on constraints obtained by
observing the actual brain responses to several stimulus patterns.

Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms maintain homeostasis of essential elements, and are believed to be highly time-variant. However, current approaches measure elemental biomarkers at a few discrete time-points, ignoring complex higher-order dynamical features. To study dynamical properties of elemental homeostasis, we apply laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to tooth samples to generate 500 temporally sequential measurements of elemental concentrations from birth to 10 years. We applied dynamical system and Information Theory-based analyses to reveal the longest-known attractor system in mammalian biology underlying the metabolism of nutrient elements, and identify distinct and consistent transitions between stable and unstable states throughout development. Extending these dynamical features to disease prediction, we find that attractor topography of nutrient metabolism is altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as early as childhood, suggesting these pathways are involved in disease risk. Mechanistic analysis was undertaken in a transgenic mouse model of ALS, where we find similar marked disruptions in elemental attractor systems as in humans. Our results demonstrate the application of a phenomological analysis of dynamical systems underlying elemental metabolism, and emphasize the utility of these measures in characterizing risk of disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c5YPoxjUguA" width="1" />

<p>Songbirds are a powerful model to study vocal learning given that aspects of the underlying behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms are analogous in many ways to mechanisms involved in speech learning. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) represent one of the mechanisms controlling the closing of sensitive periods for vocal learning in the songbird brain. In zebra finches, PNN develop around parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in selected song control nuclei during ontogeny and their development is delayed if juveniles are deprived of a tutor. However, song learning in zebra finches takes place during a relatively short period of development, and it is difficult to determine whether PNN development correlates with the end of the sensory or the sensorimotor learning period. Canaries have a longer period of sensorimotor vocal learning, spanning over their first year of life so that it should be easier to test whether PNN development correlates with the end of sensory or sensorimotor vocal learning. Here, we quantified PNN around PV-interneurons in the brain of male canaries from hatching until the first breeding season and analyzed in parallel the development of their song. PNN development around PV-interneurons specifically took place and their number reached its maximum around the end of the sensorimotor learning stage, well after the end of sensory vocal learning, and correlated with song development. This suggests that PNN are specifically involved in the termination of the sensitive period for sensorimotor vocal learning.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The mechanisms by which antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) cause birth defects (BDs) are unknown. Data suggest that AED‐induced BDs may result from a genome‐wide increase of de novo variants in the embryo, a mechanism that we investigated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing data from child–parent trios were interrogated for de novo single‐nucleotide variants/indels (dnSNVs/indels) and de novo copy number variants (dnCNVs). Generalized linear models were applied to assess de novo variant burdens in children exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐exposed children) versus children without BDs not exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐unexposed unaffected children), and AED‐exposed children with BDs versus those without BDs, adjusting for confounders. Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixty‐seven child–parent trios were included: 10 with AED‐exposed children with BDs, 46 with AED‐exposed unaffected children, and 11 with AED‐unexposed unaffected children. The dnSNV/indel burden did not differ between AED‐exposed children and AED‐unexposed unaffected children (median dnSNV/indel number/child [range] = 3 [0–7] vs 3 [1–5], <i>p</i> = 0.50). Among AED‐exposed children, there were no significant differences between those with BDs and those unaffected. Likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels were detected in 9 of 67 (13%) children, none of whom had BDs. The proportion of cases harboring likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels did not differ significantly between AED‐unexposed and AED‐exposed children. The dnCNV burden was not associated with AED exposure or birth outcome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study indicates that prenatal AED exposure does not increase the burden of de novo variants, and that this mechanism is not a major contributor to AED‐induced BDs. These results can be incorporated in routine patient counseling. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE) is partly due to CNS hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in two MS models.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A variety of methods have been employed to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function and tissue perfusion in EAE.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE, and a model of the early MS lesion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE and the model early MS lesion, appear to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function, but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.</p>

<p>The $(1 + (\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm is a recent invention of the
theory community. Rigorous runtime analyses on unimodal fitness functions
showed that it can indeed be faster than classical evolutionary algorithms,
though on these simple problems the gains were only moderate.
</p>
<p>In this work, we conduct the first runtime analysis of this algorithm on a
multimodal problem class, the jump functions benchmark. We show that with the
right parameters, the $(1 + (\lambda,\lambda))$ GA optimizes any jump function
with jump size $2 \le k \le n/16$ in expected time $O(n^{(k+1)/2} e^{O(k)}
k^{-k/2})$, which significantly and already for constant $k$ outperforms
standard mutation-based algorithms with their $\Theta(n^k)$ runtime and
standard crossover-based algorithms with their $O(n^{k-1})$ runtime.
</p>
<p>Our work suggests some general advice on how to set the parameters of the $(1
+ (\lambda,\lambda))$, which might ease the further use of this algorithm.

<p>The big problem for neural network models which are trained to count
instances is that whenever test range goes high training range generalization
error increases i.e. they are not good generalizers outside training range.
Consider the case of automating cell counting process where more dense images
with higher cell counts are commonly encountered as compared to images used in
training data. By making better predictions for higher ranges of cell count we
are aiming to create better generalization systems for cell counting. With
architecture proposal of neural arithmetic logic units (NALU) for arithmetic
operations, task of counting has become feasible for higher numeric ranges
which were not included in training data with better accuracy. As a part of our
study we used these units and different other activation functions for learning
cell counting task with two different architectures namely Fully Convolutional
Regression Network and U-Net. These numerically biased units are added in the
form of residual concatenated layers to original architectures and a
comparative experimental study is done with these newly proposed changes . This
comparative study is described in terms of optimizing regression loss problem
from these models trained with extensive data augmentation techniques. We were
able to achieve better results in our experiments of cell counting tasks with
introduction of these numerically biased units to already existing
architectures in the form of residual layer concatenation connections. Our
results confirm that above stated numerically biased units does help models to
learn numeric quantities for better generalization results.

<p>In artificial neural network, the activation function and the weight
initialization method play important roles in training and performance of a
neural network. The question arises is what properties of a function are
important/necessary for being a well-performing activation function. Also, the
most widely used weight initialization methods - Xavier and He normal
initialization have fundamental connection with activation function. This
survey discusses the important/necessary properties of activation function and
the most widely used activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LReLU and
PReLU). This survey also explores the relationship between these activation
functions and the two weight initialization methods - Xavier and He normal
initialization.

<p>The weight maximization problem (WMP) is the problem of finding the word of
highest weight on a weighted finite state automaton (WFA). It is an essential
question that emerges in many optimization problems in automata theory.
Unfortunately, the general problem can be shown to be undecidable, whereas its
bounded decisional version is NP-complete. Designing efficient algorithms that
produce approximate solutions to the WMP in reasonable time is an appealing
research direction that can lead to several new applications including formal
verification of systems abstracted as WFAs. In particular, in combination with
a recent procedure that translates a recurrent neural network into a weighted
automaton, an algorithm for the WMP can be used to analyze and verify the
network by exploiting the simpler and more compact automata model. In this
work, we propose, implement and evaluate a metaheuristic based on genetic
algorithms to approximate solutions to the WMP. We experimentally evaluate its
performance on examples from the literature and show its potential on different
applications.

<p>A customized multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is proposed for
the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). It uses smart
initialization approaches to enrich the first generated population, and
proposes various crossover operators to create a better diversity of offspring.
Especially, the MIP-EGO configurator, which can tune algorithm parameters, is
adopted to automatically tune operator probabilities. Furthermore, different
local search strategies are employed to explore the neighborhood for better
solutions. In general, the algorithm enhancement strategy can be integrated
with any standard EMO algorithm. In this paper, it has been combined with
NSGA-III to solve benchmark multi-objective FJSPs, whereas an off-the-shelf
implementation of NSGA-III is not capable of solving the FJSP. The experimental
results show excellent performance with less computing budget.

<p>The emerging research paradigm coined as multitasking optimization aims to
solve multiple optimization tasks concurrently by means of a single search
process. For this purpose, the exploitation of complementarities among the
tasks to be solved is crucial, which is often achieved via the transfer of
genetic material, thereby forging the Transfer Optimization field. In this
context, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses this paradigm by resorting to
concepts from Evolutionary Computation. Within this specific branch, approaches
such as the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has lately gained a
notable momentum when tackling multiple optimization tasks. This work
contributes to this trend by proposing the first adaptation of the recently
introduced Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm II (MFEA-II) to
permutation-based discrete optimization environments. For modeling this
adaptation, some concepts cannot be directly applied to discrete search spaces,
such as parent-centric interactions. In this paper we entirely reformulate such
concepts, making them suited to deal with permutation-based search spaces
without loosing the inherent benefits of MFEA-II. The performance of the
proposed solver has been assessed over 5 different multitasking setups,
composed by 8 datasets of the well-known Traveling Salesman (TSP) and
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP). The obtained results and their
comparison to those by the discrete version of the MFEA confirm the good
performance of the developed dMFEA-II, and concur with the insights drawn in
previous studies for continuous optimization.

<p>The heavy-tailed mutation operator proposed in Doerr et al. (GECCO 2017),
called fast mutation to agree with the previously used language, so far was
successfully used only in purely mutation-based algorithms. There, it can
relieve the algorithm designer from finding the optimal mutation rate and
nevertheless obtain a performance close to the one that the optimal mutation
rate gives.
</p>
<p>In this first runtime analysis of a crossover-based algorithm using a
heavy-tailed choice of the mutation rate, we show an even stronger impact. With
a heavy-tailed mutation rate, the runtime of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$
genetic algorithm on the OneMax benchmark function becomes linear in the
problem size. This is asymptotically faster than with any static mutation rate
and is the same asymptotic runtime that can be obtained with a self-adjusting
choice of the mutation rate. This result is complemented by an empirical study
which shows the effectiveness of the fast mutation also on random MAX-3SAT
instances.

<p>Benchmarks are a useful tool for empirical performance comparisons. However,
one of the main shortcomings of existing benchmarks is that it remains largely
unclear how they relate to real-world problems. What does an algorithm's
performance on a benchmark say about its potential on a specific real-world
problem? This work aims to identify properties of real-world problems through a
questionnaire on real-world single-, multi-, and many-objective optimization
problems. Based on initial responses, a few challenges that have to be
considered in the design of realistic benchmarks can already be identified. A
key point for future work is to gather more responses to the questionnaire to
allow an analysis of common combinations of properties. In turn, such common
combinations can then be included in improved benchmark suites. To gather more
data, the reader is invited to participate in the questionnaire at:

<p>The existing real time object detection algorithm is based on the deep neural
network of convolution need to perform multilevel convolution and pooling
operations on the entire image to extract a deep semantic characteristic of the
image. The detection models perform better for large objects. However, these
models do not detect small objects with low resolution and noise, because the
features of existing models do not fully represent the essential features of
small objects after repeated convolution operations. We have introduced a novel
real time detection algorithm which employs upsampling and skip connection to
extract multiscale features at different convolution levels in a learning task
resulting a remarkable performance in detecting small objects. The detection
precision of the model is shown to be higher and faster than that of the
state-of-the-art models.

<p>Advances in Data Science permeate every field of Transportation Science and
Engineering, making it straightforward to imagine that developments in the
transportation sector will be data-driven. Nowadays, Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) could be arguably approached as a "story" intensively producing
and consuming large amounts of data. A diversity of sensing devices densely
spread over the infrastructure, vehicles or the travelers' personal devices act
as sources of data flows that are eventually fed to software running on
automatic devices, actuators or control systems producing, in turn, complex
information flows between users, traffic managers, data analysts, traffic
modeling scientists, etc. These information flows provide enormous
opportunities to improve model development and decision-making. This work aims
to describe how data, coming from diverse ITS sources, can be used to learn and
adapt data-driven models for efficiently operating ITS assets, systems and
processes; in other words, for data-based models to fully become actionable.
Grounded on this described data modeling pipeline for ITS, we define the
characteristics, engineering requisites and challenges intrinsic to its three
compounding stages, namely, data fusion, adaptive learning and model
evaluation. We deliberately generalize model learning to be adaptive, since, in
the core of our paper is the firm conviction that most learners will have to
adapt to the ever-changing phenomenon scenario underlying the majority of ITS
applications. Finally, we provide a prospect of current research lines within
Data Science that can bring notable advances to data-based ITS modeling, which
will eventually bridge the gap towards the practicality and actionability of
such models.

<p>In psychiatry, we often speak of constructing "models." Here we try to make
sense of what such a claim might mean, starting with the most fundamental
question: "What is (and isn't) a model?". We then discuss, in a concrete
measurable sense, what it means for a model to be useful. In so doing, we first
identify the added value that a computational model can provide, in the context
of accuracy and power. We then present the limitations of standard statistical
methods and provide suggestions for how we can expand the explanatory power of
our analyses by reconceptualizing statistical models as dynamical systems.
Finally, we address the problem of model building, suggesting ways in which
computational psychiatry can escape the potential for cognitive biases imposed
by classical hypothesis-driven research, exploiting deep systems-level
information contained within neuroimaging data to advance our understanding of
psychiatric neuroscience.

<p>Recent whole brain imaging experiments on $\textit{C. elegans}$ has revealed
that the neural population dynamics encode motor commands and stereotyped
transitions between behaviors on low dimensional manifolds. Efforts to
characterize the dynamics on this manifold have used piecewise linear models to
describe the entire state space, but it is unknown how a single, global
dynamical model can generate the observed dynamics. Here, we propose a control
framework to achieve such a global model of the dynamics, whereby underlying
linear dynamics is actuated by sparse control signals. This method learns the
control signals in an unsupervised way from data, then uses $\textit{ Dynamic
Mode Decomposition with control}$ (DMDc) to create the first global, linear
dynamical system that can reconstruct whole-brain imaging data. These control
signals are shown to be implicated in transitions between behaviors. In
addition, we analyze the time-delay encoding of these control signals, showing
that these transitions can be predicted from neurons previously implicated in
behavioral transitions, but also additional neurons previously unidentified.
Moreover, our decomposition method allows one to understand the observed
nonlinear global dynamics instead as linear dynamics with control. The proposed
mathematical framework is generic and can be generalized to other neurosensory
systems, potentially revealing transitions and their encodings in a completely
unsupervised way.

<p>In this paper we present the Neuron Module that we implemented within the
Matlab-based diffusion MRI simulation toolbox SpinDoctor. SpinDoctor uses
finite element discretization and adaptive time integration to solve the
Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation for general diffusion-encoding
sequences, at multiple b-values and in multiple diffusion directions. In order
to facilitate the diffusion MRI simulation of realistic neurons by the research
community, we constructed finite element meshes for a group of 36 pyramidal
neurons and a group of 29 spindle neurons whose morphological descriptions were
found in the publicly available neuron repository NeuroMorpho.Org. We also
broke the neurons into the soma and dendrite branches and created finite
elements meshes for these cell components. Through the Neuron Module, these
neuron and cell components finite element meshes can be seamlessly coupled with
the functionalities of SpinDoctor. To illustrate some potential uses of the
Neuron Module, we show numerical examples of the simulated diffusion MRI
signals in multiple diffusion directions from whole neurons as well as from the
soma and dendrite branches, and include a comparison of the high b-value
behavior between dendrite branches and whole neurons. In addition, we
demonstrate that the neuron meshes can be used to perform Monte-Carlo diffusion
MRI simulations as well. We show that at equivalent accuracy, if only one
gradient direction needs to be simulated, SpinDoctor is faster than a GPU
implementation of Monte-Carlo. Finally, we numerically compute the
eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the Bloch-Torrey and the Laplace
operators on the neuron geometries using a finite elements discretization, in
order to give guidance in the choice of the space and time discretization
parameters for both finite elements and Monte-Carlo approaches.

<p>Drawing an inspiration from behavioral studies of human decision making, we
propose here a more general and flexible parametric framework for reinforcement
learning that extends standard Q-learning to a two-stream model for processing
positive and negative rewards, and allows to incorporate a wide range of
reward-processing biases -- an important component of human decision making
which can help us better understand a wide spectrum of multi-agent interactions
in complex real-world socioeconomic systems, as well as various
neuropsychiatric conditions associated with disruptions in normal reward
processing. From the computational perspective, we observe that the proposed
Split-QL model and its clinically inspired variants consistently outperform
standard Q-Learning and SARSA methods, as well as recently proposed Double
Q-Learning approaches, on simulated tasks with particular reward distributions,
a real-world dataset capturing human decision-making in gambling tasks, and the
Pac-Man game in a lifelong learning setting across different reward
stationarities.

<p>There are several technical challenges to obtaining high-quality recordings of cochlear potentials in human electrocochleography (ECochG). These challenges include electrical artifacts from devices such as acoustic transducers, biological artifacts from excessive myogenic and electroencephalographic potentials, and issues associated with the placement of a tympanic membrane (TM) electrode on the eardrum. This article presents approaches for dealing with these challenges for ECochG measurement using a TM electrode. Emphasis is placed on eliminating stimulus artifact, optimizing the placement of the electrode, and comparing a custom-made electrode with a commercially-available electrode. This comparison revealed that the custom-made electrode results in greater subject comfort, superior ease of placing the electrode on the eardrum, and larger compound action potential (CAP) amplitudes.</p>

<p>Lysophospholipids (LPLs) are bioactive signaling lipids that are generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane phospholipids (PLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are two of the best-characterized LPLs which mediate a variety of cellular physiological responses via specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mediated signaling pathways. Considerable evidence now demonstrates the crucial role of LPA and S1P in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dysfunction of LPA and S1P metabolism can lead to aberrant accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation and ultimately neuronal death. Summarizing LPA and S1P signaling profile may aid in profound health and pathological processes. In the current review, we will introduce the metabolism as well as the physiological roles of LPA and S1P in maintaining the normal functions of the nervous system. Given these pivotal functions, we will further discuss the role of dysregulation of LPA and S1P in promoting AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of diseases caused by chronic and progressive degeneration of neural tissue. The main pathological manifestations are neuronal degeneration and loss in the brain and/or spinal cord. Common NDDs include Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complicated pathological characteristics and different clinical manifestations of NDDs result in a lack of sensitive and efficient diagnostic methods. In addition, no sensitive biomarkers are available to monitor the course of NDDs, predict their prognosis, and monitor the therapeutic response. Despite extensive research in recent years, analysis of amyloid β (Aβ) and α-synuclein has failed to effectively improve NDD diagnosis. Although recent studies have indicated circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs, the miRNA in the peripheral circulation is susceptible to interference by other components, making circulating miRNA results less consistent. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with a diameter of approximately 30–100 nm that transport proteins, lipids, mRNA, and miRNA. Because recent studies have shown that exosomes have a double-membrane structure that can resist ribonuclease in the blood, giving exosomal miRNA high stability and making them resistant to degradation, they may become an ideal biomarker of circulating fluids. In this review, we discuss the applicability of circulating exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers, highlight the technical aspects of exosomal miRNA analysis, and review studies that have used circulating exosomal miRNAs as candidate diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs.</p>

Background<p>Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease with antithrombotic effects, protects in animal models of ischemic stroke by suppressing inflammation and enhancing vascular integrity, angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neuroprotection. A small number of animal studies suggest it might also have therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis (MS), though results have been mixed. Based on these conflicting data, the goals of this study were to clarify the therapeutic potential of APC in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS and to determine mechanistically how APC mediates this protective effect.</p>Methods<p>The protective potential of APC was examined in a chronic progressive model of EAE. Vascular breakdown, tight junction protein expression and vascular expression of fibronectin and α5β1 integrin as well as vascularity and glial activation were analyzed using immunofluorescence (IF) of spinal cord sections taken from mice with established EAE. The direct influence of APC on microglial activation was evaluated in vitro by a combination of morphology and MMP-9 expression.</p>Results<p>APC attenuated the progression of EAE, and this was strongly associated at the histopathological level with reduced levels of leukocyte infiltration and concomitant demyelination. Further analysis revealed that APC reduced vascular breakdown which was associated with maintained endothelial expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). In addition, APC suppressed microglial activation in this EAE model and in vitro studies revealed that APC strongly inhibited microglial activation at both the morphological level and by the expression of the pro-inflammatory protease MMP-9.</p>Conclusion<p>These findings build on the work of others in demonstrating strong therapeutic potential for APC in the treatment of inflammatory demyelinating disease and suggest that enhancement of vascular integrity and suppression of microglial activation may be important mediators of this protection.</p>

<p>Mapping the cytoarchitecture of the whole brain can reveal the organizational logic of neural systems. However, this remains a significant challenge, especially for gyrencephalic brains with a large volume. Here we propose an integrated pipeline for generating a cytoarchitectonic atlas with single-cell resolution of the whole brain. To analyze a large-volume brain, we used a modified en-bloc Nissl staining protocol to achieve uniform staining of large-scale brain specimens from ferret (Mustela putorius furo). By combining whole-brain imaging and big data processing, we established strategies for parsing cytoarchitectural information at a voxel resolution of 0.33 μm × 0.33 μm × 1 μm and terabyte-scale data analysis. Using the cytoarchitectonic datasets for adult ferret brain, we identified giant pyramidal neurons in ferret brains and provide the first report of their morphological diversity, neurochemical phenotype, and distribution patterns in the whole brain in three dimensions. This pipeline will facilitate studies on the organization and development of the mammalian brains, from that of rodents to the gyrencephalic brains of ferret and even primates.</p>

<p>Independent component analysis (ICA), being a data-driven method, has been shown to be a powerful tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. One drawback of this multivariate approach is that it is not, in general, compatible with the analysis of group data. Various techniques have been proposed to overcome this limitation of ICA. In this paper, a novel ICA-based workflow for extracting resting-state networks from fMRI group studies is proposed. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used, in a data-driven manner, to generate reference signals that can be incorporated into a constrained version of ICA (cICA), thereby eliminating the inherent ambiguities of ICA. The results of the proposed workflow are then compared to those obtained by a widely used group ICA approach for fMRI analysis. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic modes, extracted by EMD, are suitable to serve as references for cICA. This approach yields typical resting-state patterns that are consistent over subjects. By introducing these reference signals into the ICA, our processing pipeline yields comparable activity patterns across subjects in a mathematically transparent manner. Our approach provides a user-friendly tool to adjust the trade-off between a high similarity across subjects and preserving individual subject features of the independent components.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00140">Cue Valence Influences the Effects of Cue Uncertainty on ERP Responses to Emotional Events</a></h4>

<p>Individuals often predict consequences, particularly emotional consequences, according to emotional or non-emotional signals conveyed by environmental cues (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues, respectively). Some of these cues signify the consequences with certainty (i.e., certain cues), whereas others do not (i.e., uncertain cues). Several event-related potential (ERP) studies regarding non-emotional cues have suggested that the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events occur in both perception and evaluation processes. However, due to the limitations of previous studies, it is unclear what the effects of cue uncertainty would be in an emotional cue condition. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the effects of cue uncertainty are affected by cue valence (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues). To address these questions, we asked participants to view cues and then to view emotional (positive or negative) pictures. The cues either did or did not indicate the emotional content of the picture. In the emotional cue condition, happy and fearful faces were used as certain cues indicating upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and neutral faces were used as uncertain cues. In the non-emotional cue condition, scrambled faces outlined in red and blue indicated upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and scrambled faces outlined in green served as uncertain cues. The results showed that for negative pictures, ERP responses in a time range between 60 and 1,000 ms were shifted to a more negative direction in a certain condition than in the uncertain condition when the cues were emotional. However, the effect was the reverse for positive pictures. This effect of cue uncertainty was similar in the non-emotional cue—negative condition. In contrast, there was no effect of cue uncertainty in the non-emotional cue—positive condition. Therefore, the findings indicate that cue uncertainty modulates attention toward emotional events when the events are signified by emotional cues. The findings may also suggest that cue valence modulates the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events.</p>

<p>Background: Abacus experts could mentally calculate fast some mathematical operations using multi-digit numbers. The temporal dynamics of abacus mental calculation are still unknown although some behavioral and neuroimaging studies have suggested a visuospatial and visuomotor neural process during abacus mental calculation. Therefore, this contribution aims to clarify the significant similarities and the differences between experts and novices by investigating calculation-induced neuromagnetic responses based on cerebral oscillatory changes.</p><p>Methods: Twelve to 13 healthy abacus experts and 17 non-experts participated in two experimental paradigms using non-invasive neuromagnetic measurements. In experiments 1 and 2, the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes presented mental calculations and temporal frequency profiles during addition while examining multiplication tasks. The MEG data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) with an adaptive beamformer to calculate the group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes and their temporal frequency profiles in source-level analyses.</p><p>Results: Using a group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes, we observed some common brain activities in both right-handed abacus experts and non-experts. In non-experts, we detected the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); whereas in experts, detected the bilateral parieto-occipital sulcus (POS), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left sensorimotor areas mainly. Based on the findings generated, we could propose calculation processing models for both abacus experts and non- experts conveniently.</p><p>Conclusion: The proposed model of calculation processing in abacus experts and novices revealed that the novices could calculate logically depending on numerical processing in the left IPS. In contrast, abacus experts are utilizing spatial processing using a memorized imaginary abacus, which distributed over the bilateral hemispheres in the IFG and sensorimotor areas.</p>

<p>The theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to others and is extremely important for social functioning. It has been widely examined in both behavioral and neuroimaging research, usually with the use of the many versions of the false-belief (FB) task. However, there is still not enough evidence from studies on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ToM mostly because of methodological limitations: lack of selectivity, mismatch of experimental and control tasks, and focusing on participants older than 6 years old. In the current study, we attempted to develop a computerized tool for ToM assessment suitable for both behavioral and neuriomaging testing in preschoolers. We designed a version of the classic change-of-location task with custom visuals and three fine-tuned conditions: FB, true-belief, and no-belief (NB). The usability of the task for further application in neurodevelopmental research was tested with three methods: first, behaviorally, with the use of a touch screen on a group of 75 children, followed by a functional MRI (fMRI) study on 13 adults, and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on 19 preschool children. In line with our expectations, on the behavioral level, our task elicited the all-or-none performance in preschoolers. There was also a progression of performance with age in the FB condition. On the neural level, we observed the activation of structures involved in the ToM brain network in response to our task in both adults and children. The results therefore suggest that our task can be a useful tool for studying ToM development and its neural underpinnings.</p>

<p>“Locked-in” patients lose their ability to communicate naturally due to motor system dysfunction. Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for “yes” and spatial navigation for “no”) and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a “yes” and “no” answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants’ answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants’ physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (r = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only.</p>

<p>Initially developed to generate new treatments for epilepsy, gabapentin, and pregabalin (“gabapentinoids”) were engineered to mimic the action of GABA and to modulate GABA metabolism. Rather than their intended pharmacological action on GABA neurotransmission, instead, they exhibit a high affinity for the α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels, wherein binding of gabapentinoids inhibits cellular calcium influx and attenuates neurotransmission. Despite a lack of activity on GABA levels, gabapentin and pregabalin are effective at suppressing seizures and subsequently approved as a new class of antiepileptic therapy for partial-onset epilepsy. Through the same hypothesized molecular mechanism and by controlling neuronal hyperexcitability, gabapentinoids demonstrate clear efficacy in pain management, which has arguably been their most extensively prescribed application to date. In this review, we focus on pregabalin as a second-generation gabapentinoid widely employed in the treatment of a variety of pain conditions. We also discuss the wider functional roles of α2δ subunits and the contributions that pregabalin might play in affecting physiological and pathophysiological processes.</p>

<p>Using behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular methods, lots of studies reveal that depression is closely related to the abnormal neural plasticity processes occurring in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Meanwhile, functions of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the other neurotrophins in the pathogenesis of depression are well known. The maladaptive neuroplastic in depression may be related to alterations in the levels of neurotrophic factors, which play a central role in plasticity. Enhancement of neurotrophic factors signaling has great potential in therapy for depression. This review highlights the relevance of neurotrophic factors mediated neural plasticity and pathophysiology of depression. These studies reviewed here may suggest new possible targets for antidepressant drugs such as neurotrophins, their receptors, and relevant signaling pathways, and agents facilitating the activation of gene expression and increasing the transcription of neurotrophic factors in the brain.</p>

<p>The structure of the human brain has been studied extensively. Despite all the knowledge accrued, direct information about connections, from origin to termination, in the human brain is extremely limited. Yet there is a widespread misperception that human connectional neuroanatomy is well-established and validated. In this article, we consider what is known directly about human structural and connectional neuroanatomy. Information on neuroanatomical connections in the human brain is derived largely from studies in non-human experimental models in which the entire connectional pathway, including origins, course, and terminations, is directly visualized. Techniques to examine structural connectivity in the human brain are progressing rapidly; nevertheless, our present understanding of such connectivity is limited largely to data derived from homological comparisons, particularly with non-human primates. We take the position that an in-depth and more precise understanding of human connectional neuroanatomy will be obtained by a systematic application of this homological approach.</p>

<p>In this review article, we will describe the recent advances made towards understanding the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. New evidence indicates that electrical synapses, which are gap junctions between neurons, can have complex molecular compositions including protein asymmetries across joined cells, diverse morphological arrangements, and overlooked similarities with other junctions, all of which indicate new potential roles in neurodevelopmental disease. Aquatic organisms, and in particular the vertebrate zebrafish, have proven to be excellent models for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. Zebrafish will serve as our main exemplar throughout this review and will be compared with other model organisms. We highlight the known cell biological processes that build neuronal gap junctions and compare these with the assemblies of adherens junctions, tight junctions, non-neuronal gap junctions, and chemical synapses to explore the unknown frontiers remaining in our understanding of the critical and ubiquitous electrical synapse.</p>

Objective<p>Currently, most models of vascular cognitive impairment are established by occluding the carotid arteries uni- or bilaterally to reduce the cerebral blood flow mimicking chronic cerebral hypoxia. Due to the sudden blood flow interruption, a gradual narrowing of the carotid artery cannot be completely imitated. This paper aims to establish a bilateral carotid stenosis model with mild cognitive dysfunction and mild white matter changes to simulate patients with vascular predementia.</p>Methods<p>Aged Wistar rats (18 months old) underwent either bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) or occlusion (BCAO) surgery or a sham operation (control group). The cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex was measured using Doppler flowmetry. Thirty days after surgery, cognitive function impairments were determined with the Morris water maze; cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed to detect changes in fractional anisotropy to assess white matter injuries, and histological studies were performed.</p>Results<p>The aged rats in the BCAS group showed a more gradual cerebral blood flow reduction and a lower mortality rate (11%) compared to rats in the BCAO group. The water maze test revealed a more marginal impairment affecting spatial learning and memory in rats with BCAS than in rats with BCAO. Diffusion tensor imaging detected white matter injuries in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of BCAS rats. Particularly, a small portion of nerve fibers of the lateral somatosensory cortex was significantly different between rats of the BCAO and BCAS groups. In the BCAS group, the microscopic structure of the hippocampal CA1 region changed slightly after 30 days and sustained a slight mitochondrial crista crack. Fluorescence staining indicated that the number of GFAP-positive cells was increased in rat brains of the BCAS group, and this phenomenon was even more pronounced in the BCAO group. The hnRNPA2/B1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-α1 expression levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats with BCAS compared to those of controls.</p>Conclusion<p>Severe bilateral carotid stenosis induced mild cognitive dysfunction and slight structural changes in the brains of aged rats. Thus, a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model was successfully established.</p>

<p>Hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, but the causal link remains undetermined. Although astrocytes and microglia play an important role in maintaining the neurovascular unit, astrocytes and microglia have been understudied in comorbid models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In this study, male transgenic Fischer 344 rats (TgAPP21) overexpressing a pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein received 8 weeks of Angiotensin II infusion to increase blood pressure, and the rats were evaluated for astrocytosis, microgliosis, and cognitive function. A linear relationship between astrocytosis and blood pressure was observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum of wildtype rats, with hypertensive wildtype rats matching the elevated baseline astrocytosis seen in normotensive transgenic rats. In contrast, hypertensive transgenic rats did not demonstrate a further increase of astrocytosis, suggesting a deficient response. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect activation of microglia, which were elevated in the white matter and hippocampus of transgenic rats. Angiotensin II infusion did impair both wildtype and transgenic rats’ executive functions in the Morris Water Maze. These results present important implications for the interaction between hypertension and pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein expression, as Angiotensin II infusion produced cognitive impairments in both genotypes, but transgenic rats were additionally impaired in developing a normal astrocytic response to elevated blood pressure.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55111">Cortical anchoring of the microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for neuron polarity</a></h4>

The development of a polarized neuron relies on the selective transport of proteins to axons and dendrites. Although it is well known that the microtubule cytoskeleton has a central role in establishing neuronal polarity, how its specific organization is established and maintained is poorly understood. Using the in vivo model system <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we found that the highly conserved UNC-119 protein provides a link between the membrane-associated Ankyrin (UNC-44) and the microtubule-associated CRMP (UNC-33). Together they form a periodic membrane-associated complex that anchors axonal and dendritic microtubule bundles to the cortex. This anchoring is critical to maintain microtubule organization by opposing kinesin-1 powered microtubule sliding. Disturbing this molecular complex alters neuronal polarity and causes strong developmental defects of the nervous system leading to severely paralyzed animals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54863">STK25 suppresses Hippo signaling by regulating SAV1-STRIPAK antagonism</a></h4>

The MST-LATS kinase cascade is central to the Hippo pathway that controls tissue homeostasis, development, and organ size. The PP2A complex STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup> blocks MST1/2 activation. The GCKIII family kinases associate with STRIPAK, but the functions of these phosphatase-associated kinases remain elusive. We previously showed that the scaffolding protein SAV1 promotes Hippo signaling by counteracting STRIPAK (Bae et al. 2017). Here, we show that the GCKIII kinase STK25 promotes STRIPAK-mediated inhibition of MST2 in human cells. Depletion of STK25 enhances MST2 activation without affecting the integrity of STRIPAK<sup>SLMAP</sup>. STK25 directly phosphorylates SAV1 and diminishes the ability of SAV1 to inhibit STRIPAK. Thus, STK25 as the kinase component of STRIPAK can inhibit the function of the STRIPAK inhibitor SAV1. This mutual antagonism between STRIPAK and SAV1 controls the initiation of Hippo signaling.

The seminal description of the cellular restriction factor APOBEC3G and its antagonism by HIV-1 Vif has underpinned two decades of research on the host-virus interaction. We recently reported that HIV-1 Vif is also able to degrade the PPP2R5 family of regulatory subunits of key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E; Greenwood et al., 2016; Naamati et al., 2019). We now identify amino acid polymorphisms at positions 31 and 128 of HIV-1 Vif which selectively regulate the degradation of PPP2R5 family proteins. These residues covary across HIV-1 viruses <i>in vivo</i>, favouring depletion of PPP2R5A-E. Through analysis of point mutants and naturally occurring Vif variants, we further show that degradation of PPP2R5 family subunits is both necessary and sufficient for Vif-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Antagonism of PP2A by HIV-1 Vif is therefore independent of APOBEC3 family proteins, and regulates cell cycle progression in HIV-infected cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52653">Stretching the skin immediately enhances perceived stiffness and gradually enhances the predictive control of grip force</a></h4>

When manipulating objects, we use kinesthetic and tactile information to form an internal representation of their mechanical properties for cognitive perception and for preventing their slippage using predictive control of grip force. A major challenge in understanding the dissociable contributions of tactile and kinesthetic information to perception and action is the natural coupling between them. Unlike previous studies that addressed this question by focusing on impaired sensory processing in patients or via local anesthesia, we used a behavioral study with a programmable mechatronic device that stretches the skin of the fingertips to address this issue in the intact sensorimotor system. We found that artificial skin-stretch increases the predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of the load force. Moreover, the stretch causes an immediate illusion of touching a harder object that does not depend on the gradual development of the predictive modulation of grip force.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52322">The metalloproteinase Papp-aa controls epithelial cell quiescence-proliferation transition</a></h4>

Human patients carrying <i>PAPP</i><i>‐A2</i> inactivating mutations have low bone mineral density. The underlying mechanisms for this reduced calcification are poorly understood. Using a zebrafish model, we report that Papp-aa regulates bone calcification by promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting epithelial cell (ionocyte) quiescence-proliferation transition. Ionocytes, which are normally quiescent, re-enter the cell cycle under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress. Genetic deletion of Papp-aa, but not the closely related Papp-ab, abolished ionocyte proliferation and reduced calcified bone mass. Loss of Papp-aa expression or activity resulted in diminished IGF1 receptor-Akt-Tor signaling in ionocytes. Under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress, Papp-aa cleaved Igfbp5a. Under normal conditions, however, Papp-aa proteinase activity was suppressed and IGFs were sequestered  in the IGF/Igfbp complex. Pharmacological disruption of the IGF/Igfbp complex or adding free IGF1 activated IGF signaling and promoted ionocyte proliferation. These findings suggest that Papp-aa-mediated local Igfbp5a cleavage functions as a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-regulated molecular switch linking IGF signaling to bone calcification by stimulating epithelial cell quiescence-proliferation transition under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51773">Determinants of MDA impact and designing MDAs towards malaria elimination</a></h4>

Malaria remains at the forefront of scientific research and global political and funding agendas. Malaria models have consistently oversimplified how mass interventions are implemented. Here, we present an individual based, spatially explicit model of <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria transmission that includes all the programmatic implementation details of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. We uncover how the impact of MDA campaigns is determined by the interaction between implementation logistics, patterns of human mobility and how transmission risk is distributed over space. Our results indicate that malaria elimination is only realistically achievable in settings with very low prevalence and can be hindered by spatial heterogeneities in risk. In highly mobile populations, accelerating MDA implementation increases likelihood of elimination; if populations are more static, deploying less teams would be cost optimal. We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in low endemicity areas, specifically when paired with effective vector control.

A number of prenatal experiences are associated with adverse outcomes after birth, ranging from cardiovascular problems to psychiatric disease. Prenatal stress is associated with neurodevelopmental alterations that persist after birth and manifest at the behavioral level, for example, increased fearfulness, and at the physiological one, that is, brain structural and functional changes. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these lasting effects may help in preventing long-term negative outcomes of prenatal stress.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a largely heritable, multistage prenatal disorder that impacts a child’s ability to perceive and react to social information. Most ASD risk genes are expressed prenatally in many ASD-relevant brain regions and fall into two categories: broadly expressed regulatory genes that are expressed in the brain and other organs, and brain-specific genes. In trimesters one to three (Epoch-1), one set of broadly expressed (the majority) and brain-specific risk genes disrupts cell proliferation, neurogenesis, migration, and cell fate, while in trimester three and early postnatally (Epoch-2) another set (the majority being brain specific) disrupts neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and the ‘wiring’ of the cortex.

Crossmodal correspondences are the associations between apparently distinct stimuli in different sensory modalities . These associations, albeit surprising, are generally shared in most of the population. Olfaction is ingrained in the fabric of our daily life and constitutes an integral part of our perceptual reality, with olfaction being more commonly used in the entertainment and analytical domains, it is crucial to uncover the robust correspondences underlying common aromatic compounds. Towards this end, we investigated an aggregate of crossmodal correspondences between ten olfactory stimuli and other modalities ( angularity of shapes, smoothness of texture, pleasantness, pitch, colours, musical genres and emotional dimensions ) using a large sample of 68 observers. We uncover the correspondences between these modalities and extent of these associations with respect to the explicit knowledge of the respective aromatic compound. The results revealed the robustness of prior studies, as well as, contributions towards olfactory integration between an aggregate of other dimensions. The knowledge of an odour's identity coupled with the multisensory perception of the odours indicates that these associations, for the most part, are relatively robust and do not rely on explicit knowledge of the odour. Through principal component analysis of the perceptual ratings, new cross-model mediations have been uncovered between odours and their intercorrelated sensory dimensions. Our results demonstrate a collective of associations between olfaction and other dimensions, potential cross modal mediations via exploratory factor analysis and the robustness of these correspondence with respect to the explicit knowledge of an odour. We anticipate the findings reported in this paper could be used as a psychophysical framework aiding in a collective of applications ranging from olfaction enhanced multimedia to marketing.

There is ample evidence that the brain matches sensory information with internal templates, but the details of this mechanism remain unknown. Here we consider the processing of repeatedly presented ambiguous stimuli with high ambiguity (HA) and low ambiguity (LA) and analyze how the processing depends on the ambiguity of the previous stimulus. On the behavioral level, we report a faster response to the HA stimulus after HA stimuli and a faster response to the LA stimulus after LA stimuli. The EEG analysis reveals that when HA stimulus follows LA stimuli, the neuronal activity in the sensory areas attenuates at the early processing stage but enhances during the latter stages. It evidences the hierarchical processing organization where low levels process the stimulus details, and high levels represent its interpretation. It also confirms that on low levels, HA and LA stimuli processing is similar due to their similar morphology. Therefore, the brain uses the LA stimulus template on the low levels to reduce the demands when processing the HA stimulus details. When LA stimulus follows HA stimuli, the attenuated response in the sensory regions accompanies high response in the frontal cortex. Namely, we observe high theta power in the medial frontal cortex and high beta power in the right inferior frontal cortex. It shows activation of the top-down cognitive control functions detecting the mismatch between the LA stimulus and the HA stimulus template and transfer this template to the low processing levels.

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for associating initially neutral cues with appetitive and aversive stimuli and receives dense neuromodulatory acetylcholine (ACh) projections. We measured BLA ACh signaling and principal neuron activity in mice during cue-reward learning using a fluorescent ACh sensor and calcium indicators. We found that ACh levels and activity of nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) cholinergic terminals in the BLA (NBM-BLA) increased sharply in response to reward-related events and shifted as mice learned the tone-reward contingency. BLA principal neuron activity followed reward retrieval and moved to the reward-predictive tone after task acquisition. Optical stimulation of cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fibers during cue-reward learning led to more rapid learning of the cue-reward contingency. These results indicate that BLA ACh signaling carries important information about salient events in cue-reward learning and provides a framework for understanding how ACh signaling contributes to shaping BLA responses to emotional stimuli.

Adaptive agents must act in intrinsically uncertain environments with complex latent structure. Here, we elaborate a model of visual foraging - in a hierarchical context - wherein agents infer a higher-order visual pattern (a "scene") by sequentially sampling ambiguous cues. Inspired by previous models of scene construction - that cast perception and action as consequences of approximate Bayesian inference - we use active inference to simulate decisions of agents categorising a scene in a hierarchically-structured setting. Under active inference, agents develop probabilistic beliefs about their environment, while actively sampling it to maximise the evidence for their internal generative model. This approximate evidence maximisation (i.e. self-evidencing) comprises drives to both maximise rewards and resolve uncertainty about hidden states. This is realised via minimisation of a free energy functional of posterior beliefs about both the world as well as the actions used to sample or perturb it, corresponding to perception and action, respectively. We show that active inference, in the context of hierarchical scene construction, gives rise to many empirical evidence accumulation phenomena, such as noise-sensitive reaction times and epistemic saccades. We explain these behaviours in terms of the principled drives that constitute the expected free energy, the key quantity for evaluating policies under active inference. In addition, we report novel behaviours exhibited by these active inference agents that furnish new predictions for research on evidence accumulation and perceptual decision-making. We discuss the implications of this hierarchical active inference scheme for tasks that require planned sequences of information-gathering actions to infer compositional latent structure (such as visual scene construction and sentence comprehension). Finally, we propose experiments to contextualise active inference in relation to other formulations of evidence accumulation (e.g. drift-diffusion models) in tasks that require planning in uncertain environments with higher-order structure.

People tend to fall asleep when gently rocked or vibrated. Experimental studies have shown rocking promotes sleep in humans and mice. The prevailing "synchronization" model proposes synchronization of brain activity to mechanosensory stimuli mediates the phenomenon. The alternative "habituation" model proposes habituation, a form of non-associative learning, mediates sleep induction by monotonous stimulation. Here we show that gentle vibration promotes sleep in Drosophila in part through habituation. Vibration-induced sleep (VIS) leads to the accrual of homeostatic sleep credit, is associated with reduced arousability, and can be suppressed by heightened arousal. Sleep induction improves over successive blocks of vibration and exhibits stimulus specificity, supporting the habituation model. Multiple mechanosensory organs mediate VIS, and the magnitude of sleep gain depends on the vibration frequency and genetic background. Our findings suggest habituation is a major contributor to VIS, but synchronization of brain activity may play a role under certain stimulus conditions.

Experience induces complex, neuron-specific changes in population activity within sensory cortex circuits. However, the mechanisms that enable neuron-specific changes within cortical populations remain unclear. To explore the idea that synapse strengthening is involved, we studied fine-scale cortical plasticity in Syngap1 mice, a neurodevelopmental disorder model useful for linking synapse biology to circuit functions. Repeated functional imaging of the same L2/3 somatosensory cortex neurons during single whisker experience revealed that Syngap1 selectively regulated the plasticity of a low-active, or silent, neuronal subpopulation. Syngap1 also regulated spike-timing-dependent synaptic potentiation and experience-mediated in vivo synapse bouton formation, but not synaptic depression or bouton elimination in L2/3. Adult re-expression of Syngap1 restored plasticity of silent neurons, demonstrating that this gene controls dynamic cellular processes required for population-specific changes to cortical circuits during experience. These findings suggest that abnormal experience-dependent redistribution of cortical population activity may contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Our understanding of the changes in functional brain organization in autism is hampered by the extensive heterogeneity that characterizes this neurodevelopmental disorder. Data driven clustering offers a straightforward way to decompose this heterogeneity into subtypes of distinguishable connectivity types and promises an unbiased framework to investigate behavioural symptoms and causative genetic factors. Yet the robustness and generalizability of these imaging subtypes is unknown. Here, we show that unsupervised functional connectivity subtypes are moderately associated with the clinical diagnosis of autism, and that these associations generalize to independent replication data. We found that subtypes identified robust patterns of functional connectivity, but that a discrete assignment of individuals to these subtypes was not supported by the data. Our results support the use of data driven subtyping as a data dimensionality reduction technique, rather than to establish clinical categories.

The pathophysiology of the majority of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and mood disorders, involves synaptic dysfunction and/or loss, manifesting as lower levels of several presynaptic and postsynaptic marker proteins. Whether chronic exposure to antipsychotic drugs may contribute to this pattern of synaptic loss remains controversial. In contrast, the mood stabiliser lithium has shown to exhibit neurotrophic actions and is thought to enhance synapse formation. Whilst these data are not unequivocal, they suggest that antipsychotic drugs and lithium have contrasting effects on synapse density. We therefore investigated the effect of chronic exposure to lithium and to two different antipsychotics, haloperidol and olanzapine, on presynaptic Synaptic Vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) and postsynaptic Neuroligin (NLGN) clusters in the rat frontal cortex. Chronic exposure (28 days) to haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg/d) or olanzapine (7.5 mg/kg/d) had no effect on either SV2A or NLGN clusters and no overall effect on synaptic clusters. In contrast, chronic lithium exposure (2 mmol/L eq./d) significantly increased NLGN cluster density as compared to vehicle, but did not affect either SV2A or total synaptic clusters. These data are consistent with and extend our prior work, confirming no effect of either antipsychotics or lithium on SV2A clustering, but suggest contrasting effects of these drugs on the post-synapse. Although caution needs to be exerted when extrapolating results from animals to patients, these data provide clarity with regard to the effect of antipsychotics and lithium on synaptic markers, thus facilitating discrimination of drug from illness effects in human studies of synaptic pathology in psychiatric disorders.

Remembering the temporal order of a sequence of events is a task easily performed by humans in everyday life, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unclear. This problem is particularly intriguing as human behavior often proceeds on a time scale of seconds, which is in stark contrast to the much faster millisecond time-scale of neuronal processing in our brains. One long-held hypothesis in sequence learning suggests that a particular temporal ne-structure of neuronal activity - termed "phase precession" - enables the compression of slow behavioral sequences down to the fast time scale of the induction of synaptic plasticity. Using mathematical analysis and computer simulations, we nd that phase precession can improve sequence learning tremendously and that the asymmetric part of the synaptic learning window is essential for temporal-order learning. To test these predictions, we suggest experiments that selectively alter phase precession or the learning window and evaluate memory of temporal order.

With increased life expectancy, age-associated cognitive decline becomes a growing concern. The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated during aging and contributes to age-related brain phenotypes. We demonstrate that treatment with the drug-like small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB reverses ISR activation in the brain, as indicated by decreased activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein levels. Furthermore, ISRIB treatment reverses spatial memory deficits and ameliorates working memory in old mice. At the cellular level in the hippocampus, ISR inhibition i) rescues intrinsic neuronal electrophysiological properties, ii) restores spine density and iii) reduces immune profiles, specifically interferon and T cell-mediated responses. Thus, pharmacological interference with the ISR emerges as a promising intervention strategy for combating age-related cognitive decline.

<p>by Olga A. Vsevolozhskaya, Min Shi, Fengjiao Hu, Dmitri V. Zaykin</p>

Historically, the majority of statistical association methods have been designed assuming availability of SNP-level information. However, modern genetic and sequencing data present new challenges to access and sharing of genotype-phenotype datasets, including cost of management, difficulties in consolidation of records across research groups, etc. These issues make methods based on SNP-level summary statistics particularly appealing. The most common form of combining statistics is a sum of SNP-level squared scores, possibly weighted, as in burden tests for rare variants. The overall significance of the resulting statistic is evaluated using its distribution under the null hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that this basic approach can be substantially improved by decorrelating scores prior to their addition, resulting in remarkable power gains in situations that are most commonly encountered in practice; namely, under heterogeneity of effect sizes and diversity between pairwise LD. In these situations, the power of the traditional test, based on the added squared scores, quickly reaches a ceiling, as the number of variants increases. Thus, the traditional approach does not benefit from information potentially contained in any additional SNPs, while our decorrelation by orthogonal transformation (DOT) method yields steady gain in power. We present theoretical and computational analyses of both approaches, and reveal causes behind sometimes dramatic difference in their respective powers. We showcase DOT by analyzing breast cancer and cleft lip data, in which our method strengthened levels of previously reported associations and implied the possibility of multiple new alleles that jointly confer disease risk.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWoupzt8V7I" width="1" />

<sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis (<sup>13</sup>C-MFA) allows metabolic fluxes to be quantified in living organisms and is a major tool in biotechnology and systems biology. Current <sup>13</sup>C-MFA approaches model label propagation starting from the extracellular <sup>13</sup>C-labeled nutrient(s), which limits their applicability to the analysis of pathways close to this metabolic entry point. Here, we propose a new approach to quantify fluxes through any metabolic subnetwork of interest by modeling label propagation directly from the metabolic precursor(s) of this subnetwork. The flux calculations are thus purely based on information from within the subnetwork of interest, and no additional knowledge about the surrounding network (such as atom transitions in upstream reactions or the labeling of the extracellular nutrient) is required. This approach, termed ScalaFlux for SCALAble metabolic FLUX analysis, can be scaled up from individual reactions to pathways to sets of pathways. ScalaFlux has several benefits compared with current <sup>13</sup>C-MFA approaches: greater network coverage, lower data requirements, independence from cell physiology, robustness to gaps in data and network information, better computational efficiency, applicability to rich media, and enhanced flux identifiability. We validated ScalaFlux using a theoretical network and simulated data. We also used the approach to quantify fluxes through the prenyl pyrophosphate pathway of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutants engineered to produce phytoene, using a dataset for which fluxes could not be calculated using existing approaches. A broad range of metabolic systems can be targeted with minimal cost and effort, making ScalaFlux a valuable tool for the analysis of metabolic fluxes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i5lyyQXk8Fc" width="1" />

<p>by Aurel A. Lazar, Chung-Heng Yeh</p>

Over the past two decades, substantial amount of work has been conducted to characterize different odorant receptors, neuroanatomy and odorant response properties of the early olfactory system of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Yet many odorant receptors remain only partially characterized, and the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have yet to be fully determined. Identity and concentration, two key characteristics of the space of odorants, are encoded by the odorant transduction process. Detailed molecular models of the odorant transduction process are, however, scarce for fruit flies. To address these challenges we advance a comprehensive model of fruit fly OSNs as a cascade consisting of an odorant transduction process (OTP) and a biophysical spike generator (BSG). We model odorant identity and concentration using an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor, modulated by the odorant concentration profile, and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the mechanics of the molecular ligand binding/dissociation of the OTP. We model the BSG as a Connor-Stevens point neuron. The resulting spatio-temporal encoding model of the <i>Drosophila</i> antenna provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the neural code of both odorant identity and odorant concentration and advances the state-of-the-art in a number of ways. First, it quantifies on the molecular level the spatio-temporal level of complexity of the transformation taking place in the antennae. The concentration-dependent spatio-temporal code at the output of the antenna circuits determines the level of complexity of olfactory processing in the downstream neuropils, such as odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning. Second, the model is biologically validated using multiple electrophysiological recordings. Third, the model demonstrates that the currently available data for odorant-receptor responses only enable the estimation of the affinity of the odorant-receptor pairs. The odorant-dissociation rate is only available for a few odorant-receptor pairs. Finally, our model calls for new experiments for massively identifying the odorant-receptor dissociation rates of relevance to flies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FlzLSYrp04s" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning is well established, but the precise relative contributions by the dorsal (septal) and ventral (temporal) subregions remain unresolved. One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R">Longitudinal assessment of multiple sclerosis with the brain‐age paradigm</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>During the natural course of MS, the brain is exposed to ageing as well as disease effects. Brain ageing can be modelled statistically; the so‐called ‘brain‐age’ paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression and future outcomes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a longitudinal, multi‐centre sample of 3,565 MRI scans, in 1,204 MS and clinically‐isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured ‘brain‐predicted age’ using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD between MS and CIS patients and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MS patients had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years [95% CI 8.5, 12.1] versus 4.3 years [−2.1, 6.4], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+19.4 years [17.1, 21.9]). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); though normalised brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualised brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualised EDSS score (r = 0.26, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, ‘brain‐age’ could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrolment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rodent and human studies examining the relationship between aerobic exercise, brain structure, and brain function indicate that the hippocampus (HC), a brain region critical for episodic memory, demonstrates striking plasticity in response to exercise. Beyond the hippocampal memory system, human studies also indicate that aerobic exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with individual differences in large‐scale brain networks responsible for broad cognitive domains. Examining network activity in large‐scale resting‐state brain networks may provide a link connecting the observed relationships between aerobic exercise, hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive enhancement within broad cognitive domains. Previously, CRF has been associated with increased functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), specifically in older adults. However, how CRF relates to the magnitude and directionality of connectivity, or effective connectivity, between the HC and other DMN nodes remains unknown. We used resting‐state fMRI and conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to test the hypothesis that CRF positively predicts effective connectivity between the HC and other DMN nodes in healthy young adults. Twenty‐six participants (ages 18–35 years) underwent a treadmill test to determine CRF by estimating its primary determinant, maximal oxygen uptake (V<sup>.</sup>O<sub>2max</sub>), and a 10‐min resting‐state fMRI scan to examine DMN effective connectivity. We identified the DMN using group independent component analysis and examined effective connectivity between nodes using CGCA. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that CRF significantly predicts causal influence from the HC to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex and to the HC from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The observed relationship between CRF and hippocampal effective connectivity provides a link between the rodent literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal plasticity, and the human literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and CRF and the enhancement of broad cognitive domains including, but not limited to, memory.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurobiology of postnatal hippocampal development in rodents is receiving increased attention as a means to address neurodevelopmental questions and to better understand the neural code(s) for spatial navigation in adulthood. We previously showed that spontaneous alternation (SA) in a Y‐maze, which emerges at the end of the third postnatal week, was related to changes in fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In adults, oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) (i.e., theta, 4–12 Hz; slow gamma, 25–55 Hz; and fast gamma, 65–100 Hz) have been shown to coordinate the activity of spatially tuned cell types in the hippocampus during route planning and execution. Other investigators have shown that theta activity matures during the first month of life. However, relationships between developmental alterations in gamma oscillations and cognitive function have not been investigated in juveniles, and the impact of developmental changes in excitatory synaptic transmission on network activity remains unclear. We implanted rats at postnatal day 14 to record LFPs from the synaptic layer of area CA1 during Y‐maze exploration at postnatal Days 18, 19, 23, and 24. The positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, CX614, or vehicle was administered prior to each test. We found that slow gamma peak frequency, but not peak power, remained constant across this age range. Fast gamma event rate increased with increasing age, while peak frequency decreased. AMPA receptor modulation impacted slow and fast gamma differently at different ages. Furthermore, gamma events showed relationships with novelty and movement speed that differed based on gamma sub‐band (slow vs. fast). These results support the presence of environmentally‐driven gamma oscillations in hippocampal network activity prior to the end of the third postnatal week of development. Differential refinement of slow and fast gamma occurring across the subsequent week supports involvement in the emergence of spatial navigation ability.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Converging evidence suggests a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal neuroplasticity that interactively impacts hippocampally dependent memory. The majority of human studies have focused on the potential for exercise to reduce brain atrophy and attenuate cognitive decline in older adults, whereas animal studies often center on exercise‐induced neurogenesis and hippocampal plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of young adult animals. In the present study, initially sedentary young adults (18–35 years) participated in a moderate‐intensity randomized controlled exercise intervention trial (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>; NCT02057354) for a duration of 12 weeks. The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between change in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as determined by estimated 
<sub>MAX</sub>, hippocampally dependent mnemonic discrimination, and change in hippocampal subfield volume. Results show that improving CRF after exercise training is associated with an increased volume in the left DG/CA3 subregion in young adults. Consistent with previous studies that found exercise‐induced increases in anterior hippocampus in older adults, this result was specific to the hippocampal head, or most anterior portion, of the subregion. Our results also demonstrate a positive relationship between change in CRF and change in corrected accuracy for trials requiring the highest level of discrimination on a putative behavioral pattern separation task. This relationship was observed in individuals who were initially lower‐fit, suggesting that individuals who show greater improvement in their CRF may receive greater cognitive benefit. This work extends animal models by providing evidence for exercise‐induced neuroplasticity specific to the neurogenic zone of the human hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gene and protein expressions are key determinants of cellular function. Neurons are the building blocks of brain circuits, yet the relationship between their molecular identity and the spatial distribution of their dendritic inputs and axonal outputs remains incompletely understood. The open‐source knowledge base <a href="http://hippocampome.org" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">Hippocampome.org</a> amasses such transcriptomic data from the scientific literature for morphologically defined neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation: dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Positive, negative, or mixed expression reports were initially obtained from published articles directly connecting molecular evidence to neurons with known axonal and dendritic patterns across hippocampal layers. Here, we supplement this information by collating, formalizing, and leveraging relational expression inferences that link a gene or protein expression or lack thereof to that of another molecule or to an anatomical location. With these additional interpretations, we freely release online a comprehensive human‐ and machine‐readable molecular profile for more than 100 neuron types in <a href="http://hippocampome.org" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">Hippocampome.org</a>. Analysis of these data ascertains the ability to distinguish unequivocally most neuron types in each of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus based on currently known biochemical markers. Moreover, grouping neuron types by expression similarity reveals eight superfamilies characterized by a few defining molecules.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is considerable evidence from non‐human animal studies that the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus have different anatomical connections and support different behavioural functions. Although there are some recent human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that have addressed this idea directly in the memory and spatial processing domains and provided support for it, there has been no broader meta‐analysis of the fMRI literature to determine if there is consistent evidence for functional dissociations in anterior and posterior hippocampus across all of the different cognitive domains in which the hippocampus participates. The purpose of this review is to address this gap in our knowledge using three approaches. One approach involved PubMed searches to identify relevant fMRI papers reporting hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, working memory, spatial navigation, simulation/scene construction, transitive inference, and social cognition tasks. The second was to use a large meta‐analytic database (neurosynth) to find text terms and coactivation maps associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions identified in the literature search. The third approach was to contrast the resting‐state functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions using a publicly available database that includes a large sample of adults. These three approaches provided converging evidence that not only are cognitive processes differently distributed along the hippocampal axis, but there also are distinct areas coactivated and functionally connected with the anterior and posterior segments. This anterior/posterior distinction involving multiple cognitive domains is consistent with the animal literature and provides strong support from fMRI for the idea of functional dissociations across the long axis of the hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>M‐type (KCNQ2/3) K<sup>+</sup> channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike‐frequency adaptation, and hyper‐excitatory states. However, plasticity of M‐channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability‐induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48 hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant‐induced hyperexcitability at 48 hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper‐excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2‐mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7 days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain‐slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M‐current amplitudes 48 hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M‐current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic–clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M‐channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell‐type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.</p>

Abstract
<p>A key goal in hippocampal research is to understand how neuronal activity is generated and organized across hippocampal subregions to enable memory formation and retrieval. Neuronal activity in CA2 is regulated by spatial and social investigation as well as by novelty (Mankin et al., 2015; Alexander et al., 2016), and CA2 activity controls population oscillatory activity in the slow  and ripple ranges within hippocampus (Kay et al., 2016; Oliva et al., 2016; Boehringer et al., 2017; Alexander et al., 2018). CA2 neurons are also required for social recognition memory (Stevenson and Caldwell, 2012; Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Smith et al., 2016). Because CA1 exhibits layer-specific organization (Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012; Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014, 2016) reflective of its inputs (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2014), and because CA2 activity controls CA1 slow  (Alexander et al., 2018), we hypothesized that silencing CA2 would affect CA1 slow  in a layer-specific manner during investigation of a novel social stimulus. While recording from CA1, we leveraged molecular tools to selectively target and inhibit CA2 pyramidal cells using inhibitory DREADDs while subject mice investigated novel animals or objects. We found that CA2 inhibition reduced slow  power during investigation of a novel animal and fast  power during both novel object and animal investigation in a manner reflective of the CA2 axonal projection zones within CA1. Our results suggest that CA2 contributes to CA1 slow and fast  oscillations in a stimulus-specific manner.</p>

<p>Potential molecular mechanism by which pfn1 regulates microglia polarization and hypoxia/ischemia injuries.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglial polarization to the anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype is essential in resolving neuroinflammation, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke intervention. The actin cytoskeleton is known to be important for the physiological functions of microglia, including migration and phagocytosis. Profilin 1 (PFN1), an actin‐binding protein, is involved in the dynamic transformation and reorganization of actin. However, the role of PFN1 in microglial polarization and ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. The role of PFN1 on microglial polarization was examined <i>in vitro</i> in BV2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) and <i>in vivo</i> in male mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of PFN1 inhibited M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglia polarization 48 hr after OGDR stimulation in BV2 cells and 7 days after MCAO‐induced injury in male mice. RhoA/ROCK pathway was involved in the regulation of PFN1 during microglial polarization. Knockdown of PFN1 also significantly attenuated brain infarcts and edema, improved cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits in MCAO‐injured mice. Inhibition of PFN1 effectively protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injuries by promoting M2 microglial polarization <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

<p>The teleost fish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave <i>Astyanax</i> brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.


</p>
<br />
<p><i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral <i>Astyanax</i> are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave <i>Astyanax</i> using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with non‐visual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave <i>Astyanax</i> in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 8‐ to 12‐year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T1‐weighted volumetric (n = 1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n = 1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n = 41,505) and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA), and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS PRS and global FA (β = 0.098, standard error [SE] = 0.030, <i>p</i> = 1.08 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n = 186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (global FA; β = 0.189, SE = 0.072, <i>p</i> = 9.40 × 10<sup>−3</sup>).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a preadolescent time window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:774–787</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X‐linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the <i>MECP2</i> gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS‐theta burst stimulation was used to probe long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (<i>p</i> = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short‐interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long‐interval intracortical inhibition (<i>p</i> = 0.002). LTP‐like plasticity in M1 was abolished (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all <i>p</i> = 0.003).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763–773</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD, and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (&gt;0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of &gt;80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:751–762</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using <i>N</i>‐(3‐[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoropropyl)‐2β‐carbon ethoxy‐3β‐(4‐iodophenyl) nortropane (FP‐CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:739–750</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:725–738</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is conventionally not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex postprocessing, or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness, and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub> relaxometry and proton density mapping in multiple sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3T MRI ex vivo in 3 multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan–rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Because the technique is fast, with automatic postprocessing and US Food and Drug Administration/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:710–724</b></p>

<p>Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:700–709</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national health care and census registers. We included 4,187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1,620 of fingolimod, and 1,670 of natalizumab in 6,136 MS patients matched for age, sex, and location to 37,801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate [IR] per 10,000 person‐years = 34.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.7–48.3), fingolimod 28 (IR = 44.0, 95% CI = 29.2–63.5), and natalizumab 17 (IR = 26.0, 95% CI = 15.1–41.6). The general population IR was 31.0 (95% CI = 27.8–34.4). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.98–2.38) and rituximab (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00–2.84).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this first large comparative study of 3 highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer, and further studies are warranted to validate these findings. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:688–699</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:670–676</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with MS and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. We investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter lesions to thalamic volume.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used postmortem <i>in situ</i> MRI's of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/FLAIR hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (p = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex and T2 lesion volume, neither total (p = 0.20), ovoid (p = 0.31), or subependymal (p = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman's rho = −0.65, p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted MRI scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and CSA. Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and non‐carriers by testing the ‘age by genetic status’ interaction. False‐discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers and 249 controls (age range 18–86). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporo‐parietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial fronto‐parietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral fronto‐parieto‐temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventro‐frontal regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within
Wuhan, China. As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all
parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS)
becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model
is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days
based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model,
named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based
on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural
network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the
performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this
methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its
parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding
forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data
of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the
confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed
forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices
including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization
algorithms are presented. The proposed model is investigated in the most
affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain). The experimental simulations
illustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance rather
than the other algorithms while forecasting task for the candidate countries.

<p>This technical report aims at defining a formal framework for Deep Neural
Network (DNN) layer-wise quantization, focusing in particular on the problems
related to the final deployment. It also acts as a documentation for the NEMO
(NEural Minimization for pytOrch) framework. It describes the four DNN
representations used in NEMO (FullPrecision, FakeQuantized, QuantizedDeployable
and IntegerDeployable), focusing in particular on a formal definition of the
latter two. An important feature of this model, and in particular the
IntegerDeployable representation, is that it enables DNN inference using purely
integers - without resorting to real-valued numbers in any part of the
computation and without relying on an explicit fixed-point numerical
representation.

<p>When participants in an experiment have to name pictures while ignoring
distractor words superimposed on the picture or presented auditorily (i.e.,
picture-word interference paradigm), they take more time when the word to be
named (or target) and distractor words are from the same semantic category
(e.g., cat-dog). This experimental effect is known as the semantic interference
effect, and is probably one of the most studied in the language production
literature. The functional origin of the effect and the exact conditions in
which it occurs are however still debated. Since Lupker reported the effect in
the first response time experiment about 40 years ago, more than 300 similar
experiments have been conducted. The semantic interference effect was
replicated in many experiments, but several studies also reported the absence
of an effect in a subset of experimental conditions. The aim of the present
study is to provide a comprehensive theoretical review of the existing evidence
to date and several Bayesian meta-analyses and meta-regressions to determine
the size of the effect and explore the experimental conditions in which the
effect surfaces. The results are discussed in the light of current debates
about the functional origin of the semantic interference effect and its
implications for our understanding of the language production system.

<p>Low-precision networks, with weights and activations quantized to low
bit-width, are widely used to accelerate inference on edge devices. However,
current solutions are uniform, using identical bit-width for all filters. This
fails to account for the different sensitivities of different filters and is
suboptimal. Mixed-precision networks address this problem, by tuning the
bit-width to individual filter requirements. In this work, the problem of
optimal mixed-precision network search (MPS) is considered. To circumvent its
difficulties of discrete search space and combinatorial optimization, a new
differentiable search architecture is proposed, with several novel
contributions to advance the efficiency by leveraging the unique properties of
the MPS problem. The resulting Efficient differentiable MIxed-Precision network
Search (EdMIPS) method is effective at finding the optimal bit allocation for
multiple popular networks, and can search a large model, e.g. Inception-V3,
directly on ImageNet without proxy task in a reasonable amount of time. The
learned mixed-precision networks significantly outperform their uniform
counterparts.

<p>We argue that proven exponential upper bounds on runtimes, an established
area in classic algorithms, are interesting also in evolutionary computation
and we prove several such results. We show that any of the algorithms
randomized local search, Metropolis algorithm, simulated annealing, and (1+1)
evolutionary algorithm can optimize any pseudo-Boolean weakly monotonic
function under a large set of noise assumptions in a runtime that is at most
exponential in the problem dimension~$n$. This drastically extends a previous
such result, limited to the (1+1) EA, the LeadingOnes function, and one-bit or
bit-wise prior noise with noise probability at most $1/2$, and at the same time
simplifies its proof. With the same general argument, among others, we also
derive a sub-exponential upper bound for the runtime of the $(1,\lambda)$
evolutionary algorithm on the OneMax problem when the offspring population size
$\lambda$ is logarithmic, but below the efficiency threshold.

<p>Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) has demonstrated great
success in designing state-of-the-art, efficient neural networks. However,
DARTS-based DNAS's search space is small when compared to other search
methods', since all candidate network layers must be explicitly instantiated in
memory. To address this bottleneck, we propose a memory and computationally
efficient DNAS variant: DMaskingNAS. This algorithm expands the search space by
up to $10^{14}\times$ over conventional DNAS, supporting searches over spatial
and channel dimensions that are otherwise prohibitively expensive: input
resolution and number of filters. We propose a masking mechanism for feature
map reuse, so that memory and computational costs stay nearly constant as the
search space expands. Furthermore, we employ effective shape propagation to
maximize per-FLOP or per-parameter accuracy. The searched FBNetV2s yield
state-of-the-art performance when compared with all previous architectures.
With up to 421$\times$ less search cost, DMaskingNAS finds models with 0.9%
higher accuracy, 15% fewer FLOPs than MobileNetV3-Small; and with similar
accuracy but 20% fewer FLOPs than Efficient-B0. Furthermore, our FBNetV2

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05531">A Unified DNN Weight Compression Framework Using Reweighted Optimization Methods. (arXiv:2004.05531v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>To address the large model size and intensive computation requirement of deep
neural networks (DNNs), weight pruning techniques have been proposed and
generally fall into two categories, i.e., static regularization-based pruning
and dynamic regularization-based pruning. However, the former method currently
suffers either complex workloads or accuracy degradation, while the latter one
takes a long time to tune the parameters to achieve the desired pruning rate
without accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a unified DNN weight pruning
framework with dynamically updated regularization terms bounded by the
designated constraint, which can generate both non-structured sparsity and
different kinds of structured sparsity. We also extend our method to an
integrated framework for the combination of different DNN compression tasks.

<p>Pericytes are unique, multi-functional mural cells localized at the abluminal side of the perivascular space in microvessels. Originally discovered in 19th century, pericytes had drawn less attention until decades ago mainly due to lack of specific markers. Recently, however, a growing body of evidence has revealed that pericytes play various important roles: development and maintenance of blood–brain barrier (BBB), regulation of the neurovascular system (e.g., vascular stability, vessel formation, cerebral blood flow, etc.), trafficking of inflammatory cells, clearance of toxic waste products from the brain, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform these functions through coordinated crosstalk with neighboring cells including endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes contribute to a wide variety of diseases that lead to cognitive impairments such as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), acute stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. For instance, in SVDs, pericyte degeneration leads to microvessel instability and demyelination while in stroke, pericyte constriction after ischemia causes a no-reflow phenomenon in brain capillaries. In AD, which shares some common risk factors with vascular dementia, reduction in pericyte coverage and subsequent microvascular impairments are observed in association with white matter attenuation and contribute to impaired cognition. Pericyte loss causes BBB-breakdown, which stagnates amyloid β clearance and the leakage of neurotoxic molecules into the brain parenchyma. In this review, we first summarize the characteristics of brain microvessel pericytes, and their roles in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on how dysfunctional pericytes contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment including cerebral ‘small vessel’ and ‘large vessel’ diseases, as well as AD. Finally, we discuss therapeutic implications for these disorders by targeting pericytes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55587">Kin discrimination in social yeast is mediated by cell surface receptors of the Flo11 adhesin family</a></h4>

Microorganisms have evolved specific cell surface molecules that enable discrimination between cells from the same and from a different kind. Here, we investigate the role of Flo11-type cell surface adhesins from social yeasts in kin discrimination. We measure the adhesion forces mediated by Flo11A-type domains using single-cell force spectroscopy, quantify Flo11A-based cell aggregation in populations and determine the Flo11A-dependent segregation of competing yeast strains in biofilms. We find that Flo11A domains from diverse yeast species confer remarkably strong adhesion forces by establishing homotypic interactions between single cells, leading to efficient cell aggregation and biofilm formation in homogenous populations. Heterotypic interactions between Flo11A domains from different yeast species or <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strains confer weak adhesive forces and lead to efficient strain segregation in heterogenous populations, indicating that in social yeasts Flo11A-mediated cell adhesion is a major mechanism for kin discrimination at species and sub-species levels. These findings, together with our structure and mutation analysis of selected Flo11A domains, provide a rationale of how cell surface receptors have evolved in microorganisms to mediate kin discrimination.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55517">Cryo-EM structure <i>in situ </i>reveals a molecular switch that safeguards virus against genome loss</a></h4>

The portal protein is a key component of many double-stranded DNA viruses, governing capsid assembly and genome packaging. Twelve subunits of the portal protein define a tunnel, through which DNA is translocated into the capsid. It is unknown how the portal protein functions as a gatekeeper, preventing DNA slippage, whilst allowing its passage into the capsid, and how these processes are controlled. A cryo-EM structure of the portal protein of thermostable virus P23-45, determined <i>in situ </i>in its procapsid-bound state, indicates a mechanism that naturally safeguards the virus against genome loss. This occurs via an inversion of the conformation of the loops that define the constriction in the central tunnel, accompanied by a hydrophilic–hydrophobic switch. The structure also shows how translocation of DNA into the capsid could be modulated by a changing mode of protein–protein interactions between portal and capsid, across a symmetry-mismatched interface.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54695">Single cell transcriptomics identifies a unique adipose lineage cell population that regulates bone marrow environment</a></h4>

Bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells are a heterogeneous cell population involved in bone homeostasis and diseases such as osteoporosis. While it is long postulated that they originate from mesenchymal stem cells, the true identity of progenitors and their in vivo bifurcated differentiation routes into osteoblasts and adipocytes remain poorly understood. Here, by employing large scale single cell transcriptome analysis, we computationally defined mesenchymal progenitors at different stages and delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths in young, adult and aging mice. One identified subpopulation is a unique cell type that expresses adipocyte markers but contains no lipid droplets. As non-proliferative precursors for adipocytes, they exist abundantly as pericytes and stromal cells that form a ubiquitous 3D network inside the marrow cavity. Functionally they play critical roles in maintaining marrow vasculature and suppressing bone formation. Therefore, we name them marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs) and conclude that they are a new component of marrow adipose tissue.

Taking control of the cellular apparatus for protein production is a requirement for virus progression. To ensure this control, diverse strategies of cellular mimicry and/or ribosome hijacking evolved. The initiation stage of translation is specially targeted as it involves multiple steps and the engagement of numerous initiation factors. The use of structured RNA sequences, called <span class="underline">I</span>nternal <span class="underline">R</span>ibosomal <span class="underline">E</span>ntry <span class="underline">S</span>ites (IRES) in viral RNAs is a widespread strategy for the exploitation of eukaryotic initiation. Using a combination of electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and reconstituted translation initiation assays with native components, we characterized how a novel IRES at the 5'-UTR of a viral RNA assembles a functional initiation complex via an uAUG intermediate. The IRES features a novel extended, multi-domain architecture, circling the 40S head. The structures and accompanying functional data, illustrate the importance of 5'-UTR regions in translation regulation and underline the relevance of the untapped diversity of viral IRESs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53886">Systematic detection of horizontal gene transfer across genera among multidrug-resistant bacteria in a single hospital</a></h4>

Multidrug-resistant bacteria pose a serious health threat, especially in hospitals. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) facilitates the spread of antibiotic resistance, virulence, and environmental persistence genes between nosocomial pathogens. We screened the genomes of 2173 bacterial isolates from healthcare-associated infections from a single hospital over 18 months, and identified identical nucleotide regions in bacteria belonging to distinct genera. To further resolve these shared sequences, we performed long-read sequencing on a subset of isolates and generated highly contiguous genomes. We then tracked the appearance of ten different plasmids in all 2173 genomes, and found evidence of plasmid transfer independent from bacterial transmission. Finally, we identified two instances of likely plasmid transfer within individual patients, including one plasmid that likely transferred to a second patient. This work expands our understanding of HGT in healthcare settings, and can inform efforts to limit the spread of drug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53350">The natverse, a versatile toolbox for combining and analysing neuroanatomical data</a></h4>

To analyse neuron data at scale, neuroscientists expend substantial effort reading documentation, installing dependencies and moving between analysis and visualisation environments. To facilitate this, we have developed a suite of interoperable open-source R packages called the natverse. The natverse allows users to read local and remote data, perform popular analyses including visualisation and clustering and graph-theoretic analysis of neuronal branching. Unlike most tools, the natverse enables comparison across many neurons of morphology and connectivity after imaging or co-registration within a common template space. The natverse also enables transformations between different template spaces and imaging modalities. We demonstrate tools that integrate the vast majority of <i>Drosophila</i> neuroanatomical light microscopy and electron microscopy connectomic datasets. The <i>natverse</i> is an easy-to-use environment for neuroscientists to solve complex, large-scale analysis challenges as well as an open platform to create new code and packages to share with the community.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53085">Chloride channels regulate differentiation and barrier functions of the mammalian airway</a></h4>

The conducting airway forms a protective mucosal barrier and is the primary target of airway disorders. The molecular events required for the formation and function of the airway mucosal barrier, as well as the mechanisms by which barrier dysfunction leads to early onset airway diseases, remain unclear. In this study, we systematically characterized the developmental landscape of the mouse airway using single-cell RNA sequencing and identified remarkably conserved cellular programs operating during human fetal development. We demonstrated that in mouse, genetic inactivation of chloride channel <i>Ano1/Tmem16a </i>compromises airway barrier function, results in early signs of inflammation, and alters the airway cellular landscape by depleting epithelial progenitors. Mouse <i>Ano1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants exhibited mucus obstruction and abnormal mucociliary clearance that resemble the airway defects associated with cystic fibrosis. The data reveal critical and non-redundant roles for <i>Ano1</i> in organogenesis, and show that chloride channels are essential for mammalian airway formation and function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53041">Cre-assisted fine-mapping of neural circuits using orthogonal split inteins</a></h4>

Existing genetic methods of neuronal targeting do not routinely achieve the resolution required for mapping brain circuits. New approaches are thus necessary. Here, we introduce a method for refined neuronal targeting that can be applied iteratively. Restriction achieved at the first step can be further refined in a second step, if necessary. The method relies on first isolating neurons within a targeted group (i.e. Gal4 pattern) according to their developmental lineages, and then intersectionally limiting the number of lineages by selecting only those in which two distinct neuroblast enhancers are active. The neuroblast enhancers drive expression of split Cre recombinase fragments. These are fused to non-interacting pairs of split inteins, which ensure reconstitution of active Cre when all fragments are expressed in the same neuroblast. Active Cre renders all neuroblast-derived cells in a lineage permissive for Gal4 activity. We demonstrate how this system can facilitate neural circuit-mapping in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52505">Cryo-EM structure of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC4 in lipid nanodiscs</a></h4>

Cation-chloride-cotransporters (CCCs) catalyze transport of Cl<sup>-</sup> with K<sup>+</sup> and/or Na<sup>+</sup> across cellular membranes. CCCs play roles in cellular volume regulation, neural development and function, audition, regulation of blood pressure, and renal function. CCCs are targets of clinically important drugs including loop diuretics and their disruption has been implicated in pathophysiology including epilepsy, hearing loss, and the genetic disorders Andermann, Gitelman, and Bartter syndromes. Here we present the structure of a CCC, the <i>Mus musculus</i> K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter (KCC) KCC4, in lipid nanodiscs determined by cryo-EM. The structure, captured in an inside-open conformation, reveals the architecture of KCCs including an extracellular domain poised to regulate transport activity through an outer gate. We identify binding sites for substrate K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, demonstrate the importance of key coordinating residues for transporter activity, and provide a structural explanation for varied substrate specificity and ion transport ratio among CCCs. These results provide mechanistic insight into the function and regulation of a physiologically important transporter family.

Retromer, including Vps35, Vps26, and Vps29, is a protein complex responsible for recycling proteins within the endolysosomal pathway. Although implicated in both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, our understanding of retromer function in the adult brain remains limited, in part because <i>Vps35 </i>and <i>Vps26 </i>are essential for development. In <i>Drosophila</i>, we find that <i>Vps29</i> is dispensable for embryogenesis but required for retromer function in aging adults, including for synaptic transmission, survival, and locomotion. Unexpectedly, in <i>Vps29 </i>mutants, Vps35 and Vps26 proteins are normally expressed and associated, but retromer is mislocalized from neuropil to soma with the Rab7 GTPase. Further, <i>Vps29 </i>phenotypes are suppressed by reducing Rab7 or overexpressing the GTPase activating protein, TBC1D5. With aging, retromer insufficiency triggers progressive endolysosomal dysfunction, with ultrastructural evidence of impaired substrate clearance and lysosomal stress. Our results reveal the role of Vps29 in retromer localization and function, highlighting requirements for brain homeostasis in aging.

Much of the early visual system is devoted to sifting the visual scene for the few bits of behaviorally relevant information. In the visual cortex of mammals a hierarchical system of brain areas leads eventually to the selective encoding of important features, like faces and objects. Here we report that a similar process occurs in the other major visual pathway, the superior colliculus. We investigate the visual response properties of collicular neurons in the awake mouse with large-scale electrophysiology. Compared to the superficial collicular layers, neuronal responses in the deeper layers become more selective for behaviorally relevant stimuli; more invariant to location of stimuli in the visual field; and more suppressed by repeated occurrence of a stimulus in the same location. The memory of familiar stimuli persists in complete absence of the visual cortex. Models of these neural computations lead to specific predictions for neural circuitry in the superior colliculus.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49834">Reinforcement biases subsequent perceptual decisions when confidence is low: a widespread behavioral phenomenon</a></h4>

Learning from successes and failures often improves the quality of subsequent decisions. Past outcomes, however, should not influence purely perceptual decisions after task acquisition is complete since these are designed so that only sensory evidence determines the correct choice. Yet, numerous studies report that outcomes can bias perceptual decisions, causing spurious changes in choice behavior without improving accuracy. Here we show that the effects of reward on perceptual decisions are principled: past rewards bias future choices specifically when previous choice was difficult and hence decision confidence was low. We identified this phenomenon in six datasets from four laboratories, across mice, rats, and humans, and sensory modalities from olfaction and audition to vision. We show that this choice-updating strategy can be explained by reinforcement learning models incorporating statistical decision confidence into their teaching signals. Thus, despite being suboptimal from the experimenter’s perspective, confidence-guided reinforcement learning optimizes behavior in uncertain, real-world situations.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease but currently has no effective treatment. Growing evidence suggests that proteome homeostasis underlies ALS pathogenesis. Protein production, trafficking, and degradation all shape the proteome. We present a hypothesis that proposes all genetic lesions associated with ALS (including in mRNA-binding proteins) cause widespread imbalance to an already metastable proteome. The impact of such dysfunction is felt across the entire proteome and is not restricted to a small subset of proteins.

Steinberg et al. investigate how connections between the central amygdala and the lateral substantia nigra contribute to emotional behaviors. They find that amygdalonigral neurons are activated by salient stimuli and participate in appetitive and aversive learning via connections with nigral GABA and dopamine neurons.

Szczurkowska et al. show that during neuronal polarization, directed mechanisms determine apical dendrite development in embryonic pyramidal neurons. The scaffolding protein Scribble assembles a localized cGMP-synthesis complex in dendrites. The complex is necessary for apical dendrite development in the embryonic hippocampus.

Ohba et al. show that overexpressed PGAM1 in gliomas binds to the cytoplasmic phosphatase WIP1 and prevents its nuclear translocation and dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing PGAM1 releases WIP1 to translocate to the nucleus, resulting in a decrease in ATM signaling and an increase in therapeutic efficacy of irradiation and chemotherapy in glioma.

Peter et al. show that the SHISA6 protein modulates the synaptic function of Purkinje cells in mice. In the absence of SHISA6, memory formation during classical eyeblink conditioning and eye movement adaptations is severely impaired as a result of a major synaptic excitability phenotype in Purkinje cells.

Combining quantitative live-cell microscopy and single-cell sequencing with pharmacological perturbation, Benary et al. disentangle the dynamic requirements of EGF-induced MAPK and PI3K activity during mitogenic signaling. They corroborate that both pathways are necessary to induce S-phase entry and show that only PI3K is needed to drive replication by metabolic adjustments.

Langenberg et al. show that amyloid propensity favors protein stability. This results from the energetic correlation of mutation in the native and amyloid state. The genetic code tightens this relationship so that stable amyloidogenic sequences are deeply conserved. Positive selection of amyloidogenic sequences could therefore have favored the evolution of globular structure.

This interplay involves stimulation of mitochondrial activity through direct interaction with VDAC1/GRP75 and glutaminolysis via the ATF4/PCK2 pathway.

Campinho et al. show that cell extrusion associated with hematopoietic stem cell generation in the ventral dorsal aorta is under the control of blood flow-dependent tissue mechanics. The mechanosensitive channel trpp2 and blood flow limit endothelial cell extrusion originating from the endothelium during the process.

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) patients with no gross residual disease (R0) after primary surgery have the greatest improvement in clinical outcomes. A deep understanding of molecular and cellular heterogeneity of HGSC is lacking. Findings by Lee et al. highlight major molecular and cellular differences between clinically defined subgroups of HGSC.

Škop et al. show that the mouse dark-phase thermoneutral zone is a thermoneutral point (TNP), defined as a discrete ambient temperature below which energy expenditure increases and above which body temperature increases. The mouse TNP changes diurnally by ∼4°C. Thus, studying mice strictly “at thermoneutrality” is not feasible.

A preovulatory LH surge induces the expression of PGR and the production of PGE2, a proinflammatory prostaglandin, in preovulatory granulosa cells. Park et al. show that PGR then suppresses PGE2 synthesis by decreasing the expression of PTGS2. Such PGR-driven termination temporarily confines ovulatory inflammation within a short period.

Nogo-66, the extracellular domain of Nogo-A, has been identified as the most important myelin-associated neuronal growth inhibitor. Evidence suggested that Nogo-66 exert its neurite inhibition effect via a Nogo-66/Protein kinase B (PKB)/Glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta})/tau signaling pathway. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine kinase mediating axon upstream growth of PKB and GSK-3{beta}. However, the contribution of ILK to the Nogo-66-induced inhibition of neurite, is not clear. In this study, we set out to reveal the role of ILK on Nogo-66 signaling in vitro and in vivo. To deteremine this directly, Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed to upregulate or downregulate the expresioon of ILK in Neuro 2a (N2a))and analysis the change of downstream molecule and neurite length. The results showed that Nogo-66 inhibited the phosphorylation of ILK, while ILK regulated the phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3{beta}, and the expression of tau in Nogo-66-treated N2a cells. ILK overexpression through lentivirus vector transfection reduced the inhibitory effect of neurite outgrowth induced by Nogo-66 in cortical neurons. The Tau expression in the complete spinal cord transection rat model was promoted by the overexpression of ILK. Our findings indicated that ILK is a key signal factor involved in Nogo-66-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth. The mechanism of Nogo-66 signaling pathway was further explained and a proper target for the promotion of neural regeneration was also provided by this study.

When choosing between options, such as food items presented in plain view, people tend to choose the option they spend longer looking at. The prevailing interpretation is that visual attention increases value. However, in previous studies, 'value' was coupled to a behavioural goal, since subjects had to choose the item they preferred. This makes it impossible to discern if visual attention has an effect on value, or, instead, if attention modulates the information most relevant for the goal of the decision-maker. Here we present the results of two independent studies - a perceptual and a value-based task - that allow us to decouple value from goal-relevant information using specific task-framing. Combining psychophysics with computational modelling, we show that, contrary to the current interpretation, attention does not boost value, but instead it modulates goal-relevant information. This work provides a novel and more general mechanism by which attention interacts with choice.

Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are neurodevelopmental disorders with overlapping symptomatology. Both show deficits in inhibitory control, which are associated with altered functioning and glutamate concentrations in the frontostriatal circuitry. These parameters have never been examined together. Here we, for the first time, used a multi-center, longitudinal approach to investigate fronto-striatal functioning during an inhibitory control task and its association with fronto-striatal glutamate concentrations across these two disorders. Methods: 74 adolescents with ASD (24) or OCD (15) and controls (35) aged 8-17 were recruited across three sites of the European TACTICS consortium. They underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions with a one-year interval. This included proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS; n=74) and functional MRI during an inhibitory control task (n=57). We used linear mixed effects models to investigate, over time, the relationship between fronto-striatal functioning and glutamate concentrations across these groups and continuous measures of overlapping compulsivity symptoms. Results: During failed inhibitory control, in OCD increased striatal glutamate was associated with increased neural activation of ACC, an effect that decreased over time. During successful inhibitory control, higher ACC glutamate was positively associated with striatal activation in OCD and compulsivity across time. ACC glutamate levels decreased over time in the ASD group compared to controls, while striatal glutamate decreased over time, independent of diagnosis. Conclusions: Significant differences in fronto-striatal glutamate were observed in ASD and OCD, affecting functional activity during failed- and successful inhibitory control differently, especially in OCD, with effects changing over time.

Reading-related responses in the lateral ventral temporal cortex (VTC) show a consistent spatial layout across individuals, which is puzzling, since reading skills are acquired during childhood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that white matter fascicles and gray matter microstructure predict the location of reading-related responses in lateral VTC. We obtained functional (fMRI), diffusion (dMRI), and quantitative (qMRI) magnetic resonance imaging data in 30 adults. fMRI was used to map reading-related responses by contrasting responses in a reading task with those in adding and color tasks; dMRI was used to identify the brain's fascicles and to map their endpoints density in lateral VTC; qMRI was used to measure proton relaxation time (T1), which depends on cortical tissue microstructure. We fit linear models that predict reading-related responses in lateral VTC from endpoint density and T1 and used leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess prediction accuracy. First, by using a subset of our participants (N=10, feature selection set), we find that i) endpoint density of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF) are significant predictors of reading-related responses, and ii) cortical T1 of lateral VTC further improves the predictions of the fascicle model. Next, in the remaining 20 participants (validation set), we showed that a linear model that includes T1, AF, ILF and VOF significantly predicts i) the map of reading-related responses across lateral VTC and ii) the location of the visual word form area, a region critical for reading. Overall, our data-driven approach reveals that the AF, ILF, VOF and cortical microstructure have a consistent spatial relationship with an individual's reading-related responses in lateral VTC.

Lesion symptom mapping (LSM) tools are used on brain injury data to identify the neural structures critical for a given behavior or symptom. Univariate lesion-symptom mapping (ULSM) methods provide statistical comparisons of behavioral test scores in patients with and without a lesion on a voxel by voxel basis. More recently, multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM) methods have been developed that consider the effects of all lesioned voxels in one model simultaneously. However, very little work has been done to empirically compare the advantages and disadvantages of these two different methods. In the current study, we provide a needed systematic comparison of 5 ULSM and 8 MLSM methods, using both synthetic and real data to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. We tested power and spatial precision of each LSM method for both single and dual (network type) anatomical target simulations across anatomical target location, sample size, noise level, and lesion smoothing. Additionally, we performed false positive simulations to identify the characteristics associated with each method's spurious findings. Simulations showed no clear superiority of either ULSM or MLSM methods overall, but rather highlighted specific advantages of different methods. No single method produced a thresholded LSM map that exclusively delineated brain regions associated with the target behavior. Thus, different LSM methods are indicated, depending on the particular study design, specific hypotheses, and sample size. Overall, we recommend the use of both ULSM and MLSM methods in tandem to enhance confidence in the results: Brain foci identified as significant across both types of methods are unlikely to be spurious and can be confidently reported as robust results.

As their illness progresses, patients with the semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) frequently exhibit peculiar behaviors indicative of altered visual attention or an increased interest in artistic endeavors. In the present study, we examined changes within and between large-scale functional brain networks that may explain this altered visual behavior. We first examined the connectivity of the visual association network, the dorsal attention network, and the default mode network in healthy young adults (n=89) to understand the typical architecture of these networks in the healthy brain. We then compared the large-scale functional connectivity of these networks in a group of svPPA patients (n=12) to a group of age-matched cognitively normal controls (n=30). Our results showed that the between-network connectivity of the dorsal attention and visual association networks was elevated in svPPA patients relative to controls. We further showed that this heightened between-network connectivity was associated with a decrease in the within-network connectivity of the default mode network, possibly due to progressive degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes in svPPA. These results suggest that focal neurodegeneration can lead to the reorganization of large-scale cognitive networks beyond the primarily affected network(s), possibly contributing to cognitive or behavioral changes that are commonly present as part of the clinical phenotype of svPPA.

The splanchnic-chromaffin cell synapse is the site at which stimulus-secretion coupling in the adrenal medulla is regulated. However, since the discovery that acetylcholine underlies chemical signaling at this synapse, attention has been disproportionately placed on postsynaptic chromaffin cell function. As a result, the determinants of Ca2+-sensing and exocytosis from splanchnic nerves remain poorly understood. This study shows, for the first time, that a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein, synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) is expressed within the neurons that innervate the adrenal medulla. In synapses that lack Syt7, evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are smaller in amplitude and decay with more rapid kinetics than wild-type synapses stimulated in an identical manner. EPSCs in Syt7-deficient adrenal slices also fail to facilitate, which is ordinarily a robust property of these synapses. These data are the first to implicate a role for Syt7 in regulating short-term synaptic plasticity in the peripheral nervous system.

Time has an integral role in episodic memory and previous work has implicated the medial temporal lobe in both representing time and discriminating between similar information. Here we developed a novel paradigm to test mnemonic discrimination for temporal duration, as previous work has largely focused on order or maintaining information over time. Thirty-five healthy, young adults completed a continuous-recognition, temporal discrimination task in which participants were tasked with detecting a change in stimulus duration on the order of 0.5 seconds. Whole-brain high-resolution fMRI data were acquired. Behavioral results indicate that participants were successful at detecting whether or not the stimulus duration changed. Further, fMRI analyses revealed that the left entorhinal and perirhinal cortices were differentially involved in encoding and retrieval, respectively. These findings support the notion of the entorhinal cortex being involved in the encoding of temporal context information as well as the perirhinal cortex representing the conjunction of item and context during retrieval.

Lesions to posterior temporo-parietal brain regions are associated with deficits in perception of global, hierarchical shapes, but also impairments in the processing of objects presented under demanding viewing conditions. Evidence from neuroimaging studies and lesion patterns observed in patients with simultanagnosia and agnosia for object orientation suggest similar brain regions to be involved in perception of global shapes and processing of objects in atypical (non-canonical) orientation. In a localizer experiment, we identified individual temporo-parietal brain areas involved in global shape perception and found significantly higher BOLD signals during the processing of non-canonical compared to canonical objects. In a multivariate approach, we demonstrated that posterior temporo-parietal brain areas show distinct voxel patterns for non-canonical and canonical objects and that voxel patterns of global shapes are more similar to those of objects in non-canonical compared to canonical viewing conditions. These results suggest that temporo-parietal brain areas are not only involved in global shape perception but might serve a more general mechanism of complex object perception. Our results challenge a strict attribution of object processing to the ventral visual stream by suggesting specific dorsal contributions in more demanding viewing conditions.

False memories are a common occurrence but the impact of misremembering on the original memory trace is ill-described. While the original memory may be rewritten, it is also possible for a second false memory to exist concurrently with the original, and if a false memory exists concurrently then recovery of the original information should be possible. This study investigates first, whether false recognition overwrites the original memory representation using a mnemonic discrimination task, and second, which neural processes are involved in recovering the original memory following a false memory. Thirty-five healthy, young adults performed multiple recognition memory tests, where the design of the experiment induced participants to make memory errors in the first recognition memory test and then allowed us to determine whether the memory error would be corrected in the second test session. FMRI signal associated with the encoding and retrieval processes during the experiment were investigated in order to determine the important regions for false memory correction. We found that false memories do not overwrite the original trace in all instances, as recovery of the original information was possible. Critically, we determined that recovery of the original information was dependent on higher-order processes during the formation of the false memory during the first test, and not on processing at the time of encoding or the second test episode.

L-lactate is an energetic and signaling molecule that is key to the metabolic and neuroplastic connection between astrocytes and neurons and may be involved in exercise-induced neuroplasticity. This study sought to explore the role of L-lactate in astrocyte reactivity and neuroplasticity. Using in vitro cultures of primary astrocytes, we show L-lactate increased expression of plasticity-related genes, including neurotrophic factors, Bdnf, Gdnf, Cntf and the immediate early gene cFos. L-lactate's promotion of neurotrophic factor expression may be mediated in part by the lactate receptor HCAR1 since application of the HCAR1 agonist 3,5-DHBA also increased expression of Bdnf in primary astrocytes. In vivo L-lactate administration to healthy mice caused a similar increase in the expression of plasticity-related genes as well as increased astrocyte morphological complexity in a region-specific manner, with increased astrocytic response found in the striatum but not the ectorhinal cortex, regions of the brain where increases in regional cerebral blood flow are increased or unaltered, respectively, with motor behavior. Additionally, L-lactate administration did not cause synaptogenesis or improve motor behavior based on the latency to fall on the accelerating rotarod, suggesting that L-lactate administration can initiate astrocyte-specific gene expression, but the activation of motor circuits is necessary to initiate striatal neuroplasticity. These results suggest that peripheral L-lactate is likely an important molecular component of exercise-induced neuroplasticity by acting in an astrocyte-specific manner to prime the brain for neuroplasticity.

The use of Neuropixels probes for chronic neural recordings in freely moving animals is not yet widespread. Stable chronic recording across months has been reported from a single brain area in rats, and probe re-use has been shown for mice after an implantation period of a few weeks. These initial studies raise three questions that need to be addressed for chronic recording from freely moving animals to become cost-effective and routine. First, how does long-term yield compare across different brain regions? Second, is it possible to achieve a cost-effective strategy for freely moving animals that is i) compact enough for multiple simultaneous probes to be implanted, ii) allows probe explantation and re-use, and, importantly, iii) is robust enough for stable multi-month recordings from rats (or other animals that can generate impact forces greater than those generated by mice)? Third, how does probe performance degrade after multiple cycles of implantation? Here we address these three questions, validating an approach for chronic Neuropixels recordings over a period of months, in freely moving rats performing a cognitively-demanding task. Daily recording sessions lasted up to five hours and required no human supervision. Our approach allows for implantation of multiple probes per rat and probe recovery at the end of the experiment. We found that, on average, hundreds of units can be recorded for multiple months. However, this long-term stability strongly depended on the dorsoventral and anteroposterior position in the brain, with greater stability in more anterior and ventral regions. Finally, we quantified degradation in the performance (input-referred noise) of explanted probes after each implantation and found this degradation to be insufficient to impair future single-unit recordings. We conclude that cost-effective, multi-region, and multi-probe Neuropixels recordings can be carried out with high yields over multiple months in rats or other similarly sized animals. Our methods and observations may facilitate the standardization of chronic recording from Neuropixels probes in freely moving animals.

Aging is the major risk factor for the development of dementia and neurodegenerative disorders, and the aging brain manifests severe deficits in buffering capacity by the proteostasis network. Accordingly, we investigated the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a major signaling pathway that copes with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, to normal mammalian brain aging. Genetic disruption of ER stress sensor IRE1 accelerated cognitive and motor dysfunction during aging. Exogenous bolstering of the UPR by overexpressing an active form of the transcription factor XBP1 restored synaptic and cognitive function in addition to reducing cell senescence. Remarkably, proteomic profiling of hippocampal tissue indicated that XBP1s expression corrected age-related alterations in synaptic function. Collectively, our data demonstrate that strategies to manipulate the UPR sustain healthy brain aging.

Autobiographical memory (AM) refers to recollected events that belong to an individual's past. In a classical episodic retrieval experiment in a laboratory, the events to be remembered are words or pictures that have hardly any personal relevance. While such stimuli provide necessary experimental and controlled conditions helping to advance in the understanding of memory, they do not capture the whole complexity of real-world stimuli. Recently, the incorporation of wearable cameras has allowed us to study the cognitive and neural bases of AM retrieval without active participant involvement, and they have been demonstrated to elicit a strong sense of first-person episodic recollection enhancing ecological validity. Here, we provide a new approach to understanding the retrieval of personal events, implementing a convolution network-based algorithm for the selection of the stimuli while monitoring participants' memory retrieval with scalp EEG recordings over three periods of time after encoding (1 week, 2 weeks, and 6 to 12 months). We also examined an individual with a condition termed Aphantasia that provided more insights into the sensitivity of our protocol in the investigation of individual AM using real-life sequences.

<p>by Anna Hutchinson, Hope Watson, Chris Wallace</p>

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci associated with human diseases. Bayesian genetic fine-mapping studies aim to identify the specific causal variants within GWAS loci responsible for each association, reporting credible sets of plausible causal variants, which are interpreted as containing the causal variant with some “coverage probability”. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that the coverage probabilities are over-conservative in most fine-mapping situations. We show that this is because fine-mapping data sets are not randomly selected from amongst all causal variants, but from amongst causal variants with larger effect sizes. We present a method to re-estimate the coverage of credible sets using rapid simulations based on the observed, or estimated, SNP correlation structure, we call this the “adjusted coverage estimate”. This is extended to find “adjusted credible sets”, which are the smallest set of variants such that their adjusted coverage estimate meets the target coverage. We use our method to improve the resolution of a fine-mapping study of type 1 diabetes. We found that in 27 out of 39 associated genomic regions our method could reduce the number of potentially causal variants to consider for follow-up, and found that none of the 95% or 99% credible sets required the inclusion of more variants—a pattern matched in simulations of well powered GWAS. Crucially, our method requires only GWAS summary statistics and remains accurate when SNP correlations are estimated from a large reference panel. Using our method to improve the resolution of fine-mapping studies will enable more efficient expenditure of resources in the follow-up process of annotating the variants in the credible set to determine the implicated genes and pathways in human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZTeJWkGsGCg" width="1" />

<p>by Marco Mauri, Jean-Luc Gouzé, Hidde de Jong, Eugenio Cinquemani</p>

Synthetic microbial consortia have been increasingly utilized in biotechnology and experimental evidence shows that suitably engineered consortia can outperform individual species in the synthesis of valuable products. Despite significant achievements, though, a quantitative understanding of the conditions that make this possible, and of the trade-offs due to the concurrent growth of multiple species, is still limited. In this work, we contribute to filling this gap by the investigation of a known prototypical synthetic consortium. A first <i>E. coli</i> strain, producing a heterologous protein, is sided by a second <i>E. coli</i> strain engineered to scavenge toxic byproducts, thus favoring the growth of the producer at the expense of diverting part of the resources to the growth of the cleaner. The simplicity of the consortium is ideal to perform an in depth-analysis and draw conclusions of more general interest. We develop a coarse-grained mathematical model that quantitatively accounts for literature data from different key growth phenotypes. Based on this, assuming growth in chemostat, we first investigate the conditions enabling stable coexistence of both strains and the effect of the metabolic load due to heterologous protein production. In these conditions, we establish when and to what extent the consortium outperforms the producer alone in terms of productivity. Finally, we show in chemostat as well as in a fed-batch scenario that gain in productivity comes at the price of a reduced yield, reflecting at the level of the consortium resource allocation trade-offs that are well-known for individual species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yUpRNtkUMDo" width="1" />

Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CDkfhRwyf0Y" width="1" />

<p>by Nicholas T. Franklin, Michael J. Frank</p>

Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order to act adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but it is unknown whether humans modulate their generalization strategy accordingly. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks that separately manipulate the statistics of goal values (“what to do”) and state transitions (“how to do it”) across contexts and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support a normative “meta-generalization” account and suggests that people not only generalize previous task components but also generalize the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkWq3zlKQgI" width="1" />

<p>by Christian Quirouette, Nada P. Younis, Micaela B. Reddy, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin</p>

Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But virus also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell’s beating cilia, the PCF and its virus content are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. While many mathematical models (MMs) have described the course of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection. The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down towards the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with IAV which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away IAV, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 μm/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT see more virus than lower parts. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It also captures the kinetics of seasonal and avian IAV infections, via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains, enabling comparison of their treatment with antivirals. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections within the HRT.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e50KlDmALV0" width="1" />

Microscopy image analysis is a major bottleneck in quantification of single-cell microscopy data, typically requiring human oversight and curation, which limit both accuracy and throughput. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction. Our analysis focuses on time-lapse movies of <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells trapped in a "mother machine" microfluidic device, a scalable platform for long-term single-cell analysis that is widely used in the field. While deep learning has been applied to cell segmentation problems before, our approach is fundamentally innovative in that it also uses machine learning to perform cell tracking and lineage reconstruction. With this framework we are able to get high fidelity results (1% error rate), without human intervention. Further, the algorithm is fast, with complete analysis of a typical frame containing ~150 cells taking &lt;700msec. The framework is not constrained to a particular experimental set up and has the potential to generalize to time-lapse images of other organisms or different experimental configurations. These advances open the door to a myriad of applications including real-time tracking of gene expression and high throughput analysis of strain libraries at single-cell resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhxcQeuqnCk" width="1" />

Studies of complex disorders benefit from integrative analyses of multiple omics data. Yet, sample mix-ups frequently occur in multi-omics studies, weakening statistical power and risking false findings. Accurately aligning sample information, genotype, and corresponding omics data is critical for integrative analyses. We developed DRAMS (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/DRAMS) to Detect and Re-Align Mixed-up Samples to address the sample mix-up problem. It uses a logistic regression model followed by a modified topological sorting algorithm to identify the potential true IDs based on data relationships of multi-omics. According to tests using simulated data, the more types of omics data used or the smaller the proportion of mix-ups, the better that DRAMS performs. Applying DRAMS to real data from the PsychENCODE BrainGVEX project, we detected and corrected 201 (12.5% of total data generated) mix-ups. Of the 21 mix-ups involving errors of racial identity, DRAMS re-assigned all data to the correct racial group in the 1000 Genomes project. In doing so, quantitative trait loci (QTL) (FDR&lt;0.01) increased by an average of 1.62-fold. The use of DRAMS in multi-omics studies will strengthen statistical power of the study and improve quality of the results. Even though very limited studies have multi-omics data in place, we expect such data will increase quickly with the needs of DRAMS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v735bzy17ts" width="1" />

<p>by Chloé Pasture, Anna Montagnini, Laurent Udo Perrinet</p>

Animal behavior constantly adapts to changes, for example when the statistical properties of the environment change unexpectedly. For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. It has already been shown that when a random sequence of motion ramps of a visual target is biased to one direction (e.g. right or left), human observers adapt their eye movements to accurately anticipate the target’s expected direction. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where the probability bias could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the explicit prediction of the next outcome as reported by observers using a rating scale. Both results were compared to the estimates of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the assumed generative model. Compared to the classical leaky integrator model, we found a better match between our probabilistic agent and the behavioral responses, both for the anticipatory eye movements and the explicit task. Furthermore, by controlling the level of preference between exploitation and exploration in the model, we were able to fit for each individual’s experimental dataset the most likely level of volatility and analyze inter-individual variability across participants. These results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still represent an internal belief about the environmental contingencies, and use this representation both for sensory-motor control and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test the diversity of human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bv9wsfV3c6Q" width="1" />

<p>by Miguel Brun-Usan, Christoph Thies, Richard A. Watson</p>

Cell differentiation in multicellular organisms requires cells to respond to complex combinations of extracellular cues, such as morphogen concentrations. Some models of phenotypic plasticity conceptualise the response as a relatively simple function of a single environmental cues (e.g. a linear function of one cue), which facilitates rigorous analysis. Conversely, more mechanistic models such those implementing GRNs allows for a more general class of response functions but makes analysis more difficult. Therefore, a general theory describing how cells integrate multi-dimensional signals is lacking. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between environmental cues (inputs) and phenotypic responses (outputs) underlying cell plasticity. We describe the relationship between environment and cell phenotype using logical functions, making the evolution of cell plasticity equivalent to a simple categorisation learning task. This abstraction allows us to apply principles derived from learning theory to understand the evolution of multi-dimensional plasticity. Our results show that natural selection is capable of discovering adaptive forms of cell plasticity associated with complex logical functions. However, developmental dynamics cause simpler functions to evolve more readily than complex ones. By using conceptual tools derived from learning theory we show that this developmental bias can be interpreted as a learning bias in the acquisition of plasticity functions. Because of that bias, the evolution of plasticity enables cells, under some circumstances, to display appropriate plastic responses to environmental conditions that they have not experienced in their evolutionary past. This is possible when the selective environment mirrors the bias of the developmental dynamics favouring the acquisition of simple plasticity functions–an example of the necessary conditions for generalisation in learning systems. These results illustrate the functional parallelisms between learning in neural networks and the action of natural selection on environmentally sensitive gene regulatory networks. This offers a theoretical framework for the evolution of plastic responses that integrate information from multiple cues, a phenomenon that underpins the evolution of multicellularity and developmental robustness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jVs6kVBFgC4" width="1" />

<p>by Yifei Guo, Rory John Bufacchi, Giacomo Novembre, Marina Kilintari, Massieh Moayedi, Li Hu, Gian Domenico Iannetti</p>

Nervous systems exploit regularities in the sensory environment to predict sensory input, adjust behavior, and thereby maximize fitness. Entrainment of neural oscillations allows retaining temporal regularities of sensory information, a prerequisite for prediction. Entrainment has been extensively described at the frequencies of periodic inputs most commonly present in visual and auditory landscapes (e.g., &gt;0.5 Hz). An open question is whether neural entrainment also occurs for regularities at much longer timescales. Here, we exploited the fact that the temporal dynamics of thermal stimuli in natural environment can unfold very slowly. We show that ultralow-frequency neural oscillations preserved a long-lasting trace of sensory information through neural entrainment to periodic thermo-nociceptive input as low as 0.1 Hz. Importantly, revealing the functional significance of this phenomenon, both power and phase of the entrainment predicted individual pain sensitivity. In contrast, periodic auditory input at the same ultralow frequency did not entrain ultralow-frequency oscillations. These results demonstrate that a functionally significant neural entrainment can occur at temporal scales far longer than those commonly explored. The non-supramodal nature of our results suggests that ultralow-frequency entrainment might be tuned to the temporal scale of the statistical regularities characteristic of different sensory modalities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KKPxATUxu5Q" width="1" />

<p>There has not been a major change in how neuroscientists approach stereotaxic methods in decades. Here, we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D-printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: (1) a three-pole cannula apparatus, (2) an optrode-electrode assembly, (3) a fixed-electrode array, and (4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to nine months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in computer aided design (CAD) software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R">Progressive multiple sclerosis is associated with faster and specific retinal layer atrophy</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear if retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The estimated proportion of peri‐papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in MS attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/year; p &lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/year; p &lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:‐0.09 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.03; ONL:‐0.12 ± 0.06%/year, p = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:‐0.10 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.01; ONL:‐0.13 ± 0.05%/year, p = 0.01), while they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS, that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this invited review, we argue for the need to determine whether appetitive and aversive behaviors, be they goal‐directed or habitual, share overlapping neural circuitry. To motivate our argument, we first summarize what is currently known about the neural circuits governing aversive and appetitive behaviors by focusing first on the three hypothesized phases of avoidance learning, and then on goal‐directed and habitual reward seeking. We then provide several reasons to believe that the neural circuits of appetitive and aversive instrumental behaviors are not completely overlapping. We next discuss an experimental strategy to determine the extent of overlap based on a new computational framework that improves the identification of goal‐directed and habitual actions regardless of valence. Finally, we discuss recent work in obsessive‐compulsive disorder that uses this computational framework to determine whether patients perform appetitive and aversive versions of the same task using the same behavioral strategies and neural circuits.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. While post‐mortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established pre‐mortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 who responded by March 2019.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Despite being a post‐mortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3%, versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a post‐mortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. While underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.</p>

Multiple trials of aversive olfactory conditioning in Drosophila can form an aversive memory for one odor and an unexpected safety memory for the other. Although safety memory appears slowly after training, it lasts longer than aversive memory.

Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can enhance memory consolidation. It is currently unknown whether TMR reinforced by simultaneous tDCS has superior efficacy. In this study, we investigated the complementary effect of TMR and bilateral tDCS on the consolidation of emotionally neutral and negative declarative memories. Participants learned neutral and negative word pairs. Each word pair was presented with an emotionally compatible sound. Following learning, participants spent a 20-minutes retention interval awake under 4 possible conditions: (1) TMR alone (i.e. replay of 50% of the associated sounds), (2) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC, (3) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the right DLPFC and (4) TMR with sham tDCS. Results evidenced selective memory enhancement for the replayed stimuli in the TMR-only and TMR-sham conditions, which confirms a specific effect of TMR on memory. However, memory was enhanced at higher levels for all learned items (irrespective of TMR) in the TMR-anodal right and TMR-anodal left tDCS conditions, suggesting that the beneficial effects of tDCS overshadow the specific effects of TMR. Emotionally negative memories were not modulated by tDCS hemispheric polarity. We conclude that electrical stimulation of the DLPFC during post-learning period globally benefits memory consolidation, but does not potentiate the specific benefits of TMR.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are promising tools for assisting patients with paralysis, but suffer from long training times and variable user proficiency. Mind-body awareness training (MBAT) can improve BCI learning, but how it does so remains unknown. Here we show that MBAT allows participants to learn to volitionally increase alpha band neural activity during BCI tasks that incorporate intentional rest. We trained individuals in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; a standardized MBAT intervention) and compared performance and brain activity before and after training between randomly assigned trained and untrained control groups. The MBAT group showed reliably faster learning of BCI than the control group throughout training. Alpha-band activity in EEG signals, recorded in the volitional resting state during task performance, showed a parallel increase over sessions, and predicted final BCI performance. The level of alpha-band activity during the intentional resting state correlated reliably with individuals' mindfulness practice as well as performance on a sustained attention task. Collectively, these results show that MBAT modifies a specific neural signal used by BCI. MBAT, by increasing patients' control over their brain activity during rest, may increase the effectiveness of BCI in the large population who could benefit from alternatives to direct motor control.

Naming a color can be understood as an act of categorization, i.e. identifying it as a member of a category of colors that are referred to by the same name. But are naming and categorization equivalent cognitive processes, and consequently rely on the same neural substrates? Here, we used task and resting-state fMRI, as well as behavioral measures to identify functional brain networks that are modulated by naming and categorization of colors. Color naming and categorization performance differentially modulated resting-state connectivity networks spanning from the color-sensitive regions in the ventro-occipital cortex. Color naming response times were correlated with the connectivity between the left posterior Color region, the left medial temporal gyrus, and the left angular gyrus; whereas color categorization involved the connectivity between the bilateral posterior Color regions, the left frontal, right temporal and bilateral parietal areas. The networks supporting naming and categorization did not overlap, suggesting that the two processes rely on different neural mechanisms.

Single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) methods are used as an alternative to single cell RNA-Seq methods, as they allow transcriptomic profiling of frozen tissue. However, it is unclear whether snRNA-Seq is able to detect cellular state. Indeed, snRNA-Seq analyses of human brain samples have failed to detect a consistent microglial activation signature in Alzheimer's Disease. A comparison of microglia from single cells and single nuclei of four human subjects reveals that ~1% of genes is depleted in nuclei compared to whole cells. This small population contains 18% of genes previously implicated in microglial activation, including APOE, CST3, FTL, SPP1, and CD74. We confirm our findings across multiple previous single nucleus and single cell studies. Given the low sensitivity of snRNA-Seq to this population of activation genes, we conclude that snRNA-Seq is not suited to detecting cellular activation in microglia in human disease.

Orienting movements are essential to sensory-guided reward-seeking behaviors. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to exert top-down control over a range of goal-directed behaviors and is hypothesized to bias sensory-guided movements. However, the nature of PFC involvement in controlling sensory-guided orienting behaviors has remained largely unknown. Here, we trained rats on a delayed two-alternative forced-choice task requiring them to hold an orienting decision in working memory before execution is cued. Medial PFC (mPFC) Inactivation using either Muscimol or optogenetics impaired choice behavior. However, optogenetic impairment depended on the specific trial epoch during which inactivation took place. In particular, we found a lateralized role for mPFC during the presentation of instruction cues but this role became bilateral when inactivation occurred later in the delay period. Electrophysiological recording of multiple single-unit activity further provided evidence that this lateralized selectivity is cell-type specific. Our results suggest a previously unknown role of mPFC in mediating sensory-guided representation of orienting behavior and a potentially distinct cell-type specific role in shaping such representation across time.

The transition from controlled drug use to drug addiction depends on an interaction between a vulnerable individual, their environment and a drug. However, the determining factors of this interaction remain elusive. We show in rats that the environment influences the acquisition of drug intake through its effect on behavioral markers of resilience to addiction. In contrast, the development of both compulsive cocaine and alcohol intake is facilitated by the experiential factors associated with the initiation of drug taking in a negative, deprived, state occasioned by the contrast between enriched housing conditions and a relatively impoverished drug-taking setting. Similarly, the acquisition of alcohol drinking as a coping strategy promotes the development of compulsive intake. These data demonstrate that addiction vulnerability lies in environmentally determined experiential factors.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25739?af=R">Frontotemporal dementia: correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TDP‐43, tau, and FUS. With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (<i>P</i> = 0.02), including but not limited to <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (<i>P</i> = 0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Non rapid eye movement sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
<p>We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography at immediate, 30‐min and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of non‐rapid eye movement sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors such as age and epilepsy duration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30min and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13/min was associated with impaired memory retention over 1‐week.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The praying mantis is a good model for the study of motor control, especially for investigating the transformation from sensory signals into motor commands. In insects, thoracic ganglia (TG) play an important role in motor control. To understand the functional organization of TG, an atlas is useful. However, except for the fruitfly, no three‐dimensional atlas of TG has not been reported for insects. In this study, we generated a three‐dimensional atlas of prothoracic, mesothoracic, and metathoracic ganglia in the praying mantis (<i>Tenodera aridifolia</i>). First, we observed serial sections of the prothoracic ganglion stained with hematoxylin and eosin to identify longitudinal tracts and transverse commissures. We then visualized neuropil areas by immunostaining whole‐mount TG with an anti‐synapsin antibody. Before labeling each neuropil area, standardization using the iterative shape averaging method was applied to images to make neuropil contours distinct. Neuropil areas in TG were defined based on their shape and relative position to tracts and commissures. Finally, a three‐dimensional atlas was reconstructed from standardized images of the TG. The standard TG are available at the Comparative Neuroscience Platform website (<a href="http://cns.neuroinf.jp" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">cns.neuroinf.jp</a>/modules/xoonips/detail.php?item_id=11946) and can be used as a common reference map to combine the anatomical data obtained from different individuals.</p>

<p>Parasol cells are one of the major types of retinal ganglion cells, and they give rise to the magnocellular stream of visual information processing. They respond well to moving and other rapidly changing stimuli in their receptive field. They also respond to stimuli outside of their classical receptive fields, and this article is about the inhibitory local circuits that mediate those responses, wide‐field amacrine cells. The parasol cells (orange, light blue, yellow, and pink) were reconstructed from a connectome of central macaque retina, as were dendrites of the presynaptic wide field amacrine cells. Three wide field amacrine cells were wiry type 2 cells (dark blue, salmon, and green), amacrine cells with active dendrites. The locations of their synapses onto parasol cells are circled.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parasol cells are one of the major types of primate retinal ganglion cells. The goal of this study was to describe the synaptic inputs that shape the light responses of the ON type of parasol cells, which are excited by increments in light intensity. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy. Six neighboring ON parasol cells were reconstructed, and their synaptic inputs were analyzed. On average, they received 21% of their input from bipolar cells, excitatory local circuit neurons receiving input from cones. The majority of their input was from amacrine cells, local circuit neurons of the inner retina that are typically inhibitory. Their contributions to the neural circuit providing input to parasol cells are not well‐understood, and the focus of this study was on the presynaptic wide‐field amacrine cells, which provided 17% of the input to ON parasol cells. These are GABAergic amacrine cells with long, relatively straight dendrites, and sometimes also axons, that run in a single, narrow stratum of the inner plexiform layer. The presynaptic wide‐field amacrine cells were reconstructed, and two types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. One presynaptic amacrine cell was identified as semilunar type 2, a polyaxonal cell that is electrically coupled to ON parasol cells. A second amacrine was identified as wiry type 2, a type known to be sensitive to motion. These inputs likely make ON parasol cells more sensitive to stimuli that are rapidly changing outside their classical receptive fields.</p>

<p>Tvrm4 rhodopsin mutant mice undergo rapid photoreceptor loss upon bright light exposure. Early consequences on the inner retina involve mainly second‐order neurons and include quick dendritic retraction and axonal shrinkage in rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and, later, in cone BCs and the presence of anomalous globular synaptic ribbons (GR). Yet, BC survival is nearly 100% and retinal architecture is overall well preserved. Hence, early remodeling in this adult mutant is moderate and similar to what observed in developmental paradigms of retinitis pigmentosa.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rod‐cone degenerations, for example, retinitis pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness worldwide. Despite slow disease progression in humans, vision loss is inevitable; therefore, development of vision restoration strategies is crucial. Among others, promising approaches include optogenetics and prosthetic implants, which aim to bypass lost photoreceptors (PRs). Naturally, the efficacy of these therapeutic strategies will depend on inner retinal structural and functional preservation. The present study shows that in photoinducible I307N rhodopsin mice (Translational Vision Research Model 4 [Tvrm4]), a 12k lux light exposure eliminates PRs in the central retina in 1 week, but interneurons and their synapses are maintained for as long as 9 weeks postinduction. Despite bipolar cell dendritic retraction and moderate loss of horizontal cells, the survival rate of various cell types is very high. Significant preservation of conventional synapses and gap junctions in the inner plexiform layer is also observed. We found the number of synaptic ribbons to gradually decline and their ultrastructure to become transiently abnormal, although based on our findings intrinsic retinal architecture is maintained despite complete loss of PRs. Unlike common rodent models of PR degeneration, where the disease phenotype often interferes with retinal development, in Tvrm4 mice, the degenerative process can be induced after retinal development is complete. This time course more closely mimics the timing of disease onset in affected patients. Stability of the inner retina found in these mutants 2 months after PR degeneration suggests moderate, stereotyped remodeling in the early stages of the human disease and represents a promising finding for prompt approaches of vision restoration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>ATP is the major excitatory transmitter from chemoreceptor type I cells to sensory nerve endings in the carotid body, and has been suggested to be released by exocytosis from these cells. We investigated the mRNA expression and immunohistochemical localization of vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) in the rat carotid body. RT‐PCR detected mRNA expression of VNUT in extracts of the tissue. Immunoreactivity for VNUT was localized in a part of type I cells immunoreactive for synaptophysin (SYN), but not in glial‐like type II cells immunoreactive for S100 and S100B. Among SYN‐immunoreactive type I cells, VNUT immunoreactivity was selectively localized in the sub‐population of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐immunorective type I cells associated with nerve endings immunoreactive for the P2X3 purinoceptor; however, it was not detected in the sub‐population of type I cells immunoreactive for dopamine beta‐hydroxylase. Multi‐immunolabeling for VNUT, P2X3, and Bassoon revealed that Bassoon‐immunoreactive products were localized in type I cells with VNUT immunoreactivity, and accumulated on the contact side of P2X3‐immunoreactive nerve endings. These results revealed the selective localization of VNUT in the subpopulation of TH‐immunoreactive type I cells attached to sensory nerve endings and suggested that these cells release ATP by exocytosis for chemosensory transmission in the carotid body.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The spiny mouse (<i>Acomys cahirinus)</i> appears to be unique among mammals by showing little scarring or fibrosis after skin or muscle injury, but the <i>Acomys</i> response to spinal cord injury (SCI) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that <i>Acomys</i> would have molecular and immunohistochemical evidence of reduced spinal inflammation and fibrosis following SCI as compared to C57BL/6 mice (<i>Mus</i>), which similar to all mammals studied to date exhibits spinal scarring following SCI. Initial experiments used two pathway‐focused RT‐PCR gene arrays (“wound healing” and “neurogenesis”) to evaluate tissue samples from the C2–C6 spinal cord 3 days after a C3/C4 hemi‐crush injury (C3Hc). Based on the gene array results, specific genes were selected for RT‐qPCR evaluation using species‐specific primers. The results supported our hypothesis by showing increased inflammation and fibrosis related gene expression (<i>Serpine 1</i>, <i>Plau</i>, and <i>Timp1)</i> in <i>Mus</i> as compared to <i>Acomys</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). RT‐qPCR also showed enhanced stem cell and axonal guidance related gene expression <i>(Bmp2</i>, <i>GDNF</i>, and <i>Shh)</i> in <i>Acomys</i> compared to <i>Mus</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Immunohistochemical evaluation of the spinal lesion at 4 weeks postinjury indicated less collagen IV immunostaining in <i>Acomys</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(IBA1) immunostaining indicated morphological differences in the appearance of astrocytes and macrophages/microglia in <i>Acomys</i>. Collectively, the molecular and histologic results support the hypothesis that <i>Acomys</i> has reduced spinal inflammation and fibrosis following SCI. We suggest that <i>Acomys</i> may be a useful comparative model to study adaptive responses to SCI.</p>

<p>Here we use immunohistochemistry to show that the degenerating retina of the cavefish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is marked by two important features. First, the neuroretina contains all cell types commonly see in the circuit. Presumably these components will later degenerate as the lens dies. Second, the outer segments of the photoreceptors are already malformed from early stages of development. It is interesting to note how evolution has severed a cell in half.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The teleost <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is one species extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish, they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and two independently adapted of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Müller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.</p>

Depletion of miR‐183/96 in early onset mice degenerated photoreceptor and in vitro overexpression of miR‐183 cluster (recombinant constructs) could trigger reprogramming of the human retinal pigment epithelial cells to photoreceptor cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) play important roles in posttranscriptional processes to regulate gene expression. MiRNAs control various biological processes, such as growth, development, and differentiation. The continuous physiological function of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium requires precise regulation to maintain their homeostasis and function; hence, these cells are highly susceptible to premature death in retinal degenerative disorders. MiRNAs are essential for the retinal cell maturation and function; the miR‐183 cluster represents one of the most important regulatory factors for the photoreceptor cells. Various studies together with bioinformatics analyses have shown that many genes contributing to the differentiation pathway of photoreceptors are targets of the miR‐183 cluster, and the miR‐183 cluster dysregulation causes certain defects in the differentiation of the photoreceptors and other retinal neurons by influencing the expression of target genes. Misexpression of miR‐183 cluster in the human retinal epithelial cells leads to the reprogramming and transformation of these cells to neuron‐ and photoreceptor‐like cells, which are associated with the expression of neuron‐ and photoreceptor‐specific markers in human retinal pigment epitheliums cells. The knockout of this cluster causes the destruction of the outer segment of the photoreceptors, which subsequently causes the cells to exhibit severe susceptibility to light and eventually degenerate. Hundreds of target genes in this family are likely to affect the development and maintenance of the retina. Identifying the genes that are regulated by the miRNA‐183 cluster provides researchers with important insights into the complex development and regeneration mechanism of the retina and may offer a new way for maintaining and regenerating photoreceptor cells in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pan‐tropic cleaner shrimp <i>Stenopus hispidus</i> (Crustacea, Stenopodidea) is famous for its specific cleaning behavior in association with client fish and an exclusively monogamous life‐style. Cleaner shrimps feature a broad communicative repertoire, which is considered to depend on superb motor skills and the underlying mechanosensory circuits in combination with sensory organs. Their most prominent head appendages are the two pairs of very long biramous antennules and antennae, which are used both for attracting client fish and for intraspecific communication. Here, we studied the brain anatomy of several specimens of <i>S. hispidus</i> using histological sections, immunohistochemical labeling as well as X‐ray microtomography in combination with 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, we investigated the morphology of antennules and antennae using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Our analyses show that in addition to the complex organization of the multimodal processing centers, especially chemomechanosensory neuropils associated with the antennule and antenna are markedly pronounced when compared to the other neuropils of the central brain. We suggest that in their brains, three topographic maps are present corresponding to the sensory appendages. The brain areas which provide the neuronal substrate for these maps share distinct structural similarities to a unique extent in decapods, such as size and characteristic striated and perpendicular layering. We discuss our findings with respect to the sensory landscape within animal's habitat. In an evolutionary perspective, the cleaner shrimp's brain is an excellent example of how sensory potential and functional demands shape the architecture of primary chemomechanosensory processing areas.</p>

<p>Identification, by immunohistochemistry, of the different photoreceptor families present in the <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> turtle retina. (a) External segment of L cones labeled with α‐ZF labeled red opsin antibody. The marking performed allowed to identify both classes of red cones (R) and double cones (DC). The red cones have red or orange oil droplets (OD) and the DC cones have orange OD. (b) External segment of M cones labeled with α‐ZF green opsin antibody. The specified antibody allowed identifying the whole population of green cones (G), with yellow (y) OD. (c) The identification of ultraviolet (UV) and blue (B) cones and rods (ROD) was performed from an overlap showing the difference between UV cones (single oblique arrow), S cones (single horizontal arrow) and rods (double arrows), the difference is due to the absence of OD in the rods. The S cones present blue fluorescent (bf) OD (at 488 nm laser) and UV cones present nonfluorescent colorless (nfc) OD. Scale bar: 30 mm. Photoreceptors schemes modified from the previous study.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We have identified the photoreceptors of <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i>, an intensely studied species that is a model for color vision work. To recognize and count the different photoreceptor types, we labeled them with a combination of morphological and immunohistochemistry markers. The counts for the determination of the density of each photoreceptor type were made in wholemount retinas. The percentages found for each cone type were 29, 23, 21, 12, and 6%, respectively, for L (both types), double, M, S, and ultraviolet cones. The cones were found to be organized horizontally in a visual streak, a linear region with a higher density of photoreceptors that ends temporally in the periphery and more centrally in the nasal side. This region of high density of photoreceptors was not symmetrical along its extension; there was a region with conspicuous central density peaks in the temporal area, suggestive of an area centralis. We also observed a dorsoventral asymmetry in photoreceptor density, with greater density in the ventral region. This asymmetry was observed in cones and rods, but it was more pronounced in the rods. Our results corroborate and extend the findings of previous work in the literature describing the retinal photoreceptors of <i>T. s. elegans</i> and their spatial organization. The higher cone density within the visual streak reflects increased spatial resolution and its existence suggests the possibility of binocular vision. It is remarkable that within this region the entire potential for color vision is also present.</p>

<p>In this study, we examine how new adult‐born neurons are generated in the crayfish brain. We describe previously undetected symmetric divisions of neurogenic niche cells and follow their daughters as they generate multiple progeny by asymmetric divisions and migrate as expanding clones toward target brain areas. We reinterpret the cells composing the niche as a pseudostratified neuroepithelium with features reminiscent of interkinetic nuclear migration. Based on this, we present a novel model of adult neurogenesis that proposes intrinsic cell proliferation as well as hemocyte integration to compensate for the niche cell loss as neural progenitors migrate away. Parallels with mechanisms of adult neurogenesis in mammalian systems are highlighted.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Two decades after the discovery of adult‐born neurons in the brains of decapod crustaceans, the deutocerebral proliferative system (DPS) producing these neural lineages has become a model of adult neurogenesis in invertebrates. Studies on crayfish have provided substantial insights into the anatomy, cellular dynamics, and regulation of the DPS. Contrary to traditional thinking, recent evidence suggests that the neurogenic niche in the crayfish DPS lacks self‐renewing stem cells, its cell pool being instead sustained via integration of hemocytes generated by the innate immune system. Here, we investigated the origin, division and migration patterns of the adult‐born neural progenitor (NP) lineages in detail. We show that the niche cell pool is not only replenished by hemocyte integration but also by limited numbers of symmetric cell divisions with some characteristics reminiscent of interkinetic nuclear migration. Once specified in the niche, first generation NPs act as transit‐amplifying intermediate NPs that eventually exit and produce multicellular clones as they move along migratory streams toward target brain areas. Different clones may migrate simultaneously in the streams but occupy separate tracks and show spatio‐temporally flexible division patterns. Based on this, we propose an extended DPS model that emphasizes structural similarities to pseudostratified neuroepithelia in other arthropods and vertebrates. This model includes hemocyte integration and intrinsic cell proliferation to synergistically counteract niche cell pool depletion during the animal's lifespan. Further, we discuss parallels to recent findings on mammalian adult neurogenesis, as both systems seem to exhibit a similar decoupling of proliferative replenishment divisions and consuming neurogenic divisions.</p>

<p>Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialized retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark <i>Heterodontus portusjacksoni</i>, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm<sup>−2</sup>) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm<sup>−2</sup>) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> was 3.14 cycles deg<sup>−1</sup>, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> is well adapted for nocturnal vision.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a mental illness which is harmful seriously to the society. This study investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in hippocampus of the depressed rats to explore the new target structure of antidepressants. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were used to build chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) depressed model of rats. Then, the depressed rats were divided into the CUS standard group and the CUS + fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) group. The CUS/FLX group was treated with fluoxetine at dose of 5 mg/(kg·d) from the fifth week to seventh week. After 7 weeks CUS intervention, the sucrose preference of the CUS standard group was significantly lower than that of the control group and the CUS/FLX group. The stereological results showed that the total number of the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1, CA3, and DG subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group were significantly decreased, when compared with the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the control group. However, the total number of the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group was significantly decreased when it compared with CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CUS/FLX group. Therefore, fluoxetine might prevent the loss of CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus of the depressed rats. The oligodendrocytes in hippocampus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The current result might provide structural basis for the future studies that search for new antidepressant strategies.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between LDL cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically‐elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides) using independent genome‐wide significant SNPs for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all p&lt;1x10<sup>‐100</sup>). While one standard deviation increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85‐0.99; <i>p</i>=0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81‐0.95; <i>p</i>=0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both p&gt;0.05). Mendelian Randomization analyses indicated that 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) increase of genetically‐instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.65‐0.98; <i>p</i>=0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR 0.59; 95%CI 0.42‐0.82; <i>p</i>=0.002), respectively.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH.</p>

<p>by Loïc Marrec, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

The evolution of antimicrobial resistance can be strongly affected by variations of antimicrobial concentration. Here, we study the impact of periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial on resistance evolution in a microbial population, using a stochastic model that includes variations of both population composition and size, and fully incorporates stochastic population extinctions. We show that fast alternations of presence and absence of antimicrobial are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population and strongly favor the establishment of resistance, unless the antimicrobial increases enough the death rate. We further demonstrate that if the period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial population goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not rescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is eradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations. Rescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if they appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment. Importantly, the latter case is fully prevented by perfect biostatic antimicrobials that completely stop division of sensitive microorganisms. By contrast, we show that the parameter regime where treatment is efficient is larger for biocidal drugs than for biostatic drugs. This sheds light on the respective merits of different antimicrobial modes of action.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FzN99y_HHm0" width="1" />

<p>by Augusto Anguita-Ruiz, Alberto Segura-Delgado, Rafael Alcalá, Concepción M. Aguilera, Jesús Alcalá-Fdez</p>

Until date, several machine learning approaches have been proposed for the dynamic modeling of temporal omics data. Although they have yielded impressive results in terms of model accuracy and predictive ability, most of these applications are based on “Black-box” algorithms and more interpretable models have been claimed by the research community. The recent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) revolution offers a solution for this issue, were rule-based approaches are highly suitable for explanatory purposes. The further integration of the data mining process along with functional-annotation and pathway analyses is an additional way towards more explanatory and biologically soundness models. In this paper, we present a novel rule-based XAI strategy (including pre-processing, knowledge-extraction and functional validation) for finding biologically relevant sequential patterns from longitudinal human gene expression data (GED). To illustrate the performance of our pipeline, we work on <i>in vivo</i> temporal GED collected within the course of a long-term dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (GSE77962). As validation populations, we employ three independent datasets following the same experimental design. As a result, we validate primarily extracted gene patterns and prove the goodness of our strategy for the mining of biologically relevant gene-gene temporal relations. Our whole pipeline has been gathered under open-source software and could be easily extended to other human temporal GED applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxEAvEP_3rw" width="1" />

<p>by Pablo Rodríguez-Sínchez, Egbert H. Van Nes, Marten Scheffer</p>

Stability landscapes are useful for understanding the properties of dynamical systems. These landscapes can be calculated from the system’s dynamical equations using the physical concept of scalar potential. Unfortunately, it is well known that for most systems with two or more state variables such potentials do not exist. Here we use an analogy with art to provide an accessible explanation of why this happens and briefly review some of the possible alternatives. Additionally, we introduce a novel and simple computational tool that implements one of those solutions: the decomposition of the differential equations into a gradient term, that has an associated potential, and a non-gradient term, that lacks it. In regions of the state space where the magnitude of the non-gradient term is small compared to the gradient part, we use the gradient term to approximate the potential as quasi-potential. The non-gradient to gradient ratio can be used to estimate the local error introduced by our approximation. Both the algorithm and a ready-to-use implementation in the form of an R package are provided.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6kMIiATtZHs" width="1" />

<p>by Neythen J. Treloar, Alex J. H. Fedorec, Brian Ingalls, Chris P. Barnes</p>

Multi-species microbial communities are widespread in natural ecosystems. When employed for biomanufacturing, engineered synthetic communities have shown increased productivity in comparison with monocultures and allow for the reduction of metabolic load by compartmentalising bioprocesses between multiple sub-populations. Despite these benefits, co-cultures are rarely used in practice because control over the constituent species of an assembled community has proven challenging. Here we demonstrate, <i>in silico</i>, the efficacy of an approach from artificial intelligence—reinforcement learning—for the control of co-cultures within continuous bioreactors. We confirm that feedback via a trained reinforcement learning agent can be used to maintain populations at target levels, and that model-free performance with bang-bang control can outperform a traditional proportional integral controller with continuous control, when faced with infrequent sampling. Further, we demonstrate that a satisfactory control policy can be learned in one twenty-four hour experiment by running five bioreactors in parallel. Finally, we show that reinforcement learning can directly optimise the output of a co-culture bioprocess. Overall, reinforcement learning is a promising technique for the control of microbial communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EZVzHlzJKjo" width="1" />

<p>by Yangqing Deng, Wei Pan</p>

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS and PrediXcan) have been increasingly applied to detect associations between genetically predicted gene expressions and GWAS traits, which may suggest, however do not completely determine, causal genes for GWAS traits, due to the likely violation of their imposed strong assumptions for causal inference. Testing colocalization moves it closer to establishing causal relationships: if a GWAS trait and a gene’s expression share the same associated SNP, it may suggest a regulatory (and thus putative causal) role of the SNP medicated through the gene on the GWAS trait. Accordingly, it is of interest to develop and apply various colocalization testing approaches. The existing approaches may each have some severe limitations. For instance, some methods test the null hypothesis that there is colocalization, which is not ideal because often the null hypothesis cannot be rejected simply due to limited statistical power (with too small sample sizes). Some other methods arbitrarily restrict the maximum number of causal SNPs in a locus, which may lead to loss of power in the presence of wide-spread allelic heterogeneity. Importantly, most methods cannot be applied to either GWAS/eQTL summary statistics or cases with more than two possibly correlated traits. Here we present a simple and general approach based on conditional analysis of a locus on multiple traits, overcoming the above and other shortcomings of the existing methods. We demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our new method can be applied to a wider range of scenarios and often perform better. We showcase its applications to both simulated and real data, including a large-scale Alzheimer’s disease GWAS summary dataset and a gene expression dataset, and a large-scale blood lipid GWAS summary association dataset. An R package “jointsum” implementing the proposed method is publicly available at github.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X5AKR64ZCtk" width="1" />

Precision oncology has primarily relied on coding mutations as biomarkers of response to therapies. While transcriptome analysis can provide valuable information, incorporation into workflows has been difficult. For example, the relative rather than absolute gene expression level needs to be considered, requiring differential expression analysis across samples. However, expression programs related to the cell-of-origin and tumor microenvironment effects confound the search for cancer-specific expression changes. To address these challenges, we developed an unsupervised clustering approach for discovering differential pathway expression within cancer cohorts using gene expression measurements. The hydra approach uses a Dirichlet process mixture model to automatically detect multimodally distributed genes and expression signatures without the need for matched normal tissue. We demonstrate that the hydra approach is more sensitive than widely-used gene set enrichment approaches for detecting multimodal expression signatures. Application of the hydra analysis framework to small blue round cell tumors (including rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma) identified expression signatures associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment. The hydra approach also identified an association between <i>ATRX</i> deletions and elevated immune marker expression in high-risk neuroblastoma. Notably, hydra analysis of all small blue round cell tumors revealed similar subtypes, characterized by changes to infiltrating immune and stromal expression signatures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3f0I3ie1vpQ" width="1" />

<p>by David F. Little, Joel S. Snyder, Mounya Elhilali</p>

Perceptual bistability—the spontaneous, irregular fluctuation of perception between two interpretations of a stimulus—occurs when observing a large variety of ambiguous stimulus configurations. This phenomenon has the potential to serve as a tool for, among other things, understanding how function varies across individuals due to the large individual differences that manifest during perceptual bistability. Yet it remains difficult to interpret the functional processes at work, without knowing where bistability arises during perception. In this study we explore the hypothesis that bistability originates from multiple sources distributed across the perceptual hierarchy. We develop a hierarchical model of auditory processing comprised of three distinct levels: a Peripheral, tonotopic analysis, a Central analysis computing features found more centrally in the auditory system, and an Object analysis, where sounds are segmented into different streams. We model bistable perception within this system by applying adaptation, inhibition and noise into one or all of the three levels of the hierarchy. We evaluate a large ensemble of variations of this hierarchical model, where each model has a different configuration of adaptation, inhibition and noise. This approach avoids the assumption that a single configuration must be invoked to explain the data. Each model is evaluated based on its ability to replicate two hallmarks of bistability during auditory streaming: the selectivity of bistability to specific stimulus configurations, and the characteristic log-normal pattern of perceptual switches. Consistent with a distributed origin, a broad range of model parameters across this hierarchy lead to a plausible form of perceptual bistability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N1GrRito7qo" width="1" />

<p>by Guido Maiello, Manuela Chessa, Peter J. Bex, Fabio Solari</p>

The human visual system is foveated: we can see fine spatial details in central vision, whereas resolution is poor in our peripheral visual field, and this loss of resolution follows an approximately logarithmic decrease. Additionally, our brain organizes visual input in polar coordinates. Therefore, the image projection occurring between retina and primary visual cortex can be mathematically described by the log-polar transform. Here, we test and model how this space-variant visual processing affects how we process binocular disparity, a key component of human depth perception. We observe that the fovea preferentially processes disparities at fine spatial scales, whereas the visual periphery is tuned for coarse spatial scales, in line with the naturally occurring distributions of depths and disparities in the real-world. We further show that the visual system integrates disparity information across the visual field, in a near-optimal fashion. We develop a foveated, log-polar model that mimics the processing of depth information in primary visual cortex and that can process disparity directly in the cortical domain representation. This model takes real images as input and recreates the observed topography of human disparity sensitivity. Our findings support the notion that our foveated, binocular visual system has been moulded by the statistics of our visual environment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0piufpx5arc" width="1" />

The development of novel analgesics with improved safety profiles to combat the opioid epidemic represents a central question to G protein coupled receptor structural biology and pharmacology: What chemical features dictate G protein or β-arrestin signaling? Here we use adaptively biased molecular dynamics simulations to determine how fentanyl, a potent β-arrestin biased agonist, binds the μ-opioid receptor (μOR). The resulting fentanyl-bound pose provides rational insight into a wealth of historical structure-activity-relationship on its chemical scaffold. Following an in-silico derived hypothesis we found that fentanyl and the synthetic opioid peptide DAMGO require M153 to induce β-arrestin coupling, while M153 was dispensable for G protein coupling. We propose and validate an activation mechanism where the n-aniline ring of fentanyl mediates μOR β-arrestin through a novel M153 “microswitch” by synthesizing fentanyl-based derivatives that exhibit complete, clinically desirable, G protein biased coupling. Together, these results provide molecular insight into fentanyl mediated β-arrestin biased signaling and a rational framework for further optimization of fentanyl-based analgesics with improved safety profiles.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CkJXXUV_S5w" width="1" />

Accurate manipulation of metabolites in monolignol biosynthesis is a key step for controlling lignin content, structure, and other wood properties important to the bioenergy and biomaterial industries. A crucial component of this strategy is predicting how single and combinatorial knockdowns of monolignol specific gene transcripts influence the abundance of monolignol proteins, which are the driving mechanisms of monolignol biosynthesis. Computational models have been developed to estimate protein abundances from transcript perturbations of monolignol specific genes. The accuracy of these models, however, is hindered by their inability to capture indirect regulatory influences on other pathway genes. Here, we examine the manifestation of these indirect influences on transgenic transcript and protein abundances, identifying putative indirect regulatory influences that occur when one or more specific monolignol pathway genes are perturbed. We created a computational model using sparse maximum likelihood to estimate the resulting monolignol transcript and protein abundances in transgenic <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> based on targeted knockdowns of specific monolignol genes. Using <i>in-silico</i> simulations of this model and root mean square error, we showed that our model more accurately estimated transcript and protein abundances, in comparison to previous models, when individual and families of monolignol genes were perturbed. We leveraged insight from the inferred network structure obtained from our model to identify potential genes, including <i>PtrHCT</i>, <i>PtrCAD</i>, and <i>Ptr4CL</i>, involved in post-transcriptional and/or post-translational regulation. Our model provides a useful computational tool for exploring the cascaded impact of single and combinatorial modifications of monolignol specific genes on lignin and other wood properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/posucfjp_EY" width="1" />

DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification that plays an essential role in mammalian development. Genomic methylation patterns are dynamically maintained, with DNA methyltransferases mediating inheritance of methyl marks onto nascent DNA over cycles of replication. A recently developed experimental technique employing immunoprecipitation of bromodeoxyuridine labeled nascent DNA followed by bisulfite sequencing (Repli-BS) measures post-replication temporal evolution of cytosine methylation, thus enabling genome-wide monitoring of methylation maintenance. In this work, we combine statistical analysis and stochastic mathematical modeling to analyze Repli-BS data from human embryonic stem cells. We estimate site-specific kinetic rate constants for the restoration of methyl marks on &gt;10 million uniquely mapped cytosines within the CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) dinucleotide context across the genome using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We find that post-replication remethylation rate constants span approximately two orders of magnitude, with half-lives of per-site recovery of steady-state methylation levels ranging from shorter than ten minutes to five hours and longer. Furthermore, we find that kinetic constants of maintenance methylation are correlated among neighboring CpG sites. Stochastic mathematical modeling provides insight to the biological mechanisms underlying the inference results, suggesting that enzyme processivity and/or collaboration can produce the observed kinetic correlations. Our combined statistical/mathematical modeling approach expands the utility of genomic datasets and disentangles heterogeneity in methylation patterns arising from replication-associated temporal dynamics versus stable cell-to-cell differences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x4NZ8btGDwI" width="1" />

<p>by Jian Heng, Peng Lv, Yifan Zhang, Xinjie Cheng, Lu Wang, Dongyuan Ma, Feng Liu</p>

It is well known that various developmental signals play diverse roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) production; however, how these signaling pathways are orchestrated remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that Rab5c is essential for HSPC specification by endocytic trafficking of Notch and AKT signaling in zebrafish embryos. Rab5c deficiency leads to defects in HSPC production. Mechanistically, Rab5c regulates hemogenic endothelium (HE) specification by endocytic trafficking of Notch ligands and receptor. We further show that the interaction between Rab5c and Appl1 in the endosome is required for the survival of HE in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta through AKT signaling. Interestingly, Rab5c overactivation can also lead to defects in HSPC production, which is attributed to excessive endolysosomal trafficking inducing Notch signaling defect. Taken together, our findings establish a previously unrecognized role of Rab5c-mediated endocytic trafficking in HSPC development and provide new insights into how spatiotemporal signals are orchestrated to accurately execute cell fate transition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3grO__e7BHw" width="1" />

5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the most prevalent intermediate on the oxidative DNA demethylation pathway and is implicated in regulation of embryogenesis, neurological processes, and cancerogenesis. Profiling of this relatively scarce genomic modification in clinical samples requires cost-effective high-resolution techniques that avoid harsh chemical treatment. Here, we present a bisulfite-free approach for 5hmC profiling at single-nucleotide resolution, named hmTOP-seq (5hmC-specific tethered oligonucleotide–primed sequencing), which is based on direct sequence readout primed at covalently labeled 5hmC sites from an in situ tethered DNA oligonucleotide. Examination of distinct conjugation chemistries suggested a structural model for the tether-directed nonhomologous polymerase priming enabling theoretical evaluation of suitable tethers at the design stage. The hmTOP-seq procedure was optimized and validated on a small model genome and mouse embryonic stem cells, which allowed construction of single-nucleotide 5hmC maps reflecting subtle differences in strand-specific CG hydroxymethylation. Collectively, hmTOP-seq provides a new valuable tool for cost-effective and precise identification of 5hmC in characterizing its biological role and epigenetic changes associated with human disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gTHTldw7j58" width="1" />

The correct subcellular distribution of proteins establishes the complex morphology and function of neurons. Fluorescence microscopy techniques are invaluable to investigate subcellular protein distribution, but they suffer from the limited ability to efficiently and reliably label endogenous proteins with fluorescent probes. We developed ORANGE: Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing, which mediates targeted genomic integration of epitope tags in rodent dissociated neuronal culture, in organotypic slices, and in vivo. ORANGE includes a knock-in library for in-depth investigation of endogenous protein distribution, viral vectors, and a detailed two-step cloning protocol to develop knock-ins for novel targets. Using ORANGE with (live-cell) superresolution microscopy, we revealed the dynamic nanoscale organization of endogenous neurotransmitter receptors and synaptic scaffolding proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized proteins. Finally, we developed a mechanism to create multiple knock-ins in neurons, mediating multiplex imaging of endogenous proteins. Thus, ORANGE enables quantification of expression, distribution, and dynamics for virtually any protein in neurons at nanoscale resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gHdYOFd1lD8" width="1" />

<p>Transformations between sensory representations are shaped by neural mechanisms at the cellular and the circuit level. In the insect olfactory system, the encoding of odor information undergoes a transition from a dense spatiotemporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odor representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odor representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes spatiotemporal odor representations, which are optimized for the discrimination of odors during stimulus onset and offset. Response pattern correlation across different stimuli showed a nonmonotonic dependence on the strength of lateral inhibition with an optimum at intermediate levels, which is explained by two counteracting mechanisms. In addition, we find that odor identity is stored on a prolonged timescale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odor trace.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during neurodegeneration. Here we aimed to study brain gyrification differences between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with memory and other cognitive functions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We applied surface‐based morphometry techniques in two large, independent cross‐sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, were analyzed independently.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed in the two samples.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We additionally speculate with alternative mechanisms that may also alter its folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Assess occurrence of the dendritic spine scaffolding protein drebrin as a pathophysiologically relevant autoantibody target in patients with recurrent seizures and suspected encephalitis as leading symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sera of 4 patients with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis of unresolved etiology and equivalent results in autoantibody screening were subjected to epitope identification. We combined a wide array of approaches, ranging from immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, subcellular binding pattern analyses in primary neuronal cultures, and immunohistochemistry in brains of wild‐type and drebrin knockout mice to in vitro analyses of impaired synapse formation, morphology, and aberrant neuronal excitability by antibody exposure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the serum of a patient with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis, a strong signal at ∼70kDa was detected by immunoblotting, for which mass spectrometry revealed drebrin as the putative antigen. Three other patients whose sera also showed strong immunoreactivity around 70kDa on Western blotting were also anti‐Drebrin‐positive. Seizures, memory impairment, and increased protein content in cerebrospinal fluid occurred in anti‐Drebrin‐seropositive patients. Alterations in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging comprised amygdalohippocampal T2‐signal increase and hippocampal sclerosis. Diagnostic biopsy revealed T‐lymphocytic encephalitis in an anti‐Drebrin‐seropositive patient. Exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to anti‐Drebrin autoantibodies resulted in aberrant synapse composition and drebrin distribution as well as increased spike rates and the emergence of burst discharges reflecting network hyperexcitability.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Anti‐drebrin autoantibodies define a chronic syndrome of recurrent seizures and neuropsychiatric impairment as well as inflammation of limbic and occasionally cortical structures. Immunosuppressant therapies should be considered in this disorder. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Observational studies have shown alcohol drinking behaviors may be associated with the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but contradictory findings have emerged, and whether such an association is causal is unclear. We here investigate the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and ALS. By leveraging instruments from large‐scale genome‐wide association studies, we performed a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis and found alcohol consumption was causally associated with ALS, leading to ∼1.5‐fold (95% confidence interval = 1.4–3.4) higher risk of ALS for each ∼10g/day increase in alcohol intake. Our findings suggest accumulative alcohol consumption may serve as a crucial risk factor in the pathogenesis of ALS. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue‐target associations, and subsequently were scanned using ultra‐high‐field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the associated or not‐associated time intervals. When temporal expectations were met during testing trials, activity in left and right hippocampal subfields and right putamen decreased, compared to when temporal expectations were not met. Further, psycho‐physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left hippocampal subfields and caudate decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal‐striatal network in temporal associative processing.</p>

<p>Action real-time strategy gaming (ARSG) is a cognitively demanding task which requires attention, sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities. A recent study found that ARSG experts had superior visual selective attention (VSA) for detecting the location of a moving object that could appear in one of 24 different peripheral locations (Qiu et al., 2018), suggesting that ARSG experience is related to improvements in the spatial component of VSA. However, the influence of ARSG experience on the temporal component of VSA—the detection of an item among a sequence of items presented consecutively and quickly at a single location—still remains understudied. Using behavioral and electrophysiological measures, this study examined whether ARSG experts had superior temporal VSA performance compared to non-experts in an attentional blink (AB) task, which is typically used to examine temporal VSA. The results showed that the experts outperformed the non-experts in their detection rates of targets. Furthermore, compared to the non-experts, the experts had faster information processing as indicated by earlier P3 peak latencies in an AB period, more attentional resources distributed to targets as indicated by stronger P3 amplitudes, and a more flexible deployment of attentional resources. These findings suggest that experts were less prone to the AB effect. Thus, long-term ARSG experience is related to improvements in temporal VSA. The current findings support the benefit of video gaming experience on the development of VSA.</p>

To compare findings across species, neuroscience relies on cross-species homologies, particularly in terms of brain areas. For cingulate cortex, a structure implicated in behavioural adaptation and control, a homologous definition across mammals is available – but currently not employed by most rodent researchers. The standard partitioning of rodent cingulate cortex is inconsistent with that in any other model species, including humans. Reviewing the existing literature, we show that the homologous definition better aligns results of rodent studies with those of other species, and reveals a clearer structural and functional organisation within rodent cingulate cortex itself.

The co-localization of Cluster-of-Differentiation-44 protein (CD44) and cytoplasmic adaptors in specific membrane environments is crucial for cell adhesion and migration. The process is controlled by two different pathways: On the one hand palmitoylation keeps CD44 in lipid raft domains and disables the linking to the cytoplasmic adaptor, whereas on the other hand, the presence of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) lipids accelerates the formation of the CD44-adaptor complex. The molecular mechanism explaining how CD44 is migrating into and out of the lipid raft domains and its dependence on both palmitoylations and the presence of PIP2 remains, however, elusive. In this study, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study the raft affinity and translocation of CD44 in phase separated model membranes as well as more realistic plasma membrane environments. We observe a delicate balance between the influence of the palmitoylations and the presence of PIP2 lipids: whereas the palmitoylations of CD44 increases the affinity for raft domains, PIP2 lipids have the opposite effect. Additionally, we studied the association between CD44 and the membrane adaptor FERM in dependence of these factors. We find that the presence of PIP2 lipids allows CD44 and FERM to associate in an experimentally observed binding mode whereas the highly palmitoylated species shows no binding affinity. Together, our results shed light on the sophisticated mechanism on how membrane translocation and peripheral protein association can be controlled by both protein modifications and membrane composition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uwRwfeq_96o" width="1" />

<p>by Shiva Kamkar, Fatemeh Ghezloo, Hamid Abrishami Moghaddam, Ali Borji, Reza Lashgari</p>

Humans are able to track multiple objects at any given time in their daily activities—for example, we can drive a car while monitoring obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Several past studies have examined how humans track targets simultaneously and what underlying behavioral and neural mechanisms they use. At the same time, computer-vision researchers have proposed different algorithms to track multiple targets automatically. These algorithms are useful for video surveillance, team-sport analysis, video analysis, video summarization, and human–computer interaction. Although there are several efficient biologically inspired algorithms in artificial intelligence, the human multiple-target tracking (MTT) ability is rarely imitated in computer-vision algorithms. In this paper, we review MTT studies in neuroscience and biologically inspired MTT methods in computer vision and discuss the ways in which they can be seen as complementary.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PRe5iXfghCo" width="1" />

<p>by Simone Carlo Surace, Jean-Pascal Pfister, Wulfram Gerstner, Johanni Brea</p>

This is a <i>PLOS Computational Biology</i> Education paper.
The idea that the brain functions so as to minimize certain costs pervades theoretical neuroscience. Because a cost function by itself does not predict how the brain finds its minima, additional assumptions about the optimization method need to be made to predict the dynamics of physiological quantities. In this context, steepest descent (also called gradient descent) is often suggested as an algorithmic principle of optimization potentially implemented by the brain. In practice, researchers often consider the vector of partial derivatives as the gradient. However, the definition of the gradient and the notion of a steepest direction depend on the choice of a metric. Because the choice of the metric involves a large number of degrees of freedom, the predictive power of models that are based on gradient descent must be called into question, unless there are strong constraints on the choice of the metric. Here, we provide a didactic review of the mathematics of gradient descent, illustrate common pitfalls of using gradient descent as a principle of brain function with examples from the literature, and propose ways forward to constrain the metric.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXmPsakotaM" width="1" />

Chemokines and their receptors are orchestrators of cell migration in humans. Because dysregulation of the receptor-chemokine system leads to inflammation and cancer, both chemokines and receptors are highly sought therapeutic targets. Yet one of the barriers for their therapeutic targeting is the limited understanding of the structural principles behind receptor-chemokine recognition and selectivity. The existing structures do not include CXC subfamily complexes and lack information about the receptor distal N-termini, despite the importance of the latter in signaling, regulation, and bias. Here, we report the discovery of the geometry of the complex between full-length CXCR4, a prototypical CXC receptor and driver of cancer metastasis, and its endogenous ligand CXCL12. By comprehensive disulfide cross-linking, we establish the existence and the structure of a novel interface between the CXCR4 distal N-terminus and CXCL12 β1-strand, while also recapitulating earlier findings from nuclear magnetic resonance, modeling and crystallography of homologous receptors. A cross-linking–informed high-resolution model of the CXCR4-CXCL12 complex pinpoints the interaction determinants and reveals the occupancy of the receptor major subpocket by the CXCL12 proximal N terminus. This newly found positioning of the chemokine proximal N-terminus provides a structural explanation of CXC receptor-chemokine selectivity against other subfamilies. Our findings challenge the traditional two-site understanding of receptor-chemokine recognition, suggest the possibility of new affinity and signaling determinants, and fill a critical void on the structural map of an important class of therapeutic targets. These results will aid the rational design of selective chemokine-receptor targeting small molecules and biologics with novel pharmacology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SCircO8PAXE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogen synthesis and signaling in the brains of vertebrates has pleotropic effects ranging from neurogenesis to modulation of behaviors. The majority of studies on brain‐derived estrogens focus on males, but estrogenic signaling in females likely plays important roles in regulation of reproductive cycling and social behaviors. We used females of the mouth brooding African cichlid fish, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, to test for reproductive state‐dependent changes in estrogenic signaling capacity within microdissected brain nuclei that are important for social behaviors. Expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme aromatase, but not estrogen receptors, measured by qPCR changes across the reproductive cycle. Gravid females that are close to spawning had higher aromatase levels in all brain regions compared to females with lower reproductive potential. This brain aromatase expression was positively correlated with circulating estradiol levels and ovarian readiness. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization we localized aromatase‐expressing cells to ependymal regions bordering the ventricles from the forebrain to the hindbrain, and observed more abundant staining in gravid compared to mouth brooding females in most regions. Staining was most prominent in subpallial telencephalic regions, and diencephalic regions of the preoptic area, thalamus, and hypothalamus, but was also observed in sensory and sensorimotor areas of the midbrain and hindbrain. Aromatase expression was observed in radial glial cells, revealed by co‐localization with the glial marker GFAP and absence of co‐localization with the neuronal marker HuC/D. Collectively these results support the idea that brain‐derived estradiol in females may serve important functions in reproductive state‐dependent physiological and behavioral processes across vertebrates.</p>

<p>In contrast with other vertebrate species, vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position. Our data indicate that missense mutations in Crb1 and Cyfip2 are responsible for aberrant morphology and ectopic position of CSF‐cNs in C57Bl/6N mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSF‐cNs) represent a specific class of neurons located in close vicinity of brain ventricles and central canal. In contrast with knowledge gained from other vertebrate species, we found that vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position. However, we found that small number of ectopic CSF‐cNs is present also in spinal cord of other investigated experimental mice strains (C57Bl/6J, Balb/C) and mammalian species (Wistar rats, New Zealand White rabbits). Similarly, as the proximal populations, ectopic CSF‐cNs retain PKD2L1‐immunoreactivity and synaptic contacts with other neurons. On the other side, they show rather multipolar morphology lacking thick dendrite contacting central canal lumen. Ectopic CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice emerge during whole period devoted to production of CSF‐cNs and reach their ventral destinations during first postnatal weeks. In order to identify major gene, whose impairment could trigger translocation of CSF‐cNs outside the central canal area, we took advantage of close consanguinity of C57Bl/6J substrain with normal CSF‐cN distribution and C57Bl/6N substrain with majority of CSF‐cNs in ectopic position. Employing in silico analyses, we ranked polymorphisms in C57Bl/6N substrain and selected genes <i>Crb1, Cyfip2</i>, <i>Adamts12</i>, <i>Plk1</i>, and <i>Herpud2</i> as the most probable candidates, whose product dysfunction might be responsible for the ectopic distribution of CSF‐cNs. Furthermore, segregation analysis of F2 progeny of parental C57Bl/6N and Balb/C mice revealed that polymorphic loci of <i>Crb1 </i>and <i>Cyfip2</i> underlie the ectopic position of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vagal afferent sensory nerves, originating in jugular and nodose ganglia, are composed of functionally distinct subsets whose activation evokes distinct thoracic and abdominal reflex responses. We used Cre-expressing mouse strains to identify specific vagal afferent populations and map their central projections within the brainstem. We show that Pirt is expressed in virtually all vagal afferents; whereas, 5-HT3 is expressed only in nodose neurons, with little expression in jugular neurons. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), the capsaicin receptor, is expressed in a subset of small nodose and jugular neurons. Tac1, the gene for tachykinins, is expressed predominantly in jugular neurons, some of which also express TRPV1. Vagal fibers project centrally to the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), paratrigeminal complex, area postrema, and to a limited extent the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. nTS subnuclei preferentially receive projections by specific afferent subsets, with TRPV1<sup>+</sup> fibers terminating in medial and dorsal regions predominantly caudal of obex, whereas TRPV1<sup>–</sup> fibers terminate in ventral and lateral regions throughout the rostral–caudal aspect of the medulla. Many vagal Tac1<sup>+</sup> afferents (mostly derived from the jugular ganglion) terminate in the nTS. The paratrigeminal complex was the target of multiple vagal afferent subsets. Importantly, lung-specific TRPV1<sup>+</sup> and Tac1<sup>+</sup> afferent terminations were restricted to the caudal medial nTS, with no innervation of other medulla regions. In summary, this study identifies the specific medulla regions innervated by vagal afferent subsets. The distinct terminations provide a neuroanatomic substrate for the diverse range of reflexes initiated by vagal afferent activation.</p>

<p>Even when we are wearing gloves, we can easily detect whether a surface that we are touching is sticky or not. However, we know little about the similarities between brain activations elicited by this glove contact and by direct contact with our bare skin. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated which brain regions represent stickiness intensity information obtained in both touch conditions, i.e., skin contact and glove contact. First, we searched for neural representations mediating stickiness for each touch condition separately and found regions responding to both mainly in the supramarginal gyrus and the secondary somatosensory cortex. Second, we explored whether surface stickiness is encoded in common neural patterns irrespective of how participants touched the sticky stimuli. Using a cross-condition decoding method, we tested whether the stickiness intensities could be decoded from fMRI signals evoked by skin contact using a classifier trained on the responses elicited by glove contact, and vice versa. Our results found shared neural encoding patterns in the bilateral angular gyri and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and suggest that these areas represent stickiness intensity information regardless of how participants touched the sticky stimuli. Interestingly, we observed that neural encoding patterns of these areas were reflected in participants’ intensity ratings. This study revealed common and distinct brain activation patterns of tactile stickiness using two different touch conditions, which may broaden the understanding of neural mechanisms related to surface texture perception.</p>

<p>Proteomics analysis of the progressively ageing rat substantia nigra revealed proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidative‐reduction are dysregulated by middle age.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is a strong correlation between aging and onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but little is known about whether cellular changes occur during normal aging that may explain this association. Here, proteomic and bioinformatic analysis was conducted on the substantia nigra (SN) of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidation‐reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was identified as a network hub connecting the greatest number of proteins altered during aging. Furthermore, the isoform of GFAP expressed in the SN varied throughout life. However, the expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SN pars compact(SNc) as aging progressed. This age‐related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons, since increased dopamine production would be an additional source of oxidative stress. This, in turn, would place a high demand on support systems from local astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat SN, each of which converges upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.</p>

<p>This review surveys physiological, behavioral, and morphological evidence converging to the view of the cerebro-cerebellum as loci of internal forward models. The cerebro-cerebellum, the phylogenetically newest expansion in the cerebellum, receives convergent inputs from cortical, subcortical, and spinal sources, and is thought to perform the predictive computation for both motor control, motor learning, and cognitive functions. This predictive computation is known as an internal forward model. First, we elucidate the theoretical foundations of an internal forward model and its role in motor control and motor learning within the framework of the optimal feedback control model. Then, we discuss a neural mechanism that generates various patterns of outputs from the cerebro-cerebellum. Three lines of supporting evidence for the internal-forward-model hypothesis are presented in detail. First, we provide physiological evidence that the cerebellar outputs (activities of dentate nucleus cells) are predictive for the cerebellar inputs [activities of mossy fibers (MFs)]. Second, we provide behavioral evidence that a component of movement kinematics is predictive for target motion in control subjects but lags behind a target motion in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Third, we provide morphological evidence that the cerebellar cortex and the dentate nucleus receive separate MF projections, a prerequisite for optimal estimation. Finally, we speculate that the predictive computation in the cerebro-cerebellum could be deployed to not only motor control but also to non-motor, cognitive functions. This review concludes that the predictive computation of the internal forward model is the unifying algorithmic principle for understanding diverse functions played by the cerebro-cerebellum.</p>

<p>Music-based therapy for rehabilitation induces neuromodulation at the brain level and improves the functional recovery. In line with this, musical rhythmicity improves post-stroke gait. Moreover, an external distractor also helps stroke patients to improve locomotion. We raised the question whether music with irregular tempo (arrhythmic music), and its possible influence on attention would induce neuromodulation and improve the post-stroke gait. We tested music-induced neuromodulation at the level of a propriospinal reflex, known to be particularly involved in the control of stabilized locomotion; after stroke, the reflex is enhanced on the hemiparetic side. The study was conducted in 12 post-stroke patients and 12 controls. Quadriceps EMG was conditioned by electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve, which produces a biphasic facilitation on EMG, reflecting the level of activity of the propriospinal reflex between ankle dorsiflexors and quadriceps (CPQ reflex). The CPQ reflex was tested during treadmill locomotion at the preferred speed of each individual, in 3 conditions randomly alternated: without music vs. 2 arrhythmic music tracks, including a pleasant melody and unpleasant aleatory electronic sounds (AES); biomechanical and physiological parameters were also investigated. The CPQ reflex was significantly larger in patients during walking without sound, compared to controls. During walking with music, irrespective of the theme, there was no more difference between groups. In controls, music had no influence on the size of CPQ reflex. In patients, CPQ reflex was significantly larger during walking without sound than when listening to the melody or AES. No significant differences have been revealed concerning the biomechanical and the physiological parameters in both groups. Arrhythmic music listening modulates the spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring the CPQ reflex activity to normality. The plasticity was not accompanied by any clear improvement of gait parameters, but the patients reported to prefer walking with music than without. The role of music as external focus of attention is discussed. This study has shown that music can modulate propriospinal neural network particularly involved in the gait control during the first training session. It is speculated that repetition may help to consolidate plasticity and would contribute to gait recovery after stroke.</p>

<p>Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with ASD and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA’s Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.</p>

<p>Individuals with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) have atypical white matter integrity and neural connectivity in the brain, including language pathways. To explore functional activity associated with auditory and language processing in individuals with TSC, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine basic auditory correlates of detection (P1, N2, N4) and discrimination (mismatch negativity, MMN) of speech and non-speech stimuli for children with TSC and age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. Children with TSC (TSC group) and without TSC (typically developing, TD group) participated in an auditory MMN paradigm containing two blocks of vowels (/a/and/u/) and two blocks of tones (800 Hz and 400 Hz). Continuous EEG data were collected. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to explore functional specificity of neural auditory processing. Speech-specific P1, N2, and N4 waveform components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) were compared, and the mismatch response was calculated for both speech and tones. MVPA showed that the TD group, but not the TSC group, demonstrated above-chance pairwise decoding between speech and tones. The AEP component analysis suggested that while the TD group had an increased P1 amplitude in response to vowels compared to tones, the TSC group did not show this enhanced response to vowels. Additionally, the TD group had a greater N2 amplitude in response to vowels, but not tones, compared to the TSC group. The TSC group also demonstrated a longer N4 latency to vowels compared to tones, which was not seen in the TD group. No group differences were observed in the MMN response. In this study we identified features of the auditory response to speech sounds, but not acoustically matched tones, which differentiate children with TSC from TD children.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammatory processes play an integral role in the exacerbation and progression of pathology in tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disease characterized by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The RNA binding protein (RBP) T-cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA1) is an important regulator of the innate immune response in the periphery, dampening cytotoxic inflammation and apoptosis during cellular stress, however, its role in neuroinflammation is unknown. We have recently shown that TIA1 regulates tau pathophysiology and toxicity in part through the binding of phospho-tau oligomers into pathological stress granules, and that haploinsufficiency of TIA1 in the P301S mouse model of tauopathy results in reduced accumulation of toxic tau oligomers, pathologic stress granules, and the development of downstream pathological features of tauopathy. The putative role of TIA1 as a regulator of the peripheral immune response led us to investigate the effects of TIA1 on neuroinflammation in the context of tauopathy, a chronic stressor in the neural environment. Here, we evaluated indicators of neuroinflammation including; reactive microgliosis and phagocytosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons and glia of wildtype and P301S transgenic mice expressing TIA1<sup>+/+</sup>, TIA1<sup>+/–</sup>, and TIA1<sup>–/–</sup> in both early (5 month) and advanced (9 month) disease states through biochemical, ultrastructural, and histological analyses. Our data show that both TIA1 haploinsufficiency and TIA1 knockout exacerbate neuroinflammatory processes in advanced stages of tauopathy, suggesting that TIA1 dampens the immune response in the central nervous system during chronic stress.</p>

<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are contemporary methods to investigate the function and organization of the brain. Simultaneously acquired MEG-EEG data are inherently multi-dimensional and exhibit coupling. This study uses a coupled tensor decomposition to extract the signal sources from MEG-EEG during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). We employ the Coupled Semi-Algebraic framework for approximate CP decomposition via SImultaneous matrix diagonalization (C-SECSI). After comparing its performance with alternative methods using simulated benchmark data, we apply it to MEG-EEG recordings of 12 participants during IPS with fractions of the individual alpha frequency between 0.4 and 1.3. In the benchmark tests, C-SECSI is more accurate than SECSI and alternative methods, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, e.g., involving collinear factors or noise sources with different variances. The component field-maps allow us to separate physiologically meaningful oscillations of visually evoked brain activity from background signals. The frequency signatures of the components identify either an entrainment to the respective stimulation frequency or its first harmonic, or an oscillation in the individual alpha band or theta band. In the group analysis of both, MEG and EEG data, we observe a reciprocal relationship between alpha and theta band oscillations. The coupled tensor decomposition using C-SECSI is a robust, powerful method for the extraction of physiologically meaningful sources from multidimensional biomedical data. Unsupervised signal source extraction is an essential solution for rendering advanced multi-modal signal acquisition technology accessible to clinical diagnostics, pre-surgical planning, and brain computer interface applications.</p>

<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800 samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88% ± 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.</p>

<p>Neural entrainment is the synchronization of neural activity to the frequency of repetitive external stimuli, which can be observed as an increase in the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum at the driving frequency, -also known as the steady-state response. Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants’ individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00133">Neurodiagnostics in Sports: Investigating the Athlete’s Brain to Augment Performance and Sport-Specific Skills</a></h4>

<p>Enhancing performance levels of athletes during training and competition is a desired goal in sports. Quantifying training success is typically accompanied by performance diagnostics including the assessment of sports-relevant behavioral and physiological parameters. Even though optimal brain processing is a key factor for augmented motor performance and skill learning, neurodiagnostics is typically not implemented in performance diagnostics of athletes. We propose, that neurodiagnostics via non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will offer novel perspectives to quantify training-induced neuroplasticity and its relation to motor behavior. A better understanding of such a brain-behavior relationship during the execution of sport-specific movements might help to guide training processes and to optimize training outcomes. Furthermore, targeted non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might help to further enhance training outcomes by modulating brain areas that show training-induced neuroplasticity. However, we strongly suggest that ethical aspects in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation during training and/or competition need to be addressed before neuromodulation can be considered as a performance enhancer in sports.</p>

<p>Studies of spoken word recognition have reliably shown that both younger and older adults’ recognition of acoustically degraded words is facilitated by the presence of a linguistic context. Against this benefit, older adults’ word recognition can be differentially hampered by interference from other words that could also fit the context. These prior studies have primarily used off-line response measures such as the signal-to-noise ratio needed for a target word to be correctly identified. Less clear is the locus of these effects; whether facilitation and interference have their influence primarily during response selection, or whether their effects begin to operate even before a sentence-final target word has been uttered. This question was addressed by tracking 20 younger and 20 older adults’ eye fixations on a visually presented target word that corresponded to the final word of a contextually constraining or neutral sentence, accompanied by a second word on the computer screen that in some cases could also fit the sentence context. Growth curve analysis of the time-course of eye-gaze on a target word showed facilitation and inhibition effects begin to appear even as a spoken sentence is unfolding in time. Consistent with an age-related inhibition deficit, older adults’ word recognition was slowed by the presence of a semantic competitor to a degree not observed for younger adults, with this effect operating early in the recognition process.</p>

<p>Afferent feedback can appreciably alter the pharyngeal phase of swallow. In order to measure the stability of the swallow motor pattern during several types of alterations in afferent feedback, we assessed swallow during a conventional water challenge in four anesthetized cats, and compared that to swallows induced by fixed (20 Hz) and stochastic (1-20Hz) electrical stimulation applied to the superior laryngeal nerve. The swallow motor patterns were evaluated by electromyographic activity (EMG) of eight muscles, based on their functional significance: laryngeal elevators (mylohyoid, geniohyoid, and thyrohyoid); laryngeal adductor (thyroarytenoid); inferior pharyngeal constrictor (thyropharyngeus); upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus); and inspiratory activity (parasternal and costal diaphragm). Both the fixed and stochastic electrical stimulation paradigms increased activity of the laryngeal elevators, produced short-term facilitation evidenced by increasing swallow durations over the stimulus period, and conversely inhibited swallow-related diaphragm activity. Both the fixed and stochastic stimulus conditions also increased specific EMG amplitudes, which never occurred with the water challenges. Stochastic stimulation increased swallow excitability, as measured by an increase in the number of swallows produced. Consistent with our previous results, changes in the swallow motor pattern for pairs of muscles were only sometimes correlated with each other. We conclude that alterations in afferent feedback produced particular variations of the swallow motor pattern. We hypothesize that specific SLN feedback might modulate the swallow central pattern generator during aberrant feeding conditions (food/liquid entering the airway), which may protect the airway and serve as potentially important clinical diagnostic indicators.</p>

<p>The assessment of the consciousness level of Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) patients often depends on a subjective interpretation of the observed spontaneous and volitional behavior. To date, the misdiagnosis level is around 30%. The aim of this study was to observe the behavior of UWS patients, during the administration of noxious stimulation by a Trace Conditioning protocol, assessed by the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) entropy. We recruited 13 Healthy Control (HC) and 30 UWS patients at 31 ± 9 days from the acute event evaluated by Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R) and Nociception Coma Scale (NCS). Two different stimuli [musical stimulus (MUS) and nociceptive stimulus (NOC)], preceded, respectively by two different tones, were administered following the sequences (A) MUS1 – NOC1 – MUS2 – MUS3 – NOC2 – MUS4 – NOC3 – NOC<sup>*</sup>, and (B) MUS1<sup>*</sup>, NOC1<sup>*</sup>, NOC2<sup>*</sup>, MUS2<sup>*</sup>, NOC3<sup>*</sup>, MUS3<sup>*</sup>, NOC4<sup>*</sup>, MUS4<sup>*</sup>. All the (<sup>*</sup>) indicate the only tones administration. CRS-R and NCS assessments were repeated for three consecutive weeks. MUS4, NOC3, and NOC<sup>*</sup> were compared for GSR wave peak magnitude, time to reach the peak, and time of wave's decay by Wilcoxon's test to assess the Conditioned Response (CR). The Sample Entropy (SampEn) was recorded in baseline and both sequences. Machine Learning approach was used to identify a rule to discriminate the CR. The GSR magnitude of CR was higher comparing music stimulus (p &lt; 0.0001) and CR extinction (p &lt; 0.002) in nine patients and in HC. Patients with CR showed a higher SampEn in sequence A compared to patients without CR. Within the third and fourth weeks from protocol administration, eight of the nine patients (88.9%) evolved into MCS. The Machine-learning showed a high performance to differentiate presence/absence of CR (≥95%). The possibility to observe the CR to the noxious stimulus, by means of the GSR and SampEn, can represent a potential method to reduce the misdiagnosis in UWS patients.</p>

<p>Background: Pain and body perception are essentially two subjective mutually influencing experiences. However, in the field of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases we lack of a comprehensive knowledge about the relationship between body perception dysfunctions and pain or disability. We systematically mapped the literature published about the topics of: (a) somatoperception; (b) body ownership; and (c) perception of space, analysing the relationship with pain and disability. The results were organized around the two main topics of the assessment and treatment of perceptual dysfunctions.</p><p>Methods: This scoping review followed the six-stage methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. Ten electronic databases and grey literature were systematically searched. The PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews was used for reporting results. Two reviewers with different background, independently performed study screening and selection, and one author performed data extraction, that was checked by a second reviewer.</p><p>Results: Thirty-seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The majority of studies (68%) concerned the assessment methodology, and the remaining 32% investigated the effects of therapeutic interventions. Research designs, methodologies adopted, and settings varied considerably across studies. Evidence of distorted body experience were found mainly for explicit somatoperception, especially in studies adopting self-administered questionnaire and subjective measures, highlighting in some cases the presence of sub-groups with different perceptual features. Almost half of the intervention studies (42%) provided therapeutic approaches combining more than one perceptual task, or sensory-motor tasks together with perceptual strategies, thus it was difficult to estimate the relative effectiveness of each single therapeutic component.</p><p>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically map and summarize this research area in the field of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases. Although methodological limitations limit the validity of the evidence obtained, some strategies of assessment tested and therapeutic strategies proposed represent useful starting points for future research. This review highlights preliminary evidence, strengths, and limitations of the literature published about the research questions, identifying key points that remain opened to be addressed, and make suggestions for future research studies. Body representation, as well as pain perception and treatment, can be better understood if an enlarged perspective including body and space perception is considered.</p>

<p>Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to be an inexpensive, safe, and effective way of augmenting a variety of cognitive abilities. Relatively recent advances in neuroimaging technology have provided the ability to measure brain activity concurrently during active brain stimulation rather than after stimulation. The effects on brain activity elicited by tDCS during active tDCS reported by initial studies have been somewhat conflicted and seemingly dependent on whether a behavioral improvement was observed.</p><p>Objective: The current study set out to address questions regarding behavioral change, within and between-participant designs as well as differentiating the effects on hemodynamic amplitude and baseline during active tDCS stimulation.</p><p>Methods: We tested the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on anterior hemodynamics in prefrontal cortex during performance on a spatial memory task. Prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a wearable and portable neuroimaging technique that utilizes near infrared light to measure cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes non-invasively. There were two groups, one group (n = 10) received only sham stimulation and the other group (n = 11) received sham followed by anodal stimulation to right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Results: Analyses revealed an increase in spatial memory performance following tDCS stimulation. This augmented performance was accompanied by changes to oxygenation (HbO–HbR) at the onset of the hemodynamic response in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left ventral medial prefrontal cortex. In these regions we also observed that stimulation improved neural processing efficiency, by reducing oxygenation and increasing performance from block to block. During and following tDCS stimulation, it was also observed that in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the relationship between performance and oxygenation inverted, from a negative relationship to a positive relationship.</p><p>Conclusion: The results suggest that tDCS is predominately a mechanism for changing neurons propensity for activity as opposed to their strength of activity. tDCS not only alters the efficiency of task relevant processing, but also the nature in which hemodynamic resources are used during augmented task performance.</p>

<p>Biological realism of dendritic morphologies is important for simulating electrical stimulation of brain tissue. By adding point process modeling and conditional sampling to existing generation strategies, we provide a novel means of reproducing the nuanced branching behavior that occurs in different layers of granule cell dendritic morphologies. In this study, a heterogeneous Poisson point process was used to simulate branching events. Conditional distributions were then used to select branch angles depending on the orthogonal distance to the somatic plane. The proposed method was compared to an existing generation tool and a control version of the proposed method that used a homogeneous Poisson point process. Morphologies were generated with each method and then compared to a set of digitally reconstructed neurons. The introduction of a conditionally dependent branching rate resulted in the generation of morphologies that more accurately reproduced the emergent properties of dendritic material per layer, Sholl intersections, and proximal passive current flow. Conditional dependence was critically important for the generation of realistic granule cell dendritic morphologies.</p>

<p>Many epidemiology studies have shown that maternal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) results in a greater risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) development, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism and provide a possible treatment for PCOS-mediated ASD through three experiments: Experiment 1: real-time PCR and western blots were employed to measure gene expression in human neurons, and the luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to map the responsive elements on related gene promoters. Experiment 2: pregnant dams were prenatally exposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androgen receptor (AR) knockdown (shAR) in the amygdala, or berberine (BBR), and the subsequent male offspring were used for autism-like behavior (ALB) assay followed by biomedical analysis, including gene expression, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Experiment 3: the male offspring from prenatal DHT exposed dams were postnatally treated by either shAR or BBR, and the offspring were used for ALB assay followed by biomedical analysis. Our findings showed that DHT treatment suppresses the expression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) through AR-mediated hypermethylation on the ERβ promoter, and BBR treatment suppresses AR expression through hypermethylation on the AR promoter. Prenatal DHT treatment induces ERβ suppression, oxidative stress and mitochondria dysfunction in the amygdala with subsequent ALB behavior in male offspring, and AR knockdown partly diminishes this effect. Furthermore, both prenatal and postnatal treatment of BBR partly restores prenatal DHT exposure-mediated ALB. In conclusion, DHT suppresses ERβ expression through the AR signaling pathway by hypermethylation on the ERβ promoter, and BBR restores this effect through AR suppression. Prenatal DHT exposure induces ALB in offspring through AR-mediated ERβ suppression, and both prenatal and postnatal treatment of BBR ameliorates this effect. We conclude that BBR ameliorates prenatal DHT exposure-induced ALB through AR suppression, this study may help elucidate the potential mechanism and identify a potential treatment through using BBR for PCOS-mediated ASD.</p>

<p>The intrinsic nervous system of the gut interacts with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) via bidirectional neuroimmune interactions. The caecum is an understudied region of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that houses a large supply of microbes and is involved in generating immune responses. The caecal patch is a lymphoid aggregate located within the caecum that regulates microbial content and immune responses. People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) experience serious GI dysfunction, including inflammatory disorders, more frequently than the general population. Autism is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder defined by the presence of repetitive behavior or restricted interests, language impairment, and social deficits. Mutations in genes encoding synaptic adhesion proteins such as the R451C missense mutation in neuroligin-3 (NL3) are associated with autism and impair synaptic transmission. We previously reported that NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice, a well-established model of autism, have altered enteric neurons and GI dysfunction; however, whether the autism-associated R451C mutation alters the caecal enteric nervous system and immune function is unknown. We assessed for gross anatomical changes in the caecum and quantified the proportions of caecal submucosal and myenteric neurons in wild-type and NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice using immunofluorescence. In the caecal patch, we assessed total cellular density as well as the density and morphology of Iba-1 labeled macrophages to identify whether the R451C mutation affects neuro-immune interactions. NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice have significantly reduced caecal weight compared to wild-type mice, irrespective of background strain. Caecal weight is also reduced in mice lacking Neuroligin-3. NL3<sup>R451C</sup> caecal ganglia contain more neurons overall and increased numbers of Nitric Oxide (NO) producing neurons (labeled by Nitric Oxide Synthase; NOS) per ganglion in both the submucosal and myenteric plexus. Overall caecal patch cell density was unchanged however NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice have an increased density of Iba-1 labeled enteric macrophages. Macrophages in NL3<sup>R451C</sup> were smaller and more spherical in morphology.

These findings provide further insights into the potential modulation of neural and immune pathways.</p>

<p>Brain microvasculature forms a specialized structure, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to maintain homeostasis and integrity of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB dysfunction is emerging as a critical contributor to multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, autoimmune multiple sclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. The brain microvasculature exhibits highly cellular and regional heterogeneity to accommodate dynamic changes of microenvironment during homeostasis and diseases. Thus, investigating the underlying mechanisms that contribute to molecular or cellular changes of the BBB is a significant challenge. Here, we describe an optimized protocol to purify microvessels from the mouse cerebral cortex using mechanical homogenization and density-gradient centrifugation, while maintaining the structural integrity and functional activity of the BBB. We show that the isolated microvessel fragments consist of BBB cell populations, including endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, pericytes, as well as tight junction proteins that seal endothelial cells. Furthermore, we describe the procedures to generate single-cell suspensions from isolated microvessel fragments. We demonstrate that cells in the single-cell suspensions are highly viable and suitable for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. This protocol does not require transgenic mice and cell sorting equipment to isolate fluorescence-labeled endothelial cells. The optimized procedures can be applied to different disease models to generate viable cells for single-cell analysis to uncover transcriptional or epigenetic landscapes of BBB component cells.</p>

<p>Astrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative proteinopathies as influencing neuronal degeneration or neuroprotection, and also act as potential mediators of the propagation or elimination of disease-associated proteins. Protein astrogliopathies can be observed in different forms of neurodegenerative conditions. Morphological characterization of astrogliopathy is used only for the classification of tauopathies. Currently, at least six types of astrocytic tau pathologies are distinguished. Astrocytic plaques (AP), tufted astrocytes (TAs), ramified astrocytes (RA), and globular astroglial inclusions are seen predominantly in primary tauopathies, while thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSA) and granular/fuzzy astrocytes (GFA) are evaluated in aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG). ARTAG can be seen in the white and gray matter and subpial, subependymal, and perivascular locations. Some of these overlap with the features of tau pathology seen in Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Furthermore, gray matter ARTAG shares features with primary tauopathy-related astrocytic tau pathology. Sequential distribution patterns have been described for tau astrogliopathies. Importantly, astrocytic tau pathology in primary tauopathies can be observed in brain areas without neuronal tau deposition. The various morphologies of tau astrogliopathy might reflect a role in the propagation of pathological tau protein, an early response to a yet unidentified neurodegeneration-inducing event, or, particularly for ARTAG, a response to a repeated or prolonged pathogenic process such as blood-brain barrier dysfunction or local mechanical impact. The concept of tau astrogliopathies and ARTAG facilitated communication among research disciplines and triggered the investigation of the significance of astrocytic lesions in neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

<p>Aging, even in the absence of clear pathology of dementia, is associated with cognitive decline. Neuroimaging, especially diffusion-weighted imaging, has been highly valuable in understanding some of these changes in live humans, non-invasively. Traditional tensor techniques have revealed that the integrity of the fornix and other white matter tracts significantly deteriorates with age, and that this deterioration is highly correlated with worsening cognitive performance. However, traditional tensor techniques are still not specific enough to indict explicit microstructural features that may be responsible for age-related cognitive decline and cannot be used to effectively study gray matter properties. Here, we sought to determine whether recent advances in diffusion-weighted imaging, including Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution, would provide more sensitive measures of age-related changes in the microstructure of the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated these measures in a group of young (ages 20–38 years old) and older (ages 59–84 years old) adults and assessed their relationships with performance on tests of cognition. We found that the fiber density (FD) of the fornix and the neurite density index (NDI) of the fornix, hippocampal subfields (DG/CA3, CA1, and subiculum), and parahippocampal cortex, varied as a function of age in a cross-sectional cohort. Moreover, in the fornix, DG/CA3, and CA1, these changes correlated with memory performance on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), even after regressing out the effect of age, suggesting that they were capturing neurobiological properties directly related to performance in this task. These measures provide more details regarding age-related neurobiological properties. For example, a change in fiber density could mean a reduction in axonal packing density or myelination, and the increase in NDI observed might be explained by changes in dendritic complexity or even sprouting. These results provide a far more comprehensive view than previously determined on the possible system-wide processes that may be occurring because of healthy aging and demonstrate that advanced diffusion-weighted imaging is evolving into a powerful tool to study more than just white matter properties.</p>

<p>In the inner ear, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling has been described as facilitating otoprotection, which was previously observed through elevated cGMP levels achieved by phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition. However, to date, the upstream guanylyl cyclase (GC) subtype eliciting cGMP production is unknown. Here, we show that mice with a genetic disruption of the gene encoding the cGMP generator GC-A, the receptor for atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides, display a greater vulnerability of hair cells to hidden hearing loss and noise- and age-dependent hearing loss. This vulnerability was associated with GC-A expression in spiral ganglia and outer hair cells (OHCs) but not in inner hair cells (IHCs). GC-A knockout mice exhibited elevated hearing thresholds, most pronounced for the detection of high-frequency tones. Deficits in OHC input–output functions in high-frequency regions were already present in young GC-A-deficient mice, with no signs of an accelerated progression of age-related hearing loss or higher vulnerability to acoustic trauma. OHCs in these frequency regions in young GC-A knockout mice exhibited diminished levels of KCNQ4 expression, which is the dominant K<sup>+</sup> channel in OHCs, and decreased activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, an enzyme involved in DNA repair. Further, GC-A knockout mice had IHC synapse impairments and reduced amplitudes of auditory brainstem responses that progressed with age and with acoustic trauma, in contrast to OHCs, when compared to GC-A wild-type littermates. We conclude that GC-A/cGMP-dependent signaling pathways have otoprotective functions and GC-A gene disruption differentially contributes to hair-cell damage in a healthy, aged, or injured system. Thus, augmentation of natriuretic peptide GC-A signaling likely has potential to overcome hidden and noise-induced hearing loss, as well as presbycusis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55370">CNGA3 acts as a cold sensor in hypothalamic neurons</a></h4>

Most mammals maintain their body temperature around 37°C, whereas in hibernators it can approach 0°C without triggering a thermogenic response. The remarkable plasticity of the thermoregulatory system allowed mammals to thrive in variable environmental conditions and occupy a wide range of geographical habitats, but the molecular basis of thermoregulation remains poorly understood. Here we leverage the thermoregulatory differences between mice and hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) to investigate the mechanism of cold sensitivity in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus, a critical thermoregulatory region. We report that, in comparison to squirrels, mice have a larger proportion of cold-sensitive neurons in the POA. We further show that mouse cold-sensitive neurons express the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel CNGA3, and that mouse, but not squirrel, CNGA3 is potentiated by cold. Our data reveal CNGA3 as a hypothalamic cold sensor and a molecular marker to interrogate the neuronal circuitry underlying thermoregulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55211">Cooperative enzymatic control of N-acyl amino acids by PM20D1 and FAAH</a></h4>

The N-acyl amino acids are a family of bioactive lipids with pleiotropic physiologic functions, including in energy homeostasis. Their endogenous levels are regulated by an extracellular mammalian N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase called PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1). Using an activity-guided biochemical approach, we report the molecular identification of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) as a second intracellular N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase. In vitro, FAAH exhibits a more restricted substrate scope compared to PM20D1. In mice, genetic ablation or selective pharmacological inhibition of FAAH bidirectionally dysregulates intracellular, but not circulating, N-acyl amino acids. Dual blockade of both PM20D1 and FAAH reveals a dramatic and non-additive biochemical engagement of these two enzymatic pathways. These data establish FAAH as a second intracellular pathway for N-acyl amino acid metabolism and underscore enzymatic division of labor as an enabling strategy for the regulation of a structurally diverse bioactive lipid family.

The Norway rat has important impacts on our life. They are amongst the most used research subjects, resulting in ground-breaking advances. At the same time, wild rats live in close association with us, leading to various adverse interactions. In face of this relevance, it is surprising how little is known about their natural behaviour. While recent laboratory studies revealed their complex social skills, little is known about their social behaviour in the wild. An integration of these different scientific approaches is crucial to understand their social life, which will enable us to design more valid research paradigms, develop more effective management strategies, and to provide better welfare standards. Hence, I first summarise the literature on their natural social behaviour. Second, I provide an overview of recent developments concerning their social cognition. Third, I illustrate why an integration of these areas would be beneficial to optimise our interactions with them.

Phosphate overload contributes to mineral bone disorders that are associated with crystal nephropathies. Phytate, the major form of phosphorus in plant seeds, is known as an indigestible and of negligible nutritional value in humans. However, the mechanism and adverse effects of high-phytate intake on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate absorption and homeostasis are unknown. Here, we show that excessive intake of phytate along with a low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet fed to rats contributed to the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss through tubular dysfunction secondary to dysregulation of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplementation alleviated the detrimental effects of excess dietary phytate on bone and kidney through excretion of undigested Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate, which prevented a vicious cycle of intestinal phosphate overload and renal phosphate wasting while improving intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> bioavailability. Thus, we demonstrate that phytate is digestible without a high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet and is a risk factor for phosphate overloading and for the development of crystal nephropathies and bone disease.

The melanoma-associated antigen family A (MAGEA) antigens are expressed in a wide variety of malignant tumors but not in adult somatic cells, rendering them attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that a number of cancer-associated MAGEA mutants that undergo proteasome-dependent degradation <i>in vitro</i> could negatively impact their utility as immunotherapeutic targets. Importantly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell models, MAGEA6 suppresses macroautophagy (autophagy). The inhibition of autophagy is released upon MAGEA6 degradation, which can be induced by nutrient deficiency or by acquisition of cancer-associated mutations. Using xenograft mouse models, we demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy is critical for tumor initiation whereas reinstitution of autophagy as a consequence of MAGEA6 degradation contributes to tumor progression. These findings could inform cancer immunotherapeutic strategies for targeting MAGEA antigens and provide mechanistic insight into the divergent roles of <i>MAGEA6</i> during pancreatic cancer initiation and progression.

<p>by Lara S. Burchardt, Mirjam Knörnschild</p>

Analyzing the rhythm of animals’ acoustic signals is of interest to a growing number of researchers: evolutionary biologists want to disentangle how these structures evolved and what patterns can be found, and ecologists and conservation biologists aim to discriminate cryptic species on the basis of parameters of acoustic signals such as temporal structures. Temporal structures are also relevant for research on vocal production learning, a part of which is for the animal to learn a temporal structure. These structures, in other words, these rhythms, are the topic of this paper. How can they be investigated in a meaningful, comparable and universal way? Several approaches exist. Here we used five methods to compare their suitability and interpretability for different questions and datasets and test how they support the reproducibility of results and bypass biases. Three very different datasets with regards to recording situation, length and context were analyzed: two social vocalizations of Neotropical bats (multisyllabic, medium long isolation calls of <i>Saccopteryx bilineata</i>, and monosyllabic, very short isolation calls of <i>Carollia perspicillata)</i> and click trains of sperm whales, <i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>. Techniques to be compared included Fourier analysis with a newly developed goodness-of-fit value, a generate-and-test approach where data was overlaid with varying artificial beats, and the analysis of inter-onset-intervals and calculations of a normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and we also show suggestions on how to best visualize rhythm analysis results. Furthermore, we developed a decision tree that will enable researchers to select a suitable and comparable method on the basis of their data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T27mpkMvTu4" width="1" />

<p>by Qili Fei, Zhongyu Zou, Ian A. Roundtree, Hui-Lung Sun, Chuan He</p>

The <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification regulates mRNA stability and translation. Here, we show that transcriptomic m<sup>6</sup>A modification can be dynamic and the m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein YTH <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) promotes mRNA decay during cell cycle. Depletion of YTHDF2 in HeLa cells leads to the delay of mitotic entry due to overaccumulation of negative regulators of cell cycle such as Wee1-like protein kinase (WEE1). We demonstrate that WEE1 transcripts contain m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which promotes their decay through YTHDF2. Moreover, we found that YTHDF2 protein stability is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity. Thus, CDK1, YTHDF2, and WEE1 form a feedforward regulatory loop to promote mitotic entry. We further identified Cullin 1 (CUL1), Cullin 4A (CUL4A), damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1), and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that mediate YTHDF2 proteolysis. Our study provides insights into how cell cycle mediators modulate transcriptomic m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which in turn regulates the cell cycle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IIrJs4b23Q8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Here we systematically tested the hypothesis that motivated behavioral responsiveness to preferred and avoided taste compounds is relatively independent of the olfactory system in mice whose olfactory bulbs (main and accessory) were surgically disconnected from the rest of the brain [bulbotomy (BULBx)]. BULBx was confirmed histologically as well as functionally with the buried food test. In brief access taste tests, animals received 10-s trials of various concentrations of a taste compound delivered quasirandomly. BULBx C57BL/6 (B6) mice displayed severely blunted concentration-dependent licking for the disaccharide sucrose, the maltodextrin Maltrin, and the fat emulsion Intralipid relative to their sham-operated controls (SHAM B6). Licking for the noncaloric sweetener saccharin was also blunted by bulbotomy, but less so. As expected, mice lacking a functional "sweet" receptor [T1R2+T1R3 knockout (KO)] displayed concentration-dependent responsiveness to Maltrin and severely attenuated licking to sucrose. Like in B6 mice, responsiveness to both stimuli was exceptionally curtailed by bulbotomy. In contrast to these deficits in taste-guided behavior for unconditionally preferred stimuli, BULBx in B6 and KO mice did not alter concentration-dependent decreases for the representative avoided stimuli quinine and citric acid. Nor did it temper the intake of and preference for high concentrations of affectively positive stimuli when presented in long-term (23-h) two-bottle tests, demonstrating that the surgery does not lead to a generalized motivational deficit. Collectively, these behavioral results demonstrate that specific aspects of taste-guided ingestive motivation are profoundly disturbed by eliminating the anatomic connections between the main/accessory olfactory bulbs and the rest of the brain.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess real‐world effectiveness of initial treatment with newer compared to injectable disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) on disease activity in pediatric MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a cohort study of children with MS/CIS followed at 12 clinics in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers, who received initial therapy with newer (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab) or injectable (interferon‐β, glatiramer acetate) DMTs. Propensity scores (PS) were computed including pre‐identified confounders. Relapse rate while on initial DMT was modeled with negative binomial regression, adjusted for PS‐quintile. Time to new/enlarging T2 hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions on MRI brain were modeled with midpoint survival analyses, adjusted for PS‐quintile.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>741 children began therapy before 18 years, 197 with newer and 544 with injectable DMTs. Those started on newer DMTs were older (15.2 vs. injectable 14.4 years, p=0.001) and less likely to have a monofocal presentation. In PS‐quintile adjusted analysis, those on newer DMTs had lower relapse rate than those on injectables (rate ratio 0.45, 95%CI 0.29‐0.70, p&lt;0.001; rate difference 0.27, 0.14‐0.40, p=0.004). One would need to treat with newer over injectable DMTs for 3.7 person‐years to prevent one relapse. Those started on newer DMTs had lower rate of new/enlarging T2 (HR 0.51, 0.36‐0.72, p&lt;0.001) and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions (HR 0.38, 0.23‐0.63, p&lt;0.001) than those on injectables.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Initial treatment of pediatric MS/CIS with newer DMTs led to better disease activity control compared to injectables, supporting greater effectiveness of newer therapies. Long‐term safety data for newer DMTs are required.</p>

<p>Transcription factors regulate multiple processes during brain development and in the adult brain, from brain patterning to differentiation and maturation of highly specialized neurons as well as establishing and maintaining the functional neuronal connectivity. The members of the zinc-finger transcription factor family Bcl11 are mainly expressed in the hematopoietic and central nervous systems regulating the expression of numerous genes involved in a wide range of pathways. In the brain Bcl11 proteins are required to regulate progenitor cell proliferation as well as differentiation, migration, and functional integration of neural cells. Mutations of the human Bcl11 genes lead to anomalies in multiple systems including neurodevelopmental impairments like intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders.</p>

<p>Automatic segmentation of brain tumors has the potential to enable volumetric measures and high-throughput analysis in the clinical setting. Reaching this potential seems almost achieved, considering the steady increase in segmentation accuracy. However, despite segmentation accuracy, the current methods still do not meet the robustness levels required for patient-centered clinical use. In this regard, uncertainty estimates are a promising direction to improve the robustness of automated segmentation systems. Different uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed, but little is known about their usefulness and limitations for brain tumor segmentation. In this study, we present an analysis of the most commonly used uncertainty estimation methods in regards to benefits and challenges for brain tumor segmentation. We evaluated their quality in terms of calibration, segmentation error localization, and segmentation failure detection. Our results show that the uncertainty methods are typically well-calibrated when evaluated at the dataset level. Evaluated at the subject level, we found notable miscalibrations and limited segmentation error localization (e.g., for correcting segmentations), which hinder the direct use of the voxel-wise uncertainties. Nevertheless, voxel-wise uncertainty showed value to detect failed segmentations when uncertainty estimates are aggregated at the subject level. Therefore, we suggest a careful usage of voxel-wise uncertainty measures and highlight the importance of developing solutions that address the subject-level requirements on calibration and segmentation error localization.</p>

Background<p>Surgery is a key approach for achieving seizure freedom in children with focal onset epilepsy. However, the resection can affect or be in the vicinity of the optic radiations. Multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography can better characterize tissue structure and provide guidance to help minimize surgical related deficits. Whilst in adults tractography has been used to demonstrate that damage to the optic radiations leads to postoperative visual field deficits, this approach has yet to be properly explored in children.</p>Objective<p>To demonstrate the capabilities of multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography in characterizing microstructural changes in children with epilepsy pre- and post-surgery affecting the occipital, parietal or temporal lobes.</p>Methods<p>Diffusion Tensor Imaging and the Spherical Mean Technique were used to investigate the microstructure of the optic radiations. Furthermore, tractography was used to evaluate whether pre-surgical reconstructions of the optic radiations overlap with the resection margin as measured using anatomical post-surgical T1-weighted MRI.</p>Results<p>Increased diffusivity in patients compared to controls at baseline was observed with evidence of decreased diffusivity, anisotropy, and neurite orientation distribution in contralateral hemisphere after surgery. Pre-surgical optic radiation tractography overlapped with post-surgical resection margins in 20/43 (46%) children, and where visual data was available before and after surgery, the presence of overlap indicated a visual field deficit.</p>Conclusion<p>This is the first report in a pediatric series which highlights the relevance of tractography for future pre-surgical evaluation in children undergoing epilepsy surgery and the usefulness of multi-shell diffusion MRI to characterize brain microstructure in these patients.</p>

<p>Aging is a condition that may be characterized by a decline in physical, sensory, and mental capacities, while increased morbidity and multimorbidity may be associated with disability. A wide range of clinical conditions (e.g., frailty, mild cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome) and age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cancer, sarcopenia, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases) affect older people. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel and promising tool for assessment and rehabilitation in older people. Usability is a crucial factor that must be considered when designing virtual systems for medicine. We conducted a systematic review with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines concerning the usability of VR clinical systems in aging and provided suggestions to structure usability piloting. Findings show that different populations of older people have been recruited to mainly assess usability of non-immersive VR, with particular attention paid to motor/physical rehabilitation. Mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative tools together) is the preferred methodology; technology acceptance models are the most applied theoretical frameworks, however senior adapted models are the best within this context. Despite minor interaction issues and bugs, virtual systems are rated as usable and feasible. We encourage usability and user experience pilot studies to ameliorate interaction and improve acceptance and use of VR clinical applications in older people with the aid of suggestions (VR-USOP) provided by our analysis.</p>

<p>The positive relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive performance is mediated, in part, by differences in brain structure in typically developing youth. Associations between brain regions that relate to SES overlap with brain regions known to be sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Animal models demonstrate that PAE attenuates neural and cognitive benefits of early life enrichment. However, whether or not environmental factors related to SES are associated with brain development in youth affected by PAE remains unknown in humans.</p>Methods<p>T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in participants with PAE and compared to age- and sex- matched Controls (n = 197, 48% with PAE, 44% girls, 6.5–17.7 years old). General linear modeling was utilized to examine associations between SES and subcortical brain volumes for youth with PAE compared to Controls.</p>Results<p>Group by SES interactions were observed within the hippocampus (HPC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral diencephalon (vDC) (corrected p values &lt;0.05), where positive associations (e.g., higher SES related to larger subcortical volumes) were observed within Controls, but not youth with PAE. Post hoc analyses examined associations between SES and brain volumes within each group independently, and revealed widespread positive associations among Controls (Amyg, HPC, NAc, Pallidum, Putamen, vDC), but not youth with PAE. Across both groups, larger subcortical volumes were related to higher cognitive performance.</p>Conclusion<p>Typically developing youth exhibit increased subcortical volumes with increased SES, and surprisingly, this relationship is absent in adolescents with PAE. Findings suggest that subcortical brain volumes are neurocognitively relevant in both groups. The present results expand our understanding of the impact of PAE on the developing human brain within varying environmental contexts, and may inform novel environmental interventions that aim to improve, in part, on-going disruptions in brain development among youth with PAE. Our study highlights novel complexities in the pursuit to understand SES-brain associations, as we provide evidence that SES matters for brain outcomes among typically developing youth, and possibly not as much on an already altered brain as a result of PAE.</p>

<p>Accurate segmentation of different sub-regions of gliomas such as peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing, and non-enhancing tumor core from multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape of these tumors, segmentation of the sub-regions is challenging. Recent developments using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in various semantic and medical image segmentation tasks, many of which are based on the U-Net network structure with symmetric encoding and decoding paths for end-to-end segmentation due to its high efficiency and good performance. In brain tumor segmentation, the 3D nature of multimodal MRI poses challenges such as memory and computation limitations and class imbalance when directly adopting the U-Net structure. In this study we aim to develop a deep learning model using a 3D U-Net with adaptations in the training and testing strategies, network structures, and model parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Furthermore, instead of picking one best model, an ensemble of multiple models trained with different hyper-parameters are used to reduce random errors from each model and yield improved performance. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and achieved the 9th place in the very competitive 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. In addition, to emphasize the clinical value of the developed segmentation method, a linear model based on the radiomics features extracted from segmentation and other clinical features are developed to predict patient overall survival. Evaluation of these innovations shows high prediction accuracy in both low-grade glioma and glioblastoma patients, which achieved the 1st place in the 2018 BraTS challenge.</p>

<p>Treatment for peripheral nerve injury remains limited. The inherent differences between motor and sensory nerve fibers in peripheral nerves should be considered to improve the effects of clinical treatment of peripheral nerve injury. In this study, we investigated the differences in protein expression and ultrastructure between the cutaneous and muscular branches of the femoral nerve in rats. Our results suggest that the cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve mainly contains sensory nerve fibers and few motor nerve fibers; Correspondingly, many motor nerve fibers and few sensory nerve fibers were observed in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve, which indicate that two branches of femoral nerve are mixed nerve. The mean thickness of the myelin sheath and basement membrane of the medullated fibers in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve was greater than that of the cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve. However, the cutaneous branch has a larger G-ratio. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the cellular component term extracellular space was the most highly enriched, and more genes were upregulated in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve. Meanwhile, the expression of key proteins were validated by Western Blot, and immunofluorescence targets the expression of key proteins, which is consistent with the enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology. In conclusion, inherent differences in protein expression and ultrastructure were observed between the cutaneous and muscular branches of the femoral nerve in rats, which should be considered in future studies on the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries.</p>

<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized as a transitional phase between cognitive decline associated with normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measuring blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals provides complementary information considered essential for understanding disease progression. Previous studies suggested that multi-scale entropy (MSE) analysis quantifying the complexity of BOLD signals is a novel and promising method for investigating neurodegeneration associated with cognitive decline in different stages of MCI. Therefore, the current study used MSE to explore the changes in the complexity of resting-state brain BOLD signals in patients with early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI). We recruited 345 participants’ data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including 176 normal control (NC) subjects, 87 patients with EMCI and 82 patients with LMCI. We observed a significant reduction of brain signal complexity toward regularity in the left fusiform gyrus region in the EMCI group and in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the LMCI group. Our results extend prior work by revealing that significant reductions of brain BOLD signal complexity can be detected in different stages of MCI independent of age, sex and regional atrophy. Notably, the reduction of BOLD signal complexity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was significantly associated with greater risk of progression to AD. The present study thus identified MSE as a potential imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease and provides further insights into the neuropathology of cognitive decline in prodromal AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53934">Single-molecule functional anatomy of endogenous HER2-HER3 heterodimers</a></h4>

Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs) are the primary targets of many directed cancer therapies. However, the reason a specific dimer of HERs generates a stronger proliferative signal than other permutations remains unclear. Here, we used single-molecule immunoprecipitation to develop a biochemical assay for endogenously-formed, entire HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We observed unexpected, large conformational fluctuations in juxta-membrane and kinase domains of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. Nevertheless, the individual HER2-HER3 heterodimers catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation at an unusually high rate, while simultaneously interacting with multiple copies of downstream signaling effectors. Our results suggest that the high catalytic rate and multi-tasking capability make a concerted contribution to the strong signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53683">Structural basis for ion selectivity in TMEM175 K<sup>+</sup> channels</a></h4>

The TMEM175 family constitutes recently discovered K<sup>+</sup> channels that are important for autophagosome turnover and lysosomal pH regulation and are associated with the early onset of Parkinson Disease. TMEM175 channels lack a P-loop selectivity filter, a hallmark of all known K<sup>+</sup> channels, raising the question how selectivity is achieved. Here, we report the X-ray structure of a closed bacterial TMEM175 channel in complex with a nanobody fusion-protein disclosing bound K<sup>+</sup> ions. Our analysis revealed that a highly conserved layer of threonine residues in the pore conveys a basal K<sup>+ </sup>selectivity. An additional layer comprising two serines in human TMEM175 increases selectivity further and renders this channel sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Our findings suggest that large hydrophobic side chains occlude the pore, forming a physical gate, and that channel opening by iris-like motions simultaneously relocates the gate and exposes the otherwise concealed selectivity filter to the pore lumen.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53357">Top-down machine learning approach for high-throughput single-molecule analysis</a></h4>

Single-molecule approaches provide enormous insight into the dynamics of biomolecules, but adequately sampling distributions of states and events often requires extensive sampling. Although emerging experimental techniques can generate such large datasets, existing analysis tools are not suitable to process the large volume of data obtained in high-throughput paradigms. Here, we present a new analysis platform (DISC) that accelerates unsupervised analysis of single-molecule trajectories. By merging model-free statistical learning with the Viterbi algorithm, DISC idealizes single-molecule trajectories up to three orders of magnitude faster with improved accuracy compared to other commonly used algorithms. Further, we demonstrate the utility of DISC algorithm to probe cooperativity between multiple binding events in the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of HCN pacemaker channel. Given the flexible and efficient nature of DISC, we anticipate it will be a powerful tool for unsupervised processing of high-throughput data across a range of single-molecule experiments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51787">Direct ETTIN-auxin interaction controls chromatin states in gynoecium development</a></h4>

Hormonal signalling in animals often involves direct transcription factor-hormone interactions that modulate gene expression<sup>1,2</sup>. In contrast, plant hormone signalling is most commonly based on de-repression via the degradation of transcriptional repressors<sup>3-5</sup>. Recently, we uncovered a non-canonical signalling mechanism for the plant hormone auxin whereby auxin directly affects the activity of the atypical auxin response factor (ARF), ETTIN towards target genes without the requirement for protein degradation<sup>6,7</sup>. Here we show that ETTIN directly binds auxin, leading to dissociation from co-repressor proteins of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED family followed by histone acetylation and induction of gene expression. This mechanism is reminiscent of animal hormone signalling as it affects the activity towards regulation of target genes and provides the first example of a DNA-bound hormone receptor in plants. Whilst auxin affects canonical ARFs indirectly by facilitating degradation of Aux/IAA repressors, direct ETTIN-auxin interactions allow switching between repressive and de-repressive chromatin states in an instantly-reversible manner.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51772">The axonal actin-spectrin lattice acts as a tension buffering shock absorber</a></h4>

Axons span extreme distances and are subjected to significant stretch deformations during limb movements or sudden head movements, especially during impacts. Yet, axon biomechanics, and its relation to the ultrastructure that allows axons to withstand mechanical stress, is poorly understood. Using a custom developed force apparatus, we demonstrate that chick dorsal root ganglion axons exhibit a tension buffering or strain-softening response, where its steady state elastic modulus decreases with increasing strain. We then explore the contributions from the various cytoskeletal components of the axon to show that the recently discovered membrane-associated actin-spectrin scaffold plays a prominent mechanical role. Finally, using a theoretical model, we argue that the actin-spectrin skeleton acts as an axonal tension buffer by reversibly unfolding repeat domains of the spectrin tetramers to release excess mechanical stress. Our results revise the current view point that microtubules and their associated proteins are the only significant load-bearing elements in axons.

Aberrant metabolism is a key factor in many neurological disorders. The ability to measure such metabolic impairment could lead to improved detection of disease progression, and development and monitoring of new therapeutic approaches. Hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a developing imaging technique that enables non-invasive measurement of enzymatic activity in real time in living organisms. Primarily applied in the fields of cancer and cardiac disease so far, this metabolic imaging method has recently been used to investigate neurological disorders.

<p>by Hans-Ulrich Klein, Martin Schäfer, David A. Bennett, Holger Schwender, Philip L. De Jager</p>

Biomedical research studies have generated large multi-omic datasets to study complex diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: <i>myeloid cell differentiation</i>, <i>protein phosphorylation</i> and <i>synaptic signaling</i>. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased <i>CSF1</i> transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v_jJDUF2TbI" width="1" />

Chemotaxis of fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells is critical for embryonic development and wound healing. Fibroblast chemotaxis directed by a gradient of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) requires signaling through the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Diacylglycerol (DAG), the lipid product of PLC that activates conventional PKCs, is focally enriched at the up-gradient leading edge of fibroblasts responding to a shallow gradient of PDGF, signifying polarization. To explain the underlying mechanisms, we formulated reaction-diffusion models including as many as three putative feedback loops based on known biochemistry. These include the previously analyzed mechanism of substrate-buffering by myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and two newly considered feedback loops involving the lipid, phosphatidic acid (PA). DAG kinases and phospholipase D, the enzymes that produce PA, are identified as key regulators in the models. Paradoxically, increasing DAG kinase activity can enhance the robustness of DAG/active PKC polarization with respect to chemoattractant concentration while decreasing their whole-cell levels. Finally, in simulations of wound invasion, efficient collective migration is achieved with thresholds for chemotaxis matching those of polarization in the reaction-diffusion models. This multi-scale modeling framework offers testable predictions to guide further study of signal transduction and cell behavior that affect mesenchymal chemotaxis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qkKouQvyIrw" width="1" />

<p>Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of grey matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of <i>Nurr1/Nr4a2</i>, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.</p>

<p>Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract tracing and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, <i>Synodontis grandiops</i> and <i>S. nigriventris</i>, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for individual sound and electric discharge pulses. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target were largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.</p>

<p>In 1882, the Italian morphologist Giuseppe Bellonci correctly observed that crustaceans possess mushroom bodies, a finding only recently becoming substantiated: here the title page of his paper and a lithograph in it.



</p>
<br />
<p>In 1882, the Italian embryologist Giuseppe Bellonci introduced a nomenclature for structures in the stomatopod crustacean <i>Squilla mantis</i> that he claimed correspond to insect mushroom bodies, today recognized as cardinal centers that in insects mediate associative memory. The use of Bellonci's terminology has, through a series of misunderstandings and entrenched opinions, led to contesting views regarding whether centers in crustacean and insect brains that occupy corresponding locations and receive comparable multisensory inputs are homologous or homoplasic. The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 30s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans. Yet the same terminology has been repurposed by subsequent researchers to promote the very opposite view: that mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods and that equivalent centers in crustaceans evolved independently.</p>

Abstract
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease notably characterized by progressive motor symptoms. Although the loss of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum has been associated with motor deficits, premanifest patients already present cognitive deficiencies and show early signs of motor disabilities. Here, in a YAC128 HD mouse model, we identified impairment in motor skill consolidation at the age of 11–14 weeks. Using optogenetic stimulation, we found that excitatory synaptic transmission from motor cortex to MSNs located in the dorsolateral part of the striatum (DLS) is altered. Using single pellet reaching task, we observed that while motor skill consolidation is accompanied by a dynamic change in AMPA/NMDA ratio in wild-type (WT) mice, this form of synaptic plasticity does not occur in YAC128 mice. This study not only proposes new meaningful insight in the synaptopathic mechanisms of HD, but also highlights that deficit in motor skill consolidation-dependent synaptic plasticity at motor cortex to DLS synapses represents an early biomarker for HD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To map <i>in vivo</i> cortical circuitry at the mesoscale we applied a novel approach to map inter‐areal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked inter‐areal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed area 3b connections with area 1; area 1 connections with areas 2 and 3a; area 2 connections with areas 1, 3a, and M1; area 3a connections with areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping inter‐areal and intra‐areal connections <i>in vivo</i>. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity is discussed.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the identification of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) as an endogenous ligand for the NOP receptor, ample evidence has revealed unique functional profiles of the N/OFQ‐NOP receptor system. NOP receptors are expressed in key neural substrates involved in pain and reward modulation. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), NOP receptor activation effectively exerts antinociception and anti‐hypersensitivity at the spinal and supraspinal levels. Moreover, NOP receptor activation inhibits dopaminergic transmission and synergistically enhances mu‐opioid peptide (MOP) receptor‐mediated analgesia. In this article, we have discussed the functional profiles of ligands with dual NOP and MOP receptor agonist activities and highlight their optimal functional efficacy for pain relief and drug abuse treatment. Through coactivation of NOP and MOP receptors, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor “partial” agonists (e.g., AT‐121, BU08028, and BU10038) reveal a wider therapeutic window with fewer side effects. These newly developed ligands potently induce antinociception without MOP receptor agonist‐associated side effects such as abuse potential, respiratory depression, itching sensation, and physical dependence. In addition, in both rodent and NHP models, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor agonists can attenuate reward processing and/or the reinforcing effects of opioids and other abused drugs. While a mixed NOP/opioid receptor “full” agonist cebranopadol is undergoing clinical trials, bifunctional NOP/MOP “partial” agonists exhibit promising therapeutic profiles in translational NHP models for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse. This class of drugs demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation, indicating a greater potential for future development.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00016">Frequency-Aware Summarization of Resting-State fMRI Data</a></h4>

<p>Many brain imaging modalities reveal interpretable patterns after the data dimensionality is reduced and summarized via data-driven approaches. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, such summarization is often achieved through independent component analysis (ICA). ICA transforms the original data into a relatively small number of interpretable bases in voxel space (referred to as ICA spatial components, or spatial maps) and corresponding bases in the time domain (referred to as time-courses of corresponding spatial maps) In this work, we use the word “basis” to broadly refer to either of the two factors resulting from the transformation. A precise summarization for fMRI requires accurately detecting co-activation of voxels by measuring temporal dependence. Accurate measurement of dependence requires a proper understanding of the underlying temporal characteristics of the data. One way to understand such characteristics is to study the frequency spectrum of fMRI data. Researchers have argued that information regarding the underlying neuronal activity might be spread over a range of frequencies as a result of the heterogeneous temporal nature of the neuronal activity, which is reflected in its frequency spectrum. Many studies have accounted for heterogeneous characteristics of the frequency of the signal by either directly inspecting the contents of frequency domain-transformed data or augmenting their analyses with such information. For example, studies on fMRI data have investigated brain functional connectivity by leveraging frequency-adjusted measures of dependence (e.g., when a correlation is measured as a function of frequency, as with “coherence”). Although these studies measure dependence as a function of frequency, the formulation does not capture all characteristics of the frequency-based dependence. Incorporating frequency information into a summarization approach would enable the retention of important frequency-related information that exists in the original space but might be lost after performing a frequency-independent summarization. We propose a novel data-driven approach built upon ICA, which is based on measuring dependence as a generalized function of frequency. Applying this approach to fMRI data provides evidence of existing cross-frequency functional connectivity between different areas of the brain.</p>

<p>Chronic tinnitus is a prevalent condition that could cause severe negative impact on an individual’s life. However, there has not been an established treatment due to a limited understanding of the pathophysiology of this multifarious disorder. In this study, we tested the efficacy of an integrative treatment, combining music therapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We collected three groups of patients receiving three different treatments: Music-CBT, music therapy and CBT. We used both subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e., resting-state EEG data) measurements to assess the behavioral and neural changes brought upon by the treatments. Analyses of the subjective measurements found a significant improvement of scale scores in Music-CBT and CBT, but not in the Music group. Analysis of the EEG data further showed increased powers in alpha and theta band after the Music-CBT treatment, and increased gamma power after CBT, whereas no significant difference was found for the music therapy. Further source localization analysis of alpha and theta changes in the Music-CBT group found that primary sources of the changes were located at auditory processing regions such as superior temporal gyrus, and higher emotional and cognitive processing regions such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), lateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus. These results indicated that Music-CBT was effective in improving tinnitus symptoms on both a behavioral and neural level, which is more robust than the music therapy or CBT alone.</p>

<p>Preclinical mental health research relies upon animal models, and whilst many encouraging advances are being made, reproducibility and translational relevance may be limited by sub-optimal testing or model choices. Animal behaviors are complex and test batteries should be designed to include their multifaceted nature. However, multiple behavioral testing is often avoided due to cost, availability or statistical rigor. Additionally, despite the disparity in the incidence of mental health problems between the sexes, a move toward reducing animal numbers could be a deterrent to including both male and female animals. The current study introduces a unified scoring system for specific behavioral traits with the aim of maximizing the use of all data generated whilst reducing the incidence of statistical errors. Female and male mice from two common background strains were tested on behavior batteries designed to probe multiple aspects of anxiety-related and social behavioral traits. Results for every outcome measure were normalized to generate scores for each test and combined to give each mouse a single unified score for each behavioral trait. The unified behavioral scores revealed clear differences in the anxiety and stress-related, and sociability traits of mice. Principle component analysis of data demonstrated significant clustering of animals into their experimental groups. In contrast, individual tests returned an ambiguous mixture of non-significant trends and significant effects for various outcome measures. Utilizing a range of behavioral measures and combining all outcome measure data to produce unified scores provides a useful tool for detecting subtle behavioral traits in preclinical models.</p>

<p>Neural transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) offers to replace cells lost during the progression of the disease process. Primary fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM), the origin of bona fide midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) precursors, is currently the gold standard source of cells for transplantation in PD. However, the use of tissue from this source raises ethical and logistical constraints necessitating the need for alternative supplies of donor cells. The requirement of any alternative donor cell source is to have the capability to generate authentic mature DAergic neurons, which could be utilized in cell-replacement strategies. Mouse pluripotent stem cells can efficiently generate electrochemically mature midbrain DAergic precursors in vitro using a stepwise control of FGF signaling. Here, we have compared DAergic transplants derived from two progenitor cell sources in an allograft system: mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) and primary fetal mouse VM tissue. Cells were transplanted into the striatum of 6-OHDA lesioned mice pre-treated with L-DOPA. Drug-induced rotations, a number of motor tests and drug-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were assessed. Functional improvements were demonstrated post-transplantation in some behavioral tests, with no difference in graft volume or the number of TH immuno-positive cells in the grafts of the two transplant groups. L-DOPA-induced AIMs and amphetamine-induced AIMs were observed in both transplant groups, with no differences in rate or severity between the two groups. Collectively, in this mouse-to-mouse allograft system, we report no significant differences in the functional ability between the gold standard primary VM derived and pluripotent stem cell-derived DAergic transplants.</p>

<p>Proteins of the 14-3-3 family are well known modulators of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) regulating kinase activity, cellular localization, and ubiquitylation. Although binding between those proteins has been investigated, a comparative study of all human 14-3-3 isoforms interacting with LRRK2 is lacking so far. In a comprehensive approach, we quantitatively analyzed the interaction between the seven human 14-3-3 isoforms and LRRK2-derived peptides covering both, reported and putative 14-3-3 binding sites. We observed that phosphorylation is an absolute prerequisite for 14-3-3 binding and generated binding patterns of 14-3-3 isoforms to interact with peptides derived from the N-terminal phosphorylation cluster (S910 and S935), the Roc domain (S1444) and the C-terminus. The tested 14-3-3 binding sites in LRRK2 preferentially were recognized by the isoforms γ and η, whereas the isoforms ϵ and especially σ showed the weakest or no binding. Interestingly, the possible pathogenic mutation Q930R in LRRK2 drastically increases binding affinity to a peptide encompassing pS935. We then identified the autophosphorylation site T2524 as a so far not described 14-3-3 binding site at the very C-terminus of LRRK2. Binding affinities of all seven 14-3-3 isoforms were quantified for all three binding regions with pS1444 displaying the highest affinity of all measured singly phosphorylated peptides. The strongest binding was detected for the combined phosphosites S910 and S935, suggesting that avidity effects are important for high affinity interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and LRRK2.</p>

<p>This article reviews the basic principles of frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS), which relies on intensity-modulated light sources and phase-sensitive optical detection, and its non-invasive applications to the brain. The simpler instrumentation and more straightforward data analysis of continuous-wave NIRS (CW-NIRS) accounts for the fact that almost all the current commercial instruments for cerebral NIRS have embraced the CW technique. However, FD-NIRS provides data with richer information content, which complements or exceeds the capabilities of CW-NIRS. One example is the ability of FD-NIRS to measure the absolute optical properties (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) of tissue, and thus the absolute concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in brain tissue. This article reviews the measured values of such optical properties and hemoglobin concentrations reported in the literature for animal models and for the human brain in newborns, infants, children, and adults. We also review the application of FD-NIRS to functional brain studies that focused on slower hemodynamic responses to brain activity (time scale of seconds) and faster optical signals that have been linked to neuronal activation (time scale of 100 ms). Another example of the power of FD-NIRS data is related to the different regions of sensitivity featured by intensity and phase data. We report recent developments that take advantage of this feature to maximize the sensitivity of non-invasive optical signals to brain tissue relative to more superficial extracerebral tissue (scalp, skull, etc.). We contend that this latter capability is a highly appealing quality of FD-NIRS, which complements absolute optical measurements and may result in significant advances in the field of non-invasive optical sensing of the brain.</p>

<p>Speech production is a hierarchical mechanism involving the synchronization of the brain and the oral articulators, where the intention of linguistic concepts is transformed into meaningful sounds. Individuals with locked-in syndrome (fully paralyzed but aware) lose their motor ability completely including articulation and even eyeball movement. The neural pathway may be the only option to resume a certain level of communication for these patients. Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use patients' visual and attentional correlates to build communication, resulting in a slow communication rate (a few words per minute). Direct decoding of imagined speech from the neural signals (and then driving a speech synthesizer) has the potential for a higher communication rate. In this study, we investigated the decoding of five imagined and spoken phrases from single-trial, non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals collected from eight adult subjects. Two machine learning algorithms were used. One was an artificial neural network (ANN) with statistical features as the baseline approach. The other was convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied on the spatial, spectral and temporal features extracted from the MEG signals. Experimental results indicated the possibility to decode imagined and spoken phrases directly from neuromagnetic signals. CNNs were found to be highly effective with an average decoding accuracy of up to 93% for the imagined and 96% for the spoken phrases.</p>

<p>The assessment and prediction of cognitive performance is a key issue for any discipline concerned with human operators in the context of safety-critical behavior. Most of the research has focused on the measurement of mental workload but this construct remains difficult to operationalize despite decades of research on the topic. Recent advances in Neuroergonomics have expanded our understanding of neurocognitive processes across different operational domains. We provide a framework to disentangle those neural mechanisms that underpin the relationship between task demand, arousal, mental workload and human performance. This approach advocates targeting those specific mental states that precede a reduction of performance efficacy. A number of undesirable neurocognitive states (mind wandering, effort withdrawal, perseveration, inattentional phenomena) are identified and mapped within a two-dimensional conceptual space encompassing task engagement and arousal. We argue that monitoring the prefrontal cortex and its deactivation can index a generic shift from a nominal operational state to an impaired one where performance is likely to degrade. Neurophysiological, physiological and behavioral markers that specifically account for these states are identified. We then propose a typology of neuroadaptive countermeasures to mitigate these undesirable mental states.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia. Symptoms of AD include memory loss, disorientation, mood and behavior changes, confusion, unfounded suspicions, and eventually, difficulty speaking, swallowing, and walking. These symptoms are caused by neuronal degeneration and cell loss that begins in the hippocampus, and later in disease progression spreading to the rest of the brain. While there are some medications that alleviate initial symptoms, there are currently no treatments that stop disease progression. Hippocampal deficits in amyloid-β-related rodent models of AD have revealed synaptic, behavioral and circuit-level defects. These changes in synaptic function, plasticity, neuronal excitability, brain connectivity, and excitation/inhibition imbalance all have profound effects on circuit function, which in turn could exacerbate disease progression. Despite, the wealth of studies on AD pathology we don’t yet have a complete understanding of hippocampal deficits in AD. With the increasing development of in vivo recording techniques in awake and freely moving animals, future studies will extend our current knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning how hippocampal function is altered in AD, and aid in progression of treatment strategies that prevent and/or delay AD symptoms.</p>

<p>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often behaviorally hyper-reactive to light touch, but it is unclear to what degree this arises from a fundamental sensory difference vs. higher order systems for attention or emotion processing. Thus far, experimental findings for light touch detection are mixed, and few previous studies have independently considered sensitivity (the ability to discriminate signal from noise) and decision criterion (the overall response bias or tendency to answer “yes” or “no” in a detection task). We tested a large sample of children, adolescents, and adults with ASD (n = 88) and with neurotypical (NT) development (n = 59) using von Frey filaments to derive light touch thresholds at the palm. We calculated signal detection metrics for sensitivity (A<sub>z</sub>) and response criterion (c) from hit and false alarm rates. Both metrics exhibited significant group differences, such that the ASD group was less sensitive, but had a much more conservative response criterion. We used a best subset model selection procedure in three separate ordinal regressions for the whole group, adults, and children/adolescents. In all selected models, c was by far the most significant predictor of threshold, supplanting effects of diagnostic group that were significant in the baseline models. In contrast, Az was not a significant predictor of threshold in any of the models. Mean values of c were similar for adults with and without autism and for children/adolescents with ASD, but lower (more liberal) in neurotypical children/adolescents. This suggests that children with ASD exhibit a conservatism in their perceptual decision-making that differs from their NT peers but resembles that of adults. Across the sample, the value of c was significantly and positively correlated with age and with autism symptoms (SRS-2 total score), in addition to thresholds. The results of this study suggest that, rather than a sensory difference in detection of light touch, there is a difference in response bias such that children with ASD are more conservative/likely to report “no” if unsure, than their young NT peers. Future work should consider the implications of conservative response criterion in ASD for commonly used forced-choice psychophysical paradigms.</p>

<p>Major neurocognitive changes occur during adolescence, making this phase one of the most critical developmental periods of life. Furthermore, this phase in life is also the time in which youth substance use begins. Several studies have demonstrated the differential associations of alcohol and cannabis use concerning the neurocognitive functioning of both males and females. Past and contemporary literature on gender-specific effects in neuroscience of addiction is predominantly based on cross-sectional datasets and data that is limited in terms of measurement variability. Given the importance of gender-specific effects in addiction studies, and in order to address the two above-mentioned gaps in the literature, the present study aimed to compare neurocognitive functioning of male and female adolescents in the context of cannabis and alcohol use, while employing a longitudinal design with multiple repeated measurements. Participants were 3,826 high school students (47% female; mean age, 12.7), who were recruited from 31 high schools in the greater Montreal area. Participants were requested to complete annual surveys for five consecutive years, from 7th to 11th grade, assessing their alcohol/cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning (working memory, delayed recall memory, perceptual reasoning, and inhibition control). The analytical strategy focused on the longitudinal association between each predictor (female, male) and each of the outcomes (domains of neurocognitive functioning). Multilevel linear models assessed the association of alcohol and cannabis consumption and the four domains of neurocognitive functioning. Results revealed a gender by within-subject interaction, suggesting a weaker effect of yearly fluctuation of cannabis use on working memory among males compared to females. Our findings suggest a different pattern of neurocognitive impairment of female and male working memory after using cannabis over the course of adolescence. Early initiation of cannabis use potentially results in more spatial working memory deficits in female adolescents. This may negatively influence young females’ capacity in academic settings and lead to significant impairment in adulthood, which critically decreases the individual’s quality of life.</p>

<p>Recent success stories in automated object or face recognition, partly fuelled by deep learning artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, have led to the advancement of biometric research platforms and, to some extent, the resurrection of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In line with this general trend, inter-disciplinary approaches have been taken to automate the recognition of emotions in adults or children for the benefit of various applications, such as identification of children's emotions prior to a clinical investigation. Within this context, it turns out that automating emotion recognition is far from being straightforward, with several challenges arising for both science (e.g., methodology underpinned by psychology) and technology (e.g., the iMotions biometric research platform). In this paper, we present a methodology and experiment and some interesting findings, which raise the following research questions for the recognition of emotions and attention in humans: (a) the adequacy of well-established techniques such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), (b) the adequacy of state-of-the-art biometric research platforms, (c) the extent to which emotional responses may be different in children and adults. Our findings and first attempts to answer some of these research questions are based on a mixed sample of adults and children who took part in the experiment, resulting in a statistical analysis of numerous variables. These are related to both automatically and interactively captured responses of participants to a sample of IAPS pictures.</p>

<p>Most stroke studies dealing with functional deficits and assessing stem cell therapy produce extensive hemispheric damage and can be seen as a model for severe clinical strokes. However, mild strokes have a better prospect for functional recovery. Recently, anatomic and behavioral changes have been reported for distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), generating a well-circumscribed and small cortical lesion, which can thus be proposed as mild to moderate cortical stroke. Using this cortical stroke model of moderate severity in the nude mouse, we have studied the functional networks with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 12 weeks following stroke induction. Further, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) were implanted adjacent to the ischemic lesion, and the stable graft vitality was monitored with bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Differentiation of the grafted neural stem cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Following stroke induction, we found a pronounced and continuously rising hypersynchronicity of the sensorimotor networks including both hemispheres, in contrast to the severe stroke filament model where profound reduction of the functional connectivity had been reported by us earlier. The vitality of grafted neural stem cells remained stable throughout the whole 12 weeks observation period. In the stem cell treated animals, functional connectivity did not show hypersynchronicity but was globally slightly reduced below baseline at 2 weeks post-stroke, normalizing thereafter completely. Our resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies on cortical stroke reveal for the first time a hypersynchronicity of the functional brain networks. This hypersynchronicity appears as a hallmark of mild cortical strokes, in contrast to severe strokes with striatal involvement where exclusively hyposynchronicity has been reported. The effect of the stem cell graft was an early and persistent normalization of the functional sensorimotor networks across the whole brain. These novel functional results may help interpret future outcome investigations after stroke and demonstrate the highly promising potential of stem cell treatment for functional outcome improvement after stroke.</p>

<p>Myelination is an essential process that consists of the ensheathment of axons by myelin. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is synthesized by oligodendrocytes. The proliferation, migration, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells constitute a prerequisite before mature oligodendrocytes extend their processes around the axons and progressively generate a multilamellar lipidic sheath. Although myelination is predominately driven by oligodendrocytes, the other glial cells including astrocytes and microglia, also contribute to this process. The present review is an update of the most recent emerging mechanisms involving astrocyte and microglia in myelin production. The contribution of these cells will be first described during developmental myelination that occurs in the early postnatal period and is critical for the proper development of cognition and behavior. Then, we will report the novel findings regarding the beneficial or deleterious effects of astroglia and microglia, which respectively promote or impair the endogenous capacity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to induce spontaneous remyelination after myelin loss. Acute delineation of astrocyte and microglia activities and cross-talk should uncover the way towards novel therapeutic perspectives aimed at recovering proper myelination during development or at breaking down the barriers impeding the regeneration of the damaged myelin that occurs in CNS demyelinating diseases.</p>

<p>Depression is a common affective disorder characterized by significant and persistent low mood. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is reported to have a rapid and durable antidepressant effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in cell signaling. Thus, we present a phosphoproteomics approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying stress-induced depression and the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine in mice. We analyzed the phosphoprotein changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and ketamine treatment in two known mood control centers, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We initially obtained &gt;8,000 phosphorylation sites. Quantitation revealed 3,988 sites from the mPFC and 3,196 sites from the NAc. Further analysis revealed that changes in synaptic transmission-related signaling are a common feature. Notably, CUMS-induced changes were reversed by ketamine treatment, as shown by the analysis of commonly altered sites. Ketamine also induced specific changes, such as alterations in synapse organization, synaptic transmission, and enzyme binding. Collectively, our findings establish a signaling framework for stress-induced depression and the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine.</p>

<p>Despite the extensive use of hormonal methods as either contraception or menopausal hormone therapy (HT), there is very little known about the potential effects of these compounds on the cellular processes of the brain. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) is a progestogen used globally in the hormonal contraceptive, Depo Provera, by women in their reproductive prime and is a major compound found in HT formulations used by menopausal women. MPA promotes changes in the circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-9, in the endometrium, yet limited literature studying the effects of MPA on neurons and astroglia cells has been conducted. Additionally, the dysregulation of MMPs has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where inhibiting the secretion of MMP-9 from astroglia reduces the proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta. Thus, we hypothesize that exposure to MPA disrupts proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta through the downregulation of MMP-9 expression and subsequent secretion. To assess the effect of progestins on MMP-9 and amyloid-beta, in vitro, C6 rat glial cells were exposed to MPA for 48 h and then the enzymatic, secretory, and amyloid-beta degrading capacity of MMP-9 was assessed from the conditioned culture medium. We found that MPA treatment inhibited transcription of MMP-9, which resulted in a subsequent decrease in the production and secretion of MMP-9 protein, in part through the glucocorticoid receptor. Additionally, we investigated the consequences of amyloid beta-degrading activity and found that MPA treatment decreased proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta. Our results suggest MPA suppresses amyloid-beta degradation in an MMP-9-dependent manner, in vitro, and potentially compromises the clearance of amyloid-beta in vivo.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56418">Post-translational regulation of retinal IMPDH1 in vivo to adjust GTP synthesis to illumination conditions</a></h4>

We report the in vivo regulation of Inosine-5´-monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) in the retina. IMPDH1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, impacting the cellular pools of GMP, GDP and GTP. Guanine nucleotide homeostasis is central to photoreceptor cells, where cGMP is the signal transducing molecule in the light response. Mutations in IMPDH1 lead to inherited blindness. We unveil a light-dependent phosphorylation of retinal IMPDH1 at Thr<sup>159</sup>/Ser<sup>160</sup> in the Bateman domain that desensitizes the enzyme to allosteric inhibition by GDP/GTP. When exposed to bright light, living mice increase the rate of GTP and ATP synthesis in their retinas; concomitant with IMPDH1 aggregate formation at the outer segment layer. Inhibiting IMPDH activity in living mice delays rod mass recovery. We unveil a novel mechanism of regulation of IMPDH1 in vivo, important for understanding GTP homeostasis in the retina and the pathogenesis of adRP10 IMPDH1 mutations.

Existing C57BL/6J Sarm1−/− mouse lines were made on the 129 background, and genes surrounding the knockout locus remain 129 in sequence. Uccellini et al. show that CRISPR mouse lines retain decreased axonal degeneration and increased WNV susceptibility, but not VSV or LACV viral phenotypes or chemokine or Xaf1 expression phenotypes.

Activation of NF-κB via STING is considered to be exclusively dependent on TBK1. Balka et al. now show that, although TBK1 and its kinase activity are critical for IRF3 activation and type I IFNs, it is dispensable for NF-κB. Instead, TBK1 and IKKε act redundantly to mediate STING-induced NF-κB responses.

<p>by Noriki Fujimoto, Yuliang He, Marco D’Addio, Carlotta Tacconi, Michael Detmar, Lothar C. Dieterich</p>

Lymph nodes (LNs) are highly organized secondary lymphoid organs that mediate adaptive immune responses to antigens delivered via afferent lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) line intranodal lymphatic sinuses and organize lymph and antigen distribution. LECs also directly regulate T cells, mediating peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, and play a major role in many diseases, including cancer metastasis. However, little is known about the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of LN LECs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively defined the transcriptome of LECs in murine skin-draining LNs and identified new markers and functions of distinct LEC subpopulations. We found that LECs residing in the subcapsular sinus (SCS) have an unanticipated function in scavenging of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and also identified a specific cortical LEC subtype implicated in rapid lymphocyte egress from LNs. Our data provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the diversity of LECs in murine LNs and a rich resource for future studies into the regulation of immune responses by LN LECs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Q_CXYqi-SUY" width="1" />

<p>The safety and efficacy of opioids are compromised as analgesic tolerance develops. Opioids are also ineffective against neuropathic pain. Recent reports have suggested that inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), may have analgesic effects in cancer patients suffering from neuropathic pain. It has been shown that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), an RTK that has been shown to interact with the EGFR, mediates opioid tolerance but does not induce analgesia. Therefore, we sought to determine whether EGFR signaling was involved in opioid tolerance and whether EGFR and PDGFR signaling could induce pain in rats. We found that gefitinib, an EGFR antagonist, eliminated morphine tolerance. In addition, repeated EGF administration rendered animals unresponsive to subsequent analgesic doses of morphine, a phenomenon we call "pre-tolerance." Using a nerve injury model, we found that gefitinib alone was not analgesic. Rather, it reversed insensitivity to morphine analgesia (pre-tolerance) caused by the release of EGF by injured nerves. We also showed that repeated, but not acute EGF or PDGF-BB administration induced mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. EGFR and PDGFR-β signaling interacted to produce this sensitization. EGFR was widely expressed in primary sensory afferent cell bodies, demonstrating a neuroanatomical substrate for our findings. Taken together, our results suggest a direct mechanistic link between opioid tolerance and mechanical sensitization. EGFR antagonism could eventually play an important clinical role in the treatment of opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain that is refractory to opioid treatment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A major challenge in medicine is developing potent pain therapies without the adverse effects of opiates. Neuroinflammation and in particular microglial activation have been shown to contribute to these effects. However, the implication of the microglial mu opioid receptor (MOR) is not known. We developed a novel conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line, wherein MOR is deleted in microglia. Morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed in both sexes in cKO mice in the hot plate assay. Opioid‐induced hyperalgesia (OIH) as measured in the tail immersion assay was abolished in male cKO mice, and physical dependence to morphine as assessed by naloxone‐induced withdrawal was attenuated in female cKO mice. Our results show a sex‐dependent contribution of microglial MOR in morphine analgesic tolerance, OIH, and physical dependence. In conclusion, our data suggest that blockade of microglial MOR could represent a therapeutic target for opiate analgesia without the opiate adverse effects.</p>

Fernandes et al. report causal connections between postingestive sucrose sensing and brain dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area that support food seeking. The authors further demonstrate that such behaviors and the associated neuron activity are mediated by the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize predictors of recovery and outcome following pediatric arterial ischemic stroke, hypothesizing that age influences recovery after stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied children enrolled in the International Pediatric Stroke Study between January 1, 2003 and July 31, 2014 with 2‐year follow‐up after arterial ischemic stroke. Outcomes were defined at discharge by clinician grading and at 2 years by the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic outcome predictors were examined. We defined changes in outcome from discharge to 2 years as recovery (improved outcome), emerging deficit (worse outcome), or no change.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our population consisted of 587 patients, including 174 with neonatal stroke and 413 with childhood stroke, with recurrent stroke in 8.2% of childhood patients. Moderate to severe neurological impairment was present in 9.4% of neonates versus 48.8% of children at discharge compared to 8.0% versus 24.7% after 2 years. Predictors of poor outcome included age between 28 days and 1 year (compared to neonates, odds ratio [OR] = 3.58, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), underlying chronic disorder (OR = 2.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and involvement of both small and large vascular territories (OR = 2.84, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Recovery patterns differed, with emerging deficits more common in children &lt;1 year of age (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Outcomes after pediatric stroke are generally favorable, but moderate to severe neurological impairments are still common. Age between 28 days and 1 year appears to be a particularly vulnerable period. Understanding the timing and predictors of recovery will allow us to better counsel families and target therapies to improve outcomes after pediatric stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, <i>Asymmetron lucayanum</i>. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the non‐myelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In <i>Asymmetron</i>, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.</p>

<p>Understanding force generation in nonequilibrium systems is a notable challenge in statistical physics. We uncover a fluctuation-induced force between two plates immersed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The force is a nonmonotonic function of plate separation. The mechanism of force generation reveals an intriguing analogy with fluctuation-induced forces: In a fluid, energy and vorticity are localized in regions of defined length scales. When varying the distance between the plates, we exclude energy structures modifying the overall pressure on the plates. At intermediate plate distances, the intense vorticity structures (worms) are forced to interact in close vicinity between the plates. This interaction affects the pressure in the slit and the force between the plates. The combination of these two effects causes a nonmonotonic attractive force with a complex Reynolds number dependence. Our study sheds light on how length scale–dependent distributions of energy and high-intensity vortex structures determine Casimir forces.</p>

<p>Numerous plants and animals harbor selfish B chromosomes that "drive" or transmit themselves at super-Mendelian frequencies, despite long-term fitness costs to the organism. Currently, it is unknown how B chromosome drive is mediated, and whether B-gene expression plays a role. We used modern sequencing technologies to analyze the fine-scale sequence composition and expression of paternal sex ratio (PSR), a B chromosome in the jewel wasp <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i>. PSR causes female-to-male conversion by destroying the sperm’s hereditary material in young embryos to drive. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that testis-specific expression of a PSR-linked gene, named <i>haploidizer</i>, facilitates this genome elimination–and–sex conversion effect. <i>haploidizer</i> encodes a putative protein with a DNA binding domain, suggesting a functional link with the sperm-derived chromatin.</p>

<p>Liquid emulsion droplet evaporation is of importance for various sensing and imaging applications. The liquid-to-gas phase transformation is typically triggered thermally or acoustically by low–boiling point liquids, or by inclusion of solid structures that pin the vapor/liquid contact line to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation. However, these approaches lack precise tunability in vaporization behavior. Here, we describe a previously unused approach to control vaporization behavior through an endoskeleton that can melt and blend into the liquid core to either enhance or disrupt cohesive intermolecular forces. This effect is demonstrated using perfluoropentane (C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>) droplets encapsulating a fluorocarbon (FC) or hydrocarbon (HC) endoskeleton. FC skeletons inhibit vaporization, whereas HC skeletons trigger vaporization near the rotator melting transition. Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal interfacial mixing for initiating droplet vaporization. Tuning molecular interactions between the endoskeleton and droplet phase is generalizable for achieving emulsion or other secondary phase transitions, in emulsions.</p>

<p>Observations indicate a strong correlation between the occurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. While increased volcanic activity has been observed following both local and distal earthquakes, some of the largest recorded earthquakes aren’t known to have triggered an eruption. Here we investigate whether an eruption and associated dike intrusion at Ambrym volcano was triggered by an <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.4 earthquake which occurred 30 hours earlier. Modeling suggests that stress changes induced by the earthquake were too small to account for the overpressure in the dike without additional bubble growth to pressurize the magma chamber. We find that the magma must be both H<sub>2</sub>O-saturated and at lower temperatures than those expected for newly intruded basalts. Too hot and the stress drop required to grow the bubbles is too large, too cold and the magma can no longer flow. These observations suggest that partially cooled and crystallized basaltic magmas are more susceptible to triggering from earthquakes.</p>

<p>Patterned cell divisions require a precisely oriented spindle that segregates chromosomes and determines the cytokinetic plane. In this study, we investigated how the meiotic spindle orients through an obligatory rotation during meiotic division in mouse oocytes. We show that spindle rotation occurs at the completion of chromosome segregation, whereby the separated chromosome clusters each define a cortical actomyosin domain that produces cytoplasmic streaming, resulting in hydrodynamic forces on the spindle. These forces are initially balanced but become unbalanced to drive spindle rotation. This force imbalance is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the distribution of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin-II on the cortex, brought about by feedback loops comprising Ran guanosine triphosphatase signaling, Arp2/3 complex activity, and myosin-II contractility. The torque produced by the unbalanced hydrodynamic forces, coupled with a pivot point at the spindle midzone cortical contract, constitutes a unique mechanical system for meiotic spindle rotation.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.</p>

<p>The lubrication properties of nanoconfined liquids underpin countless natural and industrial processes. However, our current understanding of lubricated friction is still limited, especially for nonideal interfaces exhibiting nanoscale chemical and topographical defects. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to explore the equilibrium and dynamical behavior of a model lubricant, squalane, confined between a diamond tip and graphite in the vicinity of an atomic step. We combine high-resolution imaging of the interface with highly localized shear measurements at different velocities and temperatures to derive a quantitative picture of the lubricated friction around surface defects. We show that defects tend to promote local molecular order and increase friction forces by reducing the number of stable molecular configurations in their immediate vicinity. The effect is general, can propagate over hundreds of nanometers, and can be quantitatively described by a semiempirical model that bridges the molecular details and mesoscale observations.</p>

<p>Oxygen activation is a critical step in ubiquitous heterogeneous oxidative processes, most prominently in catalysis, electrolysis, and pharmaceutical applications. We present here our findings on metal-free O<sub>2</sub> activation on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) as an important class of N-rich materials. The O<sub>2</sub> activation process was studied for the formation of aldehydes, ketones and imines. A detailed mechanistic study of O<sub>2</sub> activation and the role of nitrogen heteroatoms were comprehensively investigated. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and control experiments provide strong evidence for the reaction mechanism proving the applicability of the CTFs to activate oxygen into superoxide species. This report highlights the importance of a self-templating procedure to introduce N functionalities for the development of metal-free catalytic materials. The presented findings reveal an important step toward the use of CTFs as inexpensive and high-performance alternatives to metal-based materials not only for catalysis but also for biorelated applications dealing with O<sub>2</sub> activation.</p>

<p>We study the effect of rotational state–dependent alignment in the scattering of molecules by optical fields. CS<sub>2</sub> molecules in their lowest few rotational states are adiabatically aligned and transversely accelerated by a nonresonant optical standing wave. The width of the measured transverse velocity distribution increases to 160 m/s with the field intensity, while its central peak position moves from 10 to –10 m/s. These changes are well reproduced by numerical simulations based on the rotational state–dependent alignment but cannot be modeled when ignoring these effects. Moreover, the molecular scattering by an off-resonant optical field amounts to manipulating the translational motion of molecules in a rotational state–specific way. Conversely, our results demonstrate that scattering from a nonresonant optical standing wave is a viable method for rotational state selection of nonpolar molecules.</p>

<p>Blue natural pigments are rare, especially among plants. However, flowering species that evolved to attract Hymenoptera pollinators are colored by blue anthocyanin-metal complexes. Plants lacking anthocyanins are pigmented by betalains but are unable to produce blue hues. By extending the -system of betalains, we designed a photostable and metal-free blue dye named BeetBlue that did not show toxicity to human hepatic and retinal pigment epithelial cells and does not affect zebrafish embryonal development. This chiral dye can be conveniently synthesized from betalamic acid obtained from hydrolyzed red beetroot juice or by enzymatic oxidation of l-dopa. BeetBlue is blue in the solid form and in solution of acidified polar molecular solvents, including water. Its capacity to dye natural matrices makes BeetBlue the prototype of a new class of low-cost bioinspired chromophores suitable for a myriad of applications requiring a blue hue.</p>

<p>Nanobubbles (NBs) are nanoscopic gaseous domains than can exist on solid surfaces or in bulk liquids. They have attracted substantial attention due to their long-time (meta)stability and a high potential for real-world applications. Using an approach not previously investigated, we exploit surface-electrostatic NB formation and stabilization via application of external electric fields in gas-liquid systems, with the marked result of massively increased gas uptake into the liquid in NB form. The de facto gas solubility enhancement (over many months) ranges from 2.5-fold for oxygen to 30-fold for methane vis-à-vis respective Henry’s law values for gas solubility; the more hydrophobic the gas, the more spectacular the increase. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the origin of NBs’ movement lies in dielectrophoresis, while substantial NB stabilization arises from a surface-polarization interaction.</p>

<p>Personal moisture management fabrics that facilitate sweat transport away from the skin are highly desirable for wearer’s comfort and performance. Here, we demonstrate a "skin-like" directional liquid transport fabric, which enables continuous one-way liquid flow through spatially distributed channels acting like "sweating glands" yet repels external liquid contaminants. The water transmission rate can be 15 times greater than that of best commercial breathable fabrics. This exceptional property is achieved by creating gradient wettability channels across a predominantly superhydrophobic substrate. The flow directionality is explained by the Gibbs pinning criterion. The permeability, mechanical property, and abrasion resistance (up to 10,000 cycles) of the fabric were not affected by the treatment. In addition to functional clothing, this concept can be extended for developing materials for oil-water separation, wound dressing, geotechnical engineering, flexible microfluidics, and fuel cell membranes.</p>

<p>Here, we describe a tripartite circular single-stranded (ss) DNA mycovirus, named Fusarium graminearum gemytripvirus 1 (FgGMTV1). The genome of FgGMTV1 comprises three circular ssDNA segments (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that FgGMTV1 is nested within the family Genomoviridae. We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus. Our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may have evolved from a monopartite genome of an ancient genomovirus.</p>

<p>Deep-sea cold seeps are dynamic sources of methane release and unique habitats supporting ocean biodiversity and productivity. Here, we describe newly discovered animal-bacterial symbioses fueled by methane, between two species of annelid (a serpulid <i>Laminatubus</i> and sabellid <i>Bispira</i>) and distinct aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Methylococcales, localized to the host respiratory crown. Worm tissue <sup>13</sup>C of –44 to –58 are consistent with methane-fueled nutrition for both species, and shipboard stable isotope labeling experiments revealed active assimilation of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled methane into animal biomass, which occurs via the engulfment of methanotrophic bacteria across the crown epidermal surface. These worms represent a new addition to the few animals known to intimately associate with methane-oxidizing bacteria and may further explain their enigmatic mass occurrence at 150–million year–old fossil seeps. High-resolution seafloor surveys document significant coverage by these symbioses, beyond typical obligate seep fauna. These findings uncover novel consumers of methane in the deep sea and, by expanding the known spatial extent of methane seeps, may have important implications for deep-sea conservation.</p>

<p>Transient tunnels that assemble and disassemble to facilitate passage of unstable intermediates in enzymes containing multiple reaction centers are controlled by allosteric cues. Using the 140-kDa purine biosynthetic enzyme PurL as a model system and a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, we show that long-distance communication between ~25-Å distal active sites is initiated by an allosteric switch, residing in a conserved catalytic loop, adjacent to the synthetase active site. Further, combinatory experiments seeded from molecular dynamics simulations help to delineate transient states that bring out the central role of nonfunctional adaptor domains. We show that carefully orchestrated conformational changes, facilitated by interplay of dynamic interactions at the allosteric switch and adaptor-domain interface, control reactivity and concomitant formation of the ammonia tunnel. This study asserts that substrate channeling is modulated by allosteric hotspots that alter protein energy landscape, thereby allowing the protein to adopt transient conformations paramount to function.</p>

<p>Metal oxide semiconductor junctions are central to most electronic and optoelectronic devices, but ultrafast measurements of carrier transport have been limited to device-average measurements. Here, charge transport and recombination kinetics in each layer of a Ni-TiO<sub>2</sub>-Si junction is measured using the element specificity of broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ultrafast pulses. After silicon photoexcitation, holes are inferred to transport from Si to Ni ballistically in ~100 fs, resulting in characteristic spectral shifts in the XUV edges. Meanwhile, the electrons remain on Si. After picoseconds, the transient hole population on Ni is observed to back-diffuse through the TiO<sub>2</sub>, shifting the Ti spectrum to a higher oxidation state, followed by electron-hole recombination at the Si-TiO<sub>2</sub> interface and in the Si bulk. Electrical properties, such as the hole diffusion constant in TiO<sub>2</sub> and the initial hole mobility in Si, are fit from these transient spectra and match well with values reported previously.</p>

<p>Stacking two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials with different interlayer atomic registry in a heterobilayer causes the formation of a long-range periodic superlattice that may bestow the heterostructure with properties such as new quantum fractal states or superconductivity. Recent optical measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers have revealed the presence of hybridized interlayer electron-hole pair excitations at energies defined by the superlattice potential. The corresponding quasiparticle band structures, so-called minibands, have remained elusive, and no such features have been reported for heterobilayers composed of a TMD and another type of 2D material. We introduce a new x-ray capillary technology for performing microfocused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of ~1 μm, and directly observe minibands at certain twist angles in mini Brillouin zones (mBZs). We discuss their origin in terms of initial and final state effects by analyzing their dispersion in distinct mBZs.</p>

<p>The high-lying vibrational states of the magnesium dimer (Mg<sub>2</sub>), which has been recognized as an important system in studies of ultracold and collisional phenomena, have eluded experimental characterization for half a century. Until now, only the first 14 vibrational states of Mg<sub>2</sub> have been experimentally resolved, although it has been suggested that the ground-state potential may support five additional levels. Here, we present highly accurate ab initio potential energy curves based on state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and full configuration interaction computations for the ground and excited electronic states involved in the experimental investigations of Mg<sub>2</sub>. Our ground-state potential unambiguously confirms the existence of 19 vibrational levels, with ~1 cm<sup>–1</sup> root mean square deviation between the calculated rovibrational term values and the available experimental and experimentally derived data. Our computations reproduce the latest laser-induced fluorescence spectrum and provide guidance for the experimental detection of the previously unresolved vibrational levels.</p>

<p>"Fake news," broadly defined as false or misleading information masquerading as legitimate news, is frequently asserted to be pervasive online with serious consequences for democracy. Using a unique multimode dataset that comprises a nationally representative sample of mobile, desktop, and television consumption, we refute this conventional wisdom on three levels. First, news consumption of any sort is heavily outweighed by other forms of media consumption, comprising at most 14.2% of Americans’ daily media diets. Second, to the extent that Americans do consume news, it is overwhelmingly from television, which accounts for roughly five times as much as news consumption as online. Third, fake news comprises only 0.15% of Americans’ daily media diet. Our results suggest that the origins of public misinformedness and polarization are more likely to lie in the content of ordinary news or the avoidance of news altogether as they are in overt fakery.</p>

<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations in β-cardiac myosin and myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) lead to hypercontractility of the heart, an early hallmark of HCM. We show that hypercontractility caused by the HCM-causing mutation R663H cannot be explained by changes in fundamental myosin contractile parameters, much like the HCM-causing mutation R403Q. Using enzymatic assays with purified human β-cardiac myosin, we provide evidence that both mutations cause hypercontractility by increasing the number of functionally accessible myosin heads. We also demonstrate that the myosin mutation R403Q, but not R663H, ablates the binding of myosin with the C0-C7 fragment of MyBP-C. Furthermore, addition of C0-C7 decreases the wild-type myosin basal ATPase single turnover rate, while the mutants do not show a similar reduction. These data suggest that a primary mechanism of action for these mutations is to increase the number of myosin heads functionally available for interaction with actin, which could contribute to hypercontractility.</p>

Have you ever sought to use metagenomic DNA sequences reported in scientific publications? Were you successful? Here, we reveal that metagenomes from no fewer than 20% of the papers found in our literature search, published between 2016 and 2019, were not deposited in a repository or were simply inaccessible. The proportion of inaccessible data within the literature has been increasing year-on-year. Noncompliance with Open Data is best predicted by the scientific discipline of the journal. The number of citations, journal type (e.g., Open Access or subscription journals), and publisher are not good predictors of data accessibility. However, many publications in high–impact factor journals do display a higher likelihood of accessible metagenomic data sets. Twenty-first century science demands compliance with the ethical standard of data sharing of metagenomes and DNA sequence data more broadly. Data accessibility must become one of the routine and mandatory components of manuscript submissions—a requirement that should be applicable across the increasing number of disciplines using metagenomics. Compliance must be ensured and reinforced by funders, publishers, editors, reviewers, and, ultimately, the authors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J64iz9TnOSQ" width="1" />

Histological atlases of the cerebral cortex, such as those made famous by Brodmann and von Economo, are invaluable for understanding human brain microstructure and its relationship with functional organization in the brain. However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering, macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional neuroanatomy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HwoRD4mJykw" width="1" />

Putting a name to a face is a highly common activity in our daily life that greatly enriches social interactions. Although this specific person–identity association becomes automatic with learning, it remains difficult and can easily be disrupted in normal circumstances or neurological conditions. To shed light on the neural basis of this important and yet poorly understood association between different input modalities in the human brain, we designed a crossmodal frequency-tagging paradigm coupled to brain activity recording via scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography. In Experiment 1, 12 participants were presented with variable pictures of faces and written names of a single famous identity at a 4-Hz frequency rate while performing an orthogonal task. Every 7 items, another famous identity appeared, either as a face or a name. Robust electrophysiological responses were found exactly at the frequency of identity change (i.e., 4 Hz / 7 = 0.571 Hz), suggesting a crossmodal neural response to person identity. In Experiment 2 with twenty participants, two control conditions with periodic changes of identity for faces or names only were added to estimate the contribution of unimodal neural activity to the putative crossmodal face-name responses. About 30% of the response occurring at the frequency of crossmodal identity change over the left occipito-temporal cortex could not be accounted for by the linear sum of unimodal responses. Finally, intracerebral recordings in the left ventral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in 7 epileptic patients tested with this paradigm revealed a small number of “pure” crossmodal responses, i.e., with no response to changes of identity for faces or names only. Altogether, these observations provide evidence for integration of verbal and nonverbal person identity-specific information in the human brain, highlighting the contribution of the left ventral ATL in the automatic retrieval of face-name identity associations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cTYTWtgKEDA" width="1" />
