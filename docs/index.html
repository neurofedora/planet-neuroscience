	<p>Burnout is becoming a global pandemic jeopardizing brain health, with a huge impact on quality of life, available workforce, and the economy. Knowledge of the impact of burnout on cognition, physiology, and physical activity (PA) in daily life allows for an improved understanding of the health consequences and everyday ramifications of burnout. Twenty-eight volunteers participated in a three-day recording of daily physiology and PA, including heart rate (HR) and daily steps, with a wearable device. They filled in questionnaires screening for burnout (BBI-15), depression (BDI), and executive functions (EFs) in daily life (BRIEF-A). The subjects with burnout had more challenges in EFs, higher average HRs and lower numbers of steps in daily life than those without it. The BBI-15 scores correlated positively with the BDI scores and BRIEF-A indices and negatively with the awake HR variability (HRV) and daily steps. The metacognition index correlated negatively with the HRV. In conclusion, burnout is linked with compromised EFs along with alterations in cardiac physiology and PA in daily life. Such alterations may be easily detected with wearable devices, opening possibilities for novel biomarkers of burnout and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We suggest that physical activity and heart and brain health are intimately intertwined and that burnout interacts with each of them bidirectionally.</p>

	<p>Executive function (EF) includes a set of higher-order abilities that control one&amp;amp;rsquo;s actions and thoughts consciously and has a protracted developmental trajectory that parallels the maturation of the frontal lobes, which develop speedily over the preschool period. To fully understand the development of EF in preschoolers, this study examined the relationship among the three domains of executive function (cognitive shifting, inhibitory control, and working memory) to test the applicability of the unity&amp;amp;ndash;diversity model in preschoolers using both behavioral and fNIRS approaches. Altogether, 58 Chinese preschoolers (34 boys, 24 girls, Mage = 5.86 years, SD = 0.53, age range = 4.83&amp;amp;ndash;6.67 years) were administered the Dimensional Card Change Sort (DCCS), go/no-go, and missing scan task. Their brain activations in the prefrontal cortex during the tasks were examined using fNIRS. First, the behavioral results indicated that the missing scan task scores (working memory) correlated with the DCCS (cognitive shifting) and go/no-go tasks (inhibitory control). However, the latter two did not correlate with each other. Second, the fNIRS results demonstrated that the prefrontal activations during the working memory task correlated with those in the same regions during the cognitive shifting and inhibitory control tasks. However, the latter two still did not correlate. The behavioral and neuroimaging evidence jointly indicates that the unity&amp;amp;ndash;diversity model of EF does apply to Chinese preschoolers.</p>

	<p>The development of immunosuppressants has been key for the advancement of solid organ transplant surgery. Specifically, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or everolimus have significantly increased the survival rate of patients by reducing the risk of a rejection of the transplanted organ and limiting graft-versus-host disease. We report the case of a 65-year-old man who, after undergoing a liver transplantation and receiving an immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine and everolimus, presented severe obsessive, psychotic, and behavioral symptoms over the past three years, and describe the pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions implemented against these symptoms. In this case, the immunosuppressants used have been cyclosporine and, preferably, everolimus. On the other hand, potential adverse reactions to the treatment have been observed, including neuropsychiatric symptoms such as tremor, anxiety, dysthymia, psychosis, and behavioral disorders, which make it necessary to use corrective psychoactive drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, combined with non-pharmacological interventions. A transversal approach, from the medical and psychosocial disciplines, facilitates success in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms after soft organ transplants.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Data-Driven Models of Efficient Chromatic Coding in the Outer Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent experimental work on zebrafish has shown the <I>in vivo</I> activity of photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) as a function of the stimulus spectrum, highlighting the appearance of chromatic-opponent signals at their first synaptic connection. Altogether with the observed lack of excitatory intercone connections, these findings suggest that the mechanism yielding early color opponency in zebrafish is dominated by inhibitory feedback. We propose a neuronal population model based on zebrafish retinal circuitry to investigate whether networks with predominantly inhibitory feedback are more advantageous in encoding chromatic information than networks with mixed excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. We show that networks with dominant inhibitory feedback exhibit a unique and reliable encoding of chromatic information. In contrast, this property is not guaranteed in networks with strong excitatory intercone connections, exhibiting bistability. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for the absence of excitatory intercone couplings in zebrafish color circuits. In addition, our study shows that these networks, with only one type of horizontal cell, are suitable to encode most of the variance from the zebrafish environment. However, at least two successive layers of inhibitory neurons are needed to reach the optimum. Finally, we contrast the encoding performance of networks with different opsin sensitivities, showing an improvement of only 13% compared with zebrafish, suggesting that the zebrafish retina is adapted to encode color information from its habitat efficiently.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Modes of Action of {alpha}1- and {alpha}1{gamma}2-Autoantibodies Derived from Patients with GABAAR Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autoantibodies against central nervous system proteins are increasingly being recognized in association with neurologic disorders. Although a growing number of neural autoantibodies have been identified, a causal link between specific autoantibodies and disease symptoms remains unclear, as most studies use patient-derived CSF-containing mixtures of autoantibodies. This raises questions concerning mechanism of action and which autoantibodies truly contribute to disease progression. To address this issue, monoclonal autoantibodies were isolated from a young girl with a range of neurologic symptoms, some of which reacted with specific GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) subunits, &alpha;1-subunit and &alpha;12-subunit, which in this study we have characterized in detail using a combination of cellular imaging and electrophysiological techniques. These studies in neurons from wild-type mice (C57BL/6J; RRID:<A HREF="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</A>) of mixed-sex revealed that the &alpha;1 and &alpha;12 subunit-specific antibodies have differential effects on the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor. Namely, the &alpha;1-antibody was found to directly affect GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor function on a short time scale that diminished GABA currents, leading to increased network excitability. On longer time scales those antibodies also triggered a redistribution of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor away from synapses. In contrast, the &alpha;12-antibody had no direct effect on GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor function and could possibly mediate its effect through other actors of the immune system. Taken together, these data highlight the complexity underlying autoimmune disorders and show that antibodies can exert their effect through many mechanisms within the same disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein levels in rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis: A promising biomarker [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the early stages of the disease, some of the signs and symptoms of joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may resemble that of spondyloarthritis (SpA). An examination that can help distinguish RA and SpA is warranted. One such examination is the measurement of serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) levels. This study aimed to measure serum LRG levels in RA and SpA patients and determine the role of LRG in the diagnosis of RA and SpA. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study consisting of 26 RA subjects and 26 SpA subjects. The SpA subjects were further grouped into ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and peripheral SpA. Measurement of serum LRG levels were conducted using ELISA. Difference between LRG levels of the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: LRG levels were elevated in 76.9% and 84.6% of subjects with RA and SpA, respectively. The median LRG levels were higher in RA subjects (77.03 (27.16–107.73)) than SpA (68.67 (33.15–115.18)). There was no significant difference in LRG levels in RA and SpA subjects (p = .442). The RA and PsA group were predominated by diseases of moderate activity, 88.5% and 58.3%, respectively. In comparison, AS was dominated by high disease activity (85.7%). The highest median LRG levels in AR and SpA subjects were in new-onset patients (82.21 vs. 72.25 µg/dL). Conclusions: There was no significant difference in LRG levels between RA and SpA subjects. The role of LRG in the diagnosis of RA and SpA remains to be determined in future studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Agent-based modelling for the study of shipwreck site formation processes: A theoretical framework and conceptual model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Shipwreck site formation processes (SFP), their dynamics and transformation have long interested maritime archaeology from both a historical perspective and heritage management since shipwrecks constitute endangered cultural sites. Major contributions to shipwreck SFP have been made since the 1970s which conceive SFP from a systemic theoretical perspective, notably those of Keith Muckelroy and Martin Gibbs. However, to our view, such a perspective falls short in its capacity to explain and predict the distribution of elements in a shipwreck. In this article, we propose that shipwreck SFP can be understood from the theoretical framework of complex adaptive systems (CAS), where a SFP constitutes a CAS in which nonlinear interactions of natural and cultural factors give rise to the observed seabed distribution of a shipwreck as an emergent phenomenon. Methods From this theoretical framework, we propose agent-based modelling (ABM) as a suitable methodological approach for studying SFP. We show its implementation using the USS Somers, a 19th-century brig of war that sank in 1846 off the port of Veracruz, Mexico, during the Mexican-American War as a case study. The conceptual model was developed from the integration of historical data about the ship’s nautical characteristics and operation, information on the wrecking event from eyewitnesses, as well as modern environmental data. Results We present a conceptual model defining various elements that would constitute the Somers’ ABM. It gives specifics about the characteristics and variables regarding agents, global variables, processes, indicators, degradation and deposition sequences, and user interface. Conclusion The conceptual model served to develop ABM in a simulation platform where historical hypotheses can be tested and various possible scenarios of the SFP can be explored. By contrasting the simulation results with the archaeological record of the shipwreck, ABM would allow maritime archaeologists to postulate more supported and refined interpretations of a shipwreck’s SFP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smartphone use and social media addiction in undergraduate students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Children’s use of social media has increased significantly over the past decade. As a result, they are susceptible to smartphone addiction. In particular, parents' and children's well-being and behaviors are negatively affected by smartphone addiction. Such addiction likely affects both physical performance and lifestyle. Adolescents utilize their smartphones while performing other tasks. The secondary task might divert attention away from the primary task. Reaction time is the combination of brain processing and muscular movement. Texting or communicating on a smartphone while performing another task may affect reaction time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of smartphone use on reaction time in undergraduate students who were addicted to smartphones. Methods: The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) was used to assign 64 undergraduate students to the smartphone addiction group (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). The reaction time (RT) of an organism is used to determine how rapidly it responds to stimuli. All participants were examined on the RT test under three conditions: no smartphone use (control), texting, and chatting on a smartphone. Participants were questioned by smartphone through text message or chat with the support of a researcher during the texting and conversation conditions. While responding to the questions, the participant was administered an RT test. Results: The results showed that smartphone addiction tends to have a reduced influence on reaction time when compared to the control group. Also, texting or conversing on a smartphone while doing other work had a substantial impact on reaction time in the undergraduates. Conclusions: Combining smartphone use with other activities tends to reduce undergraduate students' reaction time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Genome-wide identification and characterization of DNA enhancers with a stacked multivariate fusion framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yansong Wang, Zilong Hou, Yuning Yang, Ka-chun Wong, Xiangtao Li</p>

Enhancers are short non-coding DNA sequences outside of the target promoter regions that can be bound by specific proteins to increase a gene’s transcriptional activity, which has a crucial role in the spatiotemporal and quantitative regulation of gene expression. However, enhancers do not have a specific sequence motifs or structures, and their scattered distribution in the genome makes the identification of enhancers from human cell lines particularly challenging. Here we present a novel, stacked multivariate fusion framework called SMFM, which enables a comprehensive identification and analysis of enhancers from regulatory DNA sequences as well as their interpretation. Specifically, to characterize the hierarchical relationships of enhancer sequences, multi-source biological information and dynamic semantic information are fused to represent regulatory DNA enhancer sequences. Then, we implement a deep learning–based sequence network to learn the feature representation of the enhancer sequences comprehensively and to extract the implicit relationships in the dynamic semantic information. Ultimately, an ensemble machine learning classifier is trained based on the refined multi-source features and dynamic implicit relations obtained from the deep learning-based sequence network. Benchmarking experiments demonstrated that SMFM significantly outperforms other existing methods using several evaluation metrics. In addition, an independent test set was used to validate the generalization performance of SMFM by comparing it to other state-of-the-art enhancer identification methods. Moreover, we performed motif analysis based on the contribution scores of different bases of enhancer sequences to the final identification results. Besides, we conducted interpretability analysis of the identified enhancer sequences based on attention weights of EnhancerBERT, a fine-tuned BERT model that provides new insights into exploring the gene semantic information likely to underlie the discovered enhancers in an interpretable manner. Finally, in a human placenta study with 4,562 active distal gene regulatory enhancers, SMFM successfully exposed tissue-related placental development and the differential mechanism, demonstrating the generalizability and stability of our proposed framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Recalibrating probabilistic forecasts of epidemics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aaron Rumack, Ryan J. Tibshirani, Roni Rosenfeld</p>

Distributional forecasts are important for a wide variety of applications, including forecasting epidemics. Often, forecasts are miscalibrated, or unreliable in assigning uncertainty to future events. We present a recalibration method that can be applied to a black-box forecaster given retrospective forecasts and observations, as well as an extension to make this method more effective in recalibrating epidemic forecasts. This method is guaranteed to improve calibration and log score performance when trained and measured in-sample. We also prove that the increase in expected log score of a recalibrated forecaster is equal to the entropy of the PIT distribution. We apply this recalibration method to the 27 influenza forecasters in the FluSight Network and show that recalibration reliably improves forecast accuracy and calibration. This method, available on Github, is effective, robust, and easy to use as a post-processing tool to improve epidemic forecasts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using smartphone-GPS data to quantify human activity in green spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alessandro Filazzola, Garland Xie, Kimberly Barrett, Andrea Dunn, Marc T. J. Johnson, James Scott MacIvor</p>

Cities are growing in density and coverage globally, increasing the value of green spaces for human health and well-being. Understanding the interactions between people and green spaces is also critical for biological conservation and sustainable development. However, quantifying green space use is particularly challenging. We used an activity index of anonymized GPS data from smart devices provided by Mapbox (www.mapbox.com) to characterize human activity in green spaces in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. The goals of our study were to describe i) a methodological example of how anonymized GPS data could be used for human-nature research and ii) associations between park features and human activity. We describe some of the challenges and solutions with using this activity index, especially in the context of green spaces and biodiversity monitoring. We found the activity index was strongly correlated with visitation records (i.e., park reservations) and that these data are useful to identify high or low-usage areas within green spaces. Parks with a more extensive trail network typically experienced higher visitation rates and a substantial proportion of activity remained on trails. We identified certain land covers that were more frequently associated with human presence, such as rock formations, and find a relationship between human activity and tree composition. Our study demonstrates that anonymized GPS data from smart devices are a powerful tool for spatially quantifying human activity in green spaces. These could help to minimize trade-offs in the management of green spaces for human use and biological conservation will continue to be a significant challenge over the coming decades because of accelerating urbanization coupled with population growth. Importantly, we include a series of recommendations when using activity indexes for managing green spaces that can assist with biomonitoring and supporting sustainable human use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Eleven quick tips for data cleaning and feature engineering</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davide Chicco, Luca Oneto, Erica Tavazzi</p>

Applying computational statistics or machine learning methods to data is a key component of many scientific studies, in any field, but alone might not be sufficient to generate robust and reliable outcomes and results. Before applying any discovery method, preprocessing steps are necessary to prepare the data to the computational analysis. In this framework, data cleaning and feature engineering are key pillars of any scientific study involving data analysis and that should be adequately designed and performed since the first phases of the project. We call “feature” a variable describing a particular trait of a person or an observation, recorded usually as a column in a dataset. Even if pivotal, these data cleaning and feature engineering steps sometimes are done poorly or inefficiently, especially by beginners and unexperienced researchers. For this reason, we propose here our quick tips for data cleaning and feature engineering on how to carry out these important preprocessing steps correctly avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls. Although we designed these guidelines with bioinformatics and health informatics scenarios in mind, we believe they can more in general be applied to any scientific area. We therefore target these guidelines to any researcher or practitioners wanting to perform data cleaning or feature engineering. We believe our simple recommendations can help researchers and scholars perform better computational analyses that can lead, in turn, to more solid outcomes and more reliable discoveries.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic comparison of modeling fidelity levels and parameter inference settings applied to negative feedback gene regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrien Coulier, Prashant Singh, Marc Sturrock, Andreas Hellander</p>

Quantitative stochastic models of gene regulatory networks are important tools for studying cellular regulation. Such models can be formulated at many different levels of fidelity. A practical challenge is to determine what model fidelity to use in order to get accurate and representative results. The choice is important, because models of successively higher fidelity come at a rapidly increasing computational cost. In some situations, the level of detail is clearly motivated by the question under study. In many situations however, many model options could qualitatively agree with available data, depending on the amount of data and the nature of the observations. Here, an important distinction is whether we are interested in inferring the true (but unknown) physical parameters of the model or if it is sufficient to be able to capture and explain available data. The situation becomes complicated from a computational perspective because inference needs to be approximate. Most often it is based on likelihood-free Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and here determining which summary statistics to use, as well as how much data is needed to reach the desired level of accuracy, are difficult tasks. Ultimately, all of these aspects—the model fidelity, the available data, and the numerical choices for inference—interplay in a complex manner. In this paper we develop a computational pipeline designed to systematically evaluate inference accuracy for a wide range of true known parameters. We then use it to explore inference settings for negative feedback gene regulation. In particular, we compare a detailed spatial stochastic model, a coarse-grained compartment-based multiscale model, and the standard well-mixed model, across several data-scenarios and for multiple numerical options for parameter inference. Practically speaking, this pipeline can be used as a preliminary step to guide modelers prior to gathering experimental data. By training Gaussian processes to approximate the distance function values, we are able to substantially reduce the computational cost of running the pipeline.

Failure is an integral part of life and by extension academia. At the same time, failure is often ignored, with potentially negative consequences both for the science and the scientists involved. This article provides several strategies for learning from and dealing with failure instead of ignoring it. Hopefully, our recommendations are widely applicable, while still taking into account individual differences between academics. These simple rules allow academics to further develop their own strategies for failing successfully in academia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of genetic variants of the industrial yeast Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) that contribute to increased yields of secreted heterologous proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin Offei, Stephanie Braun-Galleani, Anjan Venkatesh, William T. Casey, Kevin E. O’Connor, Kevin P. Byrne, Kenneth H. Wolfe</p>

The yeast <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> (formerly called <i>Pichia pastoris</i>) is used widely as a host for secretion of heterologous proteins, but only a few isolates of this species exist and all the commonly used expression systems are derived from a single genetic background, CBS7435 (NRRL Y-11430). We hypothesized that other genetic backgrounds could harbor variants that affect yields of secreted proteins. We crossed CBS7435 with 2 other <i>K</i>. <i>phaffii</i> isolates and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for secretion of a heterologous protein, β-glucosidase, by sequencing individual segregant genomes. A major QTL mapped to a frameshift mutation in the mannosyltransferase gene <i>HOC1</i>, which gives CBS7435 a weaker cell wall and higher protein secretion than the other isolates. Inactivation of <i>HOC1</i> in the other isolates doubled β-glucosidase secretion. A second QTL mapped to an amino acid substitution in <i>IRA1</i> that tripled β-glucosidase secretion in 1-week batch cultures but reduced cell viability, and its effects are specific to this heterologous protein. Our results demonstrate that QTL analysis is a powerful method for dissecting the basis of biotechnological traits in nonconventional yeasts, and a route to improving their industrial performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Integrated neural dynamics of sensorimotor decisions and actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Thura, Jean-François Cabana, Albert Feghaly, Paul Cisek</p>

Recent theoretical models suggest that deciding about actions and executing them are not implemented by completely distinct neural mechanisms but are instead two modes of an integrated dynamical system. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining how neural activity unfolds during a dynamic decision-making task within the high-dimensional space defined by the activity of cells in monkey dorsal premotor (PMd), primary motor (M1), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GPe, GPi). Dimensionality reduction shows that the four strongest components of neural activity are functionally interpretable, reflecting a state transition between deliberation and commitment, the transformation of sensory evidence into a choice, and the baseline and slope of the rising urgency to decide. Analysis of the contribution of each population to these components shows meaningful differences between regions but no distinct clusters within each region, consistent with an integrated dynamical system. During deliberation, cortical activity unfolds on a two-dimensional “decision manifold” defined by sensory evidence and urgency and falls off this manifold at the moment of commitment into a choice-dependent trajectory leading to movement initiation. The structure of the manifold varies between regions: In PMd, it is curved; in M1, it is nearly perfectly flat; and in dlPFC, it is almost entirely confined to the sensory evidence dimension. In contrast, pallidal activity during deliberation is primarily defined by urgency. We suggest that these findings reveal the distinct functional contributions of different brain regions to an integrated dynamical system governing action selection and execution.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Age‐related effects on the anterior and posterior hippocampal volumes in 6–21 year olds: A model selection approach</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although recent studies support significant differences in intrinsic structure, function, and connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, few studies have investigated the normative development of this dimension. In addition, factors known to influence hippocampal structure, such as sex or puberty, have yet to be characterized when assessing age-related effects on its subregions. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relationship of the anterior (antHC) and posterior (postHC) hippocampus volumes with age, and how these are moderated by sex or puberty, in structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 183 typically developing participants aged 6–21 years. Based on previous literature, we first anticipated that non-linear models would best represent the relationship between age and the antHC and postHC volumes. We found that age-related effects are region-specific, such that the antHC volume remains stable with increasing age, while the postHC shows a cubic function characterized by overall volume increase with age but a slower rate during adolescence. Second, we hypothesized that models, which include biological sex or pubertal status would best describe these relationships. Contrary to expectation, models comprising either biological sex or pubertal status did not significantly improve model performance. Further longitudinal research is needed to evaluate their effects on the antHC and postHC development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Place cells are nonrandomly clustered by field location in CA1 hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A challenge in both modern and historic neuroscience has been achieving an understanding of neuron circuits, and determining the computational and organizational principles that underlie these circuits. Deeper understanding of the organization of brain circuits and cell types, including in the hippocampus, is required for advances in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, as well as for understanding principles governing brain development and evolution. In this manuscript, we pioneer a new method to analyze the spatial clustering of active neurons in the hippocampus. We use calcium imaging and a rewarded navigation task to record from 100 s of place cells in the CA1 of freely moving rats. We then use statistical techniques developed for and in widespread use in geographic mapping studies, global Moran's I, and local Moran's I to demonstrate that cells that code for similar spatial locations tend to form small spatial clusters. We present evidence that this clustering is not the result of artifacts from calcium imaging, and show that these clusters are primarily formed by cells that have place fields around previously rewarded locations. We go on to show that, although cells with similar place fields tend to form clusters, there is no obvious topographic mapping of environmental location onto the hippocampus, such as seen in the visual cortex. Insights into hippocampal organization, as in this study, can elucidate mechanisms underlying motivational behaviors, spatial navigation, and memory formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The COVID-19 pandemic and mental health outcomes – A cross-sectional study among health care workers in Coastal South India [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1st March -30th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged > 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p>0.05) Conclusions:  Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SnakeMAGs: a simple, efficient, flexible and scalable workflow to reconstruct prokaryotic genomes from metagenomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the last decade, we have observed in microbial ecology a transition from gene-centric to genome-centric analyses. Indeed, the advent of metagenomics combined with binning methods, single-cell genome sequencing as well as high-throughput cultivation methods have contributed to the continuing and exponential increase of available prokaryotic genomes, which in turn has favored the exploration of microbial metabolisms. In the case of metagenomics, data processing, from raw reads to genome reconstruction, involves various steps and software which can represent a major technical obstacle. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we developed SnakeMAGs, a simple workflow that can process Illumina data, from raw reads to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) classification and relative abundance estimate. It integrates state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools to sequentially perform: quality control of the reads (illumina-utils, Trimmomatic), host sequence removal (optional step, using Bowtie2), assembly (MEGAHIT), binning (MetaBAT2), quality filtering of the bins (CheckM), classification of the MAGs (GTDB-Tk) and estimate of their relative abundance (CoverM). Developed with the popular Snakemake workflow management system, it can be deployed on various architectures, from single to multicore and from workstation to computer clusters and grids. It is also flexible since users can easily change parameters and/or add new rules. Results: Using termite gut metagenomic datasets, we showed that SnakeMAGs is slower but allowed the recovery of more MAGs encompassing more diverse phyla compared to another similar workflow named ATLAS. Conclusions: Overall, it should make the reconstruction of MAGs more accessible to microbiologists. SnakeMAGs as well as test files and an extended tutorial are available at https://github.com/Nachida08/SnakeMAGs.

                Background: This study aims to determine the factors affecting HBV DNA suppression in chronic hepatitis B patients with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Methods: A case-control was carried out from October 2021 to August 2022 on 182 chronic hepatitis B patients who had TDF therapy regularly for 24 weeks at H. Adam Malik and USU Hospitals in Medan, Indonesia. The history of the samples was obtained, followed by physical examination, and blood collection. CTLA-4 polymorphism examination was carried out using real-time PCR, while the serum CTLA-4 levels were assessed with ELISA. Results: The results showed that CTLA-4, HBV DNA, ALT, and CTLA-4 -1661G>A polymorphisms have a relationship with HBV DNA suppression in chronic hepatitis B patients with TDF. Conclusions: The levels of CTLA-4, HBV DNA, ALT, and CTLA-4 -1661G>A polymorphism have a potential relationship with the suppression of HBV DNA in chronic hepatitis B patients with TDF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico and in vitro analysis of THCA synthase gene in Moroccan Cannabis sativa, L [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis ( Cannabis sativa, L.) is an archaic, most infamous plant with unique therapeutic characteristics, and great economic interest. The identification of its THCAS synthesizing enzyme was a great leap forward in Cannabis investigation. However, basic molecular biology for THCAS gene expression remains largely unstudied. In this paper, we explored the ability of bioinformatics resources in the design of molecular cloning protocol and prediction of three-dimensional structure of recombinant THCAS in Moroccan Cannabis sativa variety. Methods:  We described conventional experiments performed in vitro. We used specific primers to isolate the nucleotide sequence of THCAS from the leaves of Cannabis, without including the native signal sequence.we prepared the gene by amors containing specific adapters to integrate the gene into the expression vector PpinkαHC, transforming E.coli bacteria, in order to express the gene in Pichia pasteri yeast. Results: As a result, we found high sequence similarity with THCAS and the mRNA precursor of the same gene as previously reported. In addition, we predicted the structure of the recombinant THCAS using the organic crystal structure prediction method, the amino acid sequence reference, and the artificial intelligence technology. Conclusions: In this study, we have successfuly cloned recombinant THCAS enzyme in E.Coli for further expression in host Pichia pastori.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory glomeruli are the sites of initial synaptic integration in olfactory information processing. They are surrounded by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, which include periglomerular, superficial short axon, and external tufted cells. A subpopulation of JG cells expresses the dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and aromatic <span class="smallCaps">l</span>-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). TH cells corelease γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their processes extend to multiple glomeruli forming intra- and interglomerular circuits. It is well established that 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts wide ranging effects in the central nervous system. However, participation of E2 in the modulation of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity of TH cells in olfactory glomeruli is unknown. To address this, we subcutaneously implanted a 60-day release pellet of E2 or placebo into intact male mice and compared glomerular TH, AADC, and vesicular γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT) immunoreactivity between them. High-voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) and ultra-HVEM using immunogold revealed significantly increased immunoreactive intensity at the cellular level for TH and AADC after E2 treatment and for VGAT in TH cells. These results indicate that E2 may affect the interplay between dopaminergic and GABAergic systems. Moreover, random-section electron microscopy analysis showed a significant increase in the number of symmetrical synapses from TH cell to mitral/tufted cell dendrites after E2 treatment. This result was supported by quantitative immunofluorescence staining with synapse markers. Together, these data indicate that E2 may regulate inhibition between TH cells and olfactory bulb neurons within the glomerulus via interaction between dopaminergic and GABAergic systems, thereby contributing to neuromodulation of odor information processing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The sensory nervous system is critical to maintain cardiac function. As opposed to efferent innervation, less is known about cardiac afferents. For this, we mapped the VGLUT2-expressing cardiac afferent fibers of spinal and vagal origin by using the VGLUT2::tdTomato double transgenic mouse as an approach to visualize the whole hearts both at the dorsal and ventral sides. For comparison, we colabeled mixed-sex transgenic hearts with either TUJ1 protein for global cardiac innervation or tyrosine hydroxylase for the sympathetic network at the healthy state or following ischemic injury. Interestingly, the nerve density for global and VGLUT2-expressing afferents was found significantly higher on the dorsal side compared to the ventral side. From the global nerve innervation detected by TUJ1 immunoreactivity, VGLUT2 afferent innervation was detected to be 15–25% of the total network. The detailed characterization of both the atria and the ventricles revealed a remarkable diversity of spinal afferent nerve ending morphologies of flower sprays, intramuscular endings, and end-net branches that innervate distinct anatomical parts of the heart. Using this integrative approach in a chronic myocardial infarct model, we showed a significant increase in hyperinnervation in the form of axonal sprouts for cardiac afferents at the infarct border zone, as well as denervation at distal sites of the ischemic area. The functional and physiological consequences of the abnormal sensory innervation remodeling post-ischemic injury should be further evaluated in future studies regarding their potential contribution to cardiac dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A circular zone of attachment to the extracellular matrix provides directionality to the motility of Toxoplasma gondii in 3D</a></h4>

              
                <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a protozoan parasite that infects 30-40% of the world's population. Infections are typically subclinical but can be severe and, in some cases, life threatening. Central to the virulence of <i>T. gondii</i> is an unusual form of substrate-dependent motility that enables the parasite to invade cells of its host and to disseminate throughout the body. A hetero-oligomeric complex of proteins that functions in motility has been characterized, but how these proteins work together to drive forward motion of the parasite remains controversial. A key piece of information needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) is the directionality of the forces that a moving parasite exerts on the external environment. The linear motor model of motility, which has dominated the field for the past two decades, predicts continuous anterior-to-posterior force generation along the length of the parasite. We show here using three-dimensional traction force mapping that the predominant forces exerted by a moving parasite are instead periodic and directed in towards the parasite at a fixed circular location within the extracellular matrix. These highly localized forces, which are generated by the parasite pulling on the matrix, create a visible constriction in the parasite’s plasma membrane. We propose that the ring of inward-directed force corresponds to a circumferential attachment zone between the parasite and the matrix, through which the parasite propels itself to move forward. The combined data suggest a closer connection between the mechanisms underlying parasite motility and host cell invasion than previously recognized. In parasites lacking the major surface adhesin, TgMIC2, neither the inward-directed forces nor the constriction of the parasite membrane are observed. The trajectories of the TgMIC2-deficient parasites are less straight than those of wild-type parasites, suggesting that the annular zone of TgMIC2-mediated attachment to the extracellular matrix normally constrains the directional options available to the parasite as it migrates through its surrounding environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automated hippocampal unfolding for morphometry and subfield segmentation with HippUnfold</a></h4>

              
                Like neocortical structures, the archicortical hippocampus differs in its folding patterns across individuals. Here, we present an automated and robust BIDS-App, HippUnfold, for defining and indexing individual-specific hippocampal folding in MRI, analogous to popular tools used in neocortical reconstruction. Such tailoring is critical for inter-individual alignment, with topology serving as the basis for homology. This topological framework enables qualitatively new analyses of morphological and laminar structure in the hippocampus or its subfields. It is critical for refining current neuroimaging analyses at a meso- as well as micro-scale. HippUnfold uses state-of-the-art deep learning combined with previously developed topological constraints to generate uniquely folded surfaces to fit a given subject's hippocampal conformation. It is designed to work with commonly employed sub-millimetric MRI acquisitions, with possible extension to microscopic resolution. In this paper we describe the power of HippUnfold in feature extraction, and highlight its unique value compared to several extant hippocampal subfield analysis methods.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A selective LIS1 requirement for mitotic spindle assembly discriminates distinct T-cell division mechanisms within the T-cell lineage</a></h4>

              
                The ability to proliferate is a common feature of most T-cell populations. However, proliferation follows different cell-cycle dynamics and is coupled to different functional outcomes according to T-cell subsets. Whether the mitotic machineries supporting these qualitatively distinct proliferative responses are identical remains unknown. Here, we show that disruption of the microtubule-associated protein LIS1 in mouse models leads to proliferative defects associated with a blockade of T-cell development after b-selection and of peripheral CD4+ T cell expansion after antigen priming. In contrast, cell divisions in CD8+ T cells occurred independently of LIS1 following T-cell antigen receptor stimulation, although LIS1 was required for proliferation elicited by pharmacological activation. In thymocytes and CD4+ T cells, LIS1-deficiency did not affect signaling events leading to activation but led to an interruption of proliferation after the initial round of division and to p53-induced cell death. Proliferative defects resulted from a mitotic failure, characterized by the presence of extra-centrosomes and the formation of multipolar spindles, causing abnormal chromosomes congression during metaphase and separation during telophase. LIS1 was required to stabilize dynein/dynactin complexes, which promote chromosome attachment to mitotic spindles and ensure centrosome integrity. Together, these results suggest that proliferative responses are supported by distinct mitotic machineries across T-cell subsets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-guided isoform identification for the human transcriptome</a></h4>

              
                Recently-developed methods to predict three-dimensional protein structure with high accuracy have opened new avenues for genome and proteome research. We explore a new hypothesis in genome annotation, namely whether computationally predicted structures can help to identify which of multiple possible gene isoforms represents a functional protein product. Guided by protein structure predictions, we evaluated over 230,000 isoforms of human protein-coding genes assembled from over 10,000 RNA sequencing experiments across many human tissues. From this set of assembled transcripts, we identified hundreds of isoforms with more confidently predicted structure and potentially superior function in comparison to canonical isoforms in the latest human gene database. We illustrate our new method with examples where structure provides a guide to function in combination with expression and evolutionary evidence. Additionally, we provide the complete set of structures as a resource to better understand the function of human genes and their isoforms. These results demonstrate the promise of protein structure prediction as a genome annotation tool, allowing us to refine even the most highly-curated catalog of human proteins. More generally we demonstrate a practical, structure-guided approach that can be used to enhance the annotation of any genome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural representations of naturalistic events are updated as our understanding of the past changes</a></h4>

              
                The brain actively reshapes our understanding of past events in light of new incoming information. In the current study, we ask how the brain supports this updating process during the encoding and recall of naturalistic stimuli. One group of participants watched a movie ('The Sixth Sense') with a cinematic 'twist' at the end that dramatically changed the interpretation of previous events. Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new 'twist' information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating. Our results demonstrate that neural representations of past events encoded in the DMN are dynamically integrated with new information that reshapes our understanding in natural contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Prevalent and dynamic binding of the cell cycle checkpoint kinase Rad53 to gene promoters</a></h4>

              
                Replication of the genome must be coordinated with gene transcription and cellular metabolism, especially following replication stress in the presence of limiting deoxyribonucleotides. The <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Rad53 (CHEK2 in mammals) checkpoint kinase plays a major role in cellular responses to DNA replication stress. Cell cycle regulated, genome-wide binding of Rad53 to chromatin was examined. Under replication stress, the kinase bound to sites of active DNA replication initiation and fork progression, but unexpectedly to the promoters of about 20% of genes encoding proteins involved in multiple cellular functions. Rad53 promoter binding correlated with changes in expression of a subset of genes. Rad53 promoter binding to certain genes was influenced by sequence-specific transcription factors and less by checkpoint signaling. However, in checkpoint mutants, untimely activation of late-replicating origins reduces the transcription of nearby genes, with concomitant localization of Rad53 to their gene bodies. We suggest that the Rad53 checkpoint kinase coordinates genome-wide replication and transcription under replication stress conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parahippocampal neurons encode task-relevant information for goal-directed navigation</a></h4>

              
                A behavioral strategy crucial to survival is directed navigation to a goal, such as a food or home location. One potential neural substrate for supporting goal-directed navigation is the parahippocampus, which contains neurons that represent an animals position, orientation, and movement through the world, and that change their firing activity to encode behaviorally relevant variables such as reward. However, little prior work on the parahippocampus has considered how neurons encode variables during goal-directed navigation in environments that dynamically change. Here, we recorded single units from rat parahippocampal cortex while subjects performed a goal-directed task. The maze dynamically changed goal-locations via a visual cue on a trial-to-trial basis, requiring subjects to use cue-location associations to receive reward. We observed a mismatch-like signal, with elevated neural activity on incorrect trials, leading to rate-remapping. The strength of this remapping correlated with task performance. Recordings during open-field foraging allowed us to functionally define navigational coding for a subset of the neurons recorded in the maze. This approach revealed that head-direction coding units remapped more than other functional-defined units. Taken together, this work thus raises the possibility that during goal-directed navigation, parahippocampal neurons encode error information reflective of an animals behavioral performance.

                We lack a fundamental understanding of how the spike output of the retina enables human visual perception. Here we show that human vision at its ultimate sensitivity limit depends on the spike output of ON but not OFF parasol (magnocellular) ganglion cells. Surprisingly, nonlinear signal processing in the retinal ON pathway precludes perceptual detection of single photons in darkness, but enables quantal-resolution discrimination of differences in light intensity.

                Grid cell impairments and path integration deficits are sensitive markers of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging evidence from human and rodent studies suggest that disrupted grid coding underlies path integration deficits in preclinical individuals. However, it still remains unclear if disrupted early AD grid coding reflects increased noise across the network or a specific deficit in path integration, perhaps via an impairment in the integration of self-motion cues. Here, we report in the J20 transgenic amyloid beta mouse model of early AD that grid cells were spatially unstable towards the center of the square arena but not near the borders, had qualitatively different spatial components that aligned parallel to the borders of the environment, and exhibited impaired integration of distance travelled via reduced theta phase precession. Our results suggest that disrupted early AD grid coding reflects reduced integration of self-motion cues but not environmental landmarks, providing further evidence that grid cell impairments underlie specific path integration deficits in early AD.

                Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows monitoring the progression of amyloid aggregation in the living brain. [18F]-Flortaucipir is the only approved PET tracer compound for the visualisation of tau aggregation. Here, we describe cryo-EM experiments on tau filaments in the presence and absence of flortaucipir. We used tau filaments isolated from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and from the brain of an individual with primary age-related tauopathy (PART) with a co-pathology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Unexpectedly, we were unable to visualise additional cryo-EM density for flortaucipir for AD paired helical or straight filaments (PHFs or SFs), but we did observe density for flortaucipir binding to CTE Type I filaments from the case with PART. In the latter, flortaucipir binds in a 1:1 molecular stoichiometry with tau, adjacent to lysine 353 and aspartate 358. By adopting a tilted geometry with respect to the helical axis, the 4.7 A distance between neighbouring tau monomers is reconciled with the 3.5 A distance consistent with pi-pi-stacking between neighbouring molecules of flortaucipir.

                Two major issues in consciousness research concern the measuring methods that determine per-ceptual unawareness and whether consciousness is a gradual or an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon. This 7T fMRI study addresses both questions using a continuous flash suppression paradigm with an emotional recognition task (fear vs neutral bodies) in combination with the perceptual awareness scale. Behaviorally, recognition sensitivity increased linearly with increased stimuli awareness and was at chance level during perceptual unawareness. Threat expressions triggered a slower heart rate than neutral ones during "almost clear" experience of the stimulus, indicating freezing behavior. The activity in occipital, temporal, parietal and frontal regions as well as in amygdala increased with increased stimulus awareness while the activity in early visual areas showed the opposite pattern. The relationship between temporal area activity and perceptual awareness was better characterized by a gradual model while the activity in fronto-parietal areas by a dichotomous model, suggesting different roles in conscious processing. Interestingly, no evidence of non-conscious processing was found in amygdala as well as no significant effect of emotion, in disagreement with the functions long ascribed to this subcortical structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A differential effect for tau isoforms and mutants in decreasing the stability of Arc</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau, a main component of neurofibrillary tangles. Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of secondary tauopathy. While stabilizing microtubules is a well-established role for tau, tau is also localized at postsynaptic sites and can disrupt synaptic plasticity when knocked out or overexpressed. A major gap in understanding tau functions is identifying the intracellular mechanisms through which tau modulates synaptic function. Here, we found that overexpression of the 0N4R isoform of tau in HEK 293 cells decreased the stability of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), an immediate early gene that plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Importantly, tau-induced Arc degradation was found to be isoform-specific in that overexpression of the 0N3R tau isoform had no effect. Tau-dependent reduction of Arc required proteasome activity, yet was independent of Arc ubiquitination. Surprisingly, tau-induced Arc removal required the endophilin-binding domain of Arc. Overexpression of 0N4R tau in primary hippocampal neurons led to Arc instability exclusively in neuronal dendrites, which was coupled to increases in the expression of dendritic and somatic surface GluA1-containing AMPA receptors. Interestingly, these effects on Arc stability and GluA1 localization were not observed in the commonly studied tau mutant, P301L. Our findings implicate isoform- and domain-specific effects of tau in regulating Arc stability and AMPA receptor targeting, which may in part explain the deficits in synaptic plasticity that are observed in select types of tauopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Is mild ADHD beneficial: Brain criticality is maximal with moderate ADHD symptom scores</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by involuntary fluctuations of attention in continuous performance tasks (CPTs) wherein attention must be sustained over long periods of time. The neuronal basis underlying aberrant attentional fluctuations in time scales from seconds to minutes have remained poorly understood. Neuronal alpha- and gamma-band oscillations are thought to implement attentional and top-down control of sensorimotor processing. We hypothesized that aberrant behavioral fluctuations in ADHD would be caused by aberrant endogenous brain dynamics in alpha and gamma-band oscillations and specifically by their aberrant long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). We measured brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) from adult participants diagnosed with ADHD (N = 19) and from healthy control subjects (N = 20) during resting state and two CPTs; a threshold stimulus detection task and a Go/NoGo task. We then estimated LRTCs of neuronal oscillations and behavioral fluctuations with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). ADHD was associated with aberrant LRTCs in both behavioral performance and of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were correlated with symptom severity with a U-shaped correlations indicating that the LRTCs were largest with moderate symptom scores. These data demonstrate the presence of aberrant temporal dynamics of neuronal oscillations in adult ADHD patients, which may underlie involuntary attentional fluctuations in ADHD. Taken that LRTCs are a hallmark of brain critical dynamics, these data show that moderate ADHD symptoms scores maximize brain criticality which is thought to be beneficial for performance.

                Loss of connectivity between spinal V1 inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons is found early in disease in the SOD1G93A ALS mice. Such changes in premotor inputs can contribute to homeostatic imbalance of vulnerable motor neurons. Here, we show, for the first time, that stabilization of V1 synapses by overexpression of the Extended Synaptotagmin 1 presynaptic organizer increases motor neuron survival and ameliorates motor phenotypes, demonstrating that interneurons can be a potential target to attenuate ALS symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conserved and cell type-specific transcriptional responses to IFN-γ in the ventral midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulated inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuropathology in infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease. With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it remains unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-{gamma} into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We find that IFN-{gamma} induces cellular proliferation and expression of MHC-II and associated genes only in microglia. However, IFN-{gamma} upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-{gamma}-induced genes and their response kinetics were conserved across neurons and glia, with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, while no neuron-specific responses to IFN-{gamma} were observed. Using mutant mice to selectively delete the IFN-{gamma}-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that dopaminergic neurons respond directly to IFN-{gamma}. Our results suggest that most neurons are capable of responding directly to IFN-{gamma} and upregulating MHC-I and related genes in vivo, but their expression amplitude and repertoire is limited compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.

                Preparatory control in task-switching has been suggested to rely upon a set of distributed regions within a frontoparietal network, with frontal and parietal cortical areas cooperating to implement switch-specific preparation processes. Although recent causal evidences using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have generally supported this model, alternative evidences from both functional neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have questioned the switch-specific role of both frontal and parietal cortices. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of prefrontal and parietal areas supporting preparatory cognitive control in task-switching. Within this purpose, an fMRI study during task-switching performance was conducted to identify the specific brain areas involved in preparatory control during performance of a task-switching paradigm. Then, TMS was applied over the specific coordinates previously identified through fMRI, that is, the anterior portion of the inferior frontal junction (aIFJ) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Results revealed that TMS over the aIFJ disrupted performance in both switch and repeat trails in terms of delayed responses as compared to Sham condition. In contrast, TMS over the IPS selectively interfered performance in switch trials. These findings support a multicomponent model of executive control with the aIFJ being involved in more general switch-unspecific process such as the episodic retrieval of goals, and the IPS being related to the implementation of switch-specific preparation mechanisms for activating stimulus-response mappings. The results help conciliating preceding evidences about the role of a frontoparietal network during task-switching, and support current models about a hierarchical organization within prefrontal cortex.

                A stroke is a brain insult that can take offline (often permanently) extended regions of the brain. As a consequence, cognitive tasks or representations implemented by the affected circuitry lose their computational substrate (they become {em orphan}). The brain must adapt to attempt retaining such functions. The existing clinical literature offers a complex picture, often with conflicting observations, about how the brain gets reorganized after stroke. It also does little use of the few mathematical works on the topic. Can a minimal mathematical model of cortical plasticity shed light on this complex phenomenology? Here we explore such minimal model, and find a specific phenomenology: a lasting perilesional reorganization for small injuries, and a temporary contralesional reorganization for large injuries that is not always reverted to ipsilesional. We furthermore show the mechanisms behind these dynamics in our model: a second order phase transition with a critical point, as well as a delayed engagement of perilesional reorganization in large injuries. These dynamics emerge out of a fairly minimal modeling of plasticity, and they reproduce the story put together from clinical observations. We further explore neurorehabilitation strategies, and argue that increased tissue susceptibility (a property that diverges at critical points) can be crucial to manipulate plasticity in beneficial ways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-modal multi-resolution atlas of the human neonatal cerebral cortex based on microstructural similarity</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal period is a critical window for the development of the human brain and may hold implications for the long-term development of cognition and disorders. Multi-modal connectome studies have revealed many important findings underlying the adult brain but related studies were rare in the early human brain. One potential challenge is the lack of an appropriate and unbiased parcellation that combines structural and functional information in this population. Using 348 multi-modal MRI datasets from the developing human connectome project, we found that the information fused from the structural, diffusion, and functional MRI was relatively stable across MRI features and showed high reproducibility at the group level. Therefore, we generated automated multi-resolution parcellations (300 - 500 parcels) based on the similarity across multi-modal features using a gradient-based parcellation algorithm. In addition, to acquire a parcellation with high interpretability, we provided a manually delineated parcellation (210 parcels), which was approximately symmetric, and the adjacent areas around each boundary were statistically different in terms of the integrated similarity metric and at least one kind of original features. Overall, the present study provided multi-resolution and neonate-specific parcellations of the cerebral cortex based on multi-modal MRI properties, which may facilitate future studies of the human connectome in the early development period.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatially heterogeneous structure-function coupling in haemodynamic and electromagnetic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the brain is a key question in connectomics. Here we quantify patterns of structure-function coupling across the neocortex, by comparing structural connectivity estimated using diffusion MRI with functional connectivity estimated using both neurophysiological (MEG-based) and haemodynamic (fMRI-based) recordings. We find that structure-function coupling is heterogeneous across brain regions and frequency bands. The link between structural and functional connectivity is generally stronger in multiple MEG frequency bands compared to resting state fMRI. Structure-function coupling is greater in slower and intermediate frequency bands compared to faster frequency bands. We also find that structure-function coupling systematically follows the archetypal sensorimotor-association hierarchy, as well as patterns of laminar differentiation, peaking in granular layer IV. Finally, structure-function coupling is better explained using structure-informed inter-regional communication metrics than using structural connectivity alone. Collectively, these results place neurophysiological and haemodynamic structure-function relationships in a common frame of reference and provide a starting point for a multi-modal understanding of structure-function coupling in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Autofluorescence is a biomarker of neural stem cell activation state</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain are primarily quiescent but can activate and enter the cell cycle to produce newborn neurons. NSC quiescence can be regulated by disease, injury, and age, however our understanding of NSC quiescence is limited by technical limitations imposed by the bias of markers used to isolate each population of NSCs and the lack of live-cell labeling strategies. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of autofluorescent metabolic cofactors has previously been used in other cell types to study shifts in cell states driven by metabolic remodeling that change the optical properties of these endogenous fluorophores. Here we asked whether autofluorescence could be used to discriminate NSC activation state. We found that quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) and activated NSCs (aNSCs) each have unique autofluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime profiles. Additionally, qNSCs specifically display an enrichment of a specific autofluorescent signal localizing to lysosomes that is highly predictive of cell state. These signals can be used as a graded marker of NSC quiescence to predict cell behavior and track the dynamics of quiescence exit at single cell resolution in vitro and in vivo. Through coupling autofluorescence imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing in vitro and in vivo, we provide a high-resolution resource revealing transcriptional features linked to rapid NSC activation and deep quiescence. Taken together, we describe a single-cell resolution, non-destructive, live-cell, label-free strategy for measuring NSC activation state in vitro and in vivo and use this tool to expand our understanding of adult neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amphetamine disrupts dopamine axon growth in adolescence by a sex-specific mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Initiating drug use during adolescence increases the risk of developing addiction and psychiatric disorders later in life, with long-term outcomes varying according to sex and exact timing of use. Even though most individuals begin experimenting with drugs of abuse in adolescence, to date, the cellular and molecular underpinnings explaining differential sensitivity to detrimental drug effects remain unknown. The Netrin-1/DCC guidance cue system plays a critical role in the adolescent development of mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuitry, segregating the cortical and limbic pathways. Adolescent experiences, including exposure to drugs of abuse, can regulate Dcc expression in male mice, placing Netrin-1/DCC signaling as a potential molecular link between experience and enduring changes to circuitry and behavior. Here we show that exposure to a recreational-like regimen of amphetamine (AMPH) in adolescence induces sex- and age-specific alterations in Dcc expression in the ventral tegmental area. Female mice are protected against the deleterious long-term effects of AMPH-induced Dcc regulation by compensatory changes in the expression of its binding partner, Netrin-1. AMPH induces targeting errors in mesolimbic dopamine axons and triggers their ectopic growth to the prefrontal cortex, only in early-adolescent male mice, underlying a male-specific vulnerability to its enduring cognitive effects. Upregulating DCC receptor expression in dopamine neurons in adolescent males using a neuron-optimized CRISPR/dCas9 Activation System induces female-like protection against the persistent effects of AMPH in early adolescence on inhibitory control. Netrin-1/DCC signaling is therefore a molecular switch which can be differentially regulated in response to the same experience as function of age and sex of the individual, leading to divergent long-term outcomes associated with vulnerable or resilient phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of a time-independent population code in auditory cortex enables sound categorization and discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                Perception generates time-invariant objects and categories from time-varying streams of information. However, individual neuron responses, even in cortex, are not time-invariant as they usually track the temporal variations of the input. Here we show that representations of time-varying sounds remain decodable even after time-averaging at the level of neuronal populations in the mouse auditory cortex. This population-scale, time-invariant property is absent in subcortical auditory regions. By implanting light-sculpted artificial representations in the cortex with optogenetics, we show that robustness to time-averaging is a necessary property for rapid association of neural representations with behavioral output. Moreover, deep neural networks which perform sound recognition and categorization tasks generate population representations that become robust to time-averaging in their deeper layers. Hence, the auditory cortex implements a generic transformation that replicates temporal information into time-independent neural population dimensions and makes it available for learning and classification.

                The neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis impacts the lives of over 700 million people globally. Schistosoma mansoni, the trematode parasite that causes the most common type of schistosomiasis, requires planorbid pond snails of the genus Biomphalaria to support its larval development and transformation to the form that can infect humans. A greater understanding of neural signaling systems that are specific to the Biomphalaria intermediate host could lead to novel strategies for parasite or snail control. This study characterized a Biomphalaria glabrata neural receptor that is gated by the molluscan neuropeptide FMRF-NH2. The Biomphalaria glabrata FMRF-NH2 gated sodium channel (Bgl-FaNaC) amino acid sequence was highly conserved with FaNaCs found in related gastropods, especially the planorbid Planorbella trivolvis (91% sequence identity). In common with the P. trivolvis FaNaC, the B. glabrata receptor exhibited a low affinity (EC50: 3 x 10-4 M) and high specificity for the FMRF-NH2 agonist. Its expression in the central nervous system, detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, was widespread, with the protein localized mainly to neuronal fibers and the mRNA confined to cell bodies. Colocalization was observed with the FMRF-NH2 tetrapeptide precursor in some neurons associated with male mating behavior. At the mRNA level, Bgl-FaNaC expression in the visceral and left parietal ganglia decreased at 20 days post infection by S. mansoni and in the shedding phase. Altered FMRF-NH2 signaling could be vital for parasite survival and proliferation in its snail intermediate host.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-associated downregulation of glutamate and GABA neurotransmission-related gene expression in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of male Fischer 344 rats</a></h4>

              
                The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a part of the medullary reticular formation, plays a major role in several physiological responses, including cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous system functions. Although aging causes disturbances in the responses of these physiological systems, RVLM involvement in these age-related changes is not clear. Previous work using high-throughput gene expression analysis of the RVLM in aged animals suggested that chemical neurotransmission-related genes might be downregulated with advancing age. Since RVLM function involves a balance of signals from inhibitory and excitatory inputs, which is largely mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmission, we hypothesized that aging is associated with altered excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission-related gene expression in the RVLM. To test this hypothesis, we micropunched an RVLM-containing area from young (3-5 months), middle-aged (12-14 months), and aged (22-26 months) Fischer 344 male rats. RNA purified from these micropunches was analyzed using GABA and Glutamate RT2 Profiler PCR arrays (n= 8-10). Each profiler array has primers for 84 GABA and glutamate neurotransmission related genes. In addition, the expression of selected genes was validated at the RNA level using TaqMan(R) based- qPCR and at the protein level using western blotting. All the genes that displayed significant differential expression (1.5-fold, p < .05, FDR < .05) were identified to be downregulated in the RVLM of aged and middle-aged rats compared to young rats. This downregulation did not appear to be a result of RVLM tissue sampling differences among the age groups, since a separate validation of our sampling method, which involved careful mapping of micropunched regions to a standardized brain atlas, revealed no spatial differences in sampled sites among age groups. Among the downregulated genes, the percentage of glutamate neurotransmission-related genes was higher than GABA neurotransmission-related genes. The Solute carrier family 1 member 6 (Slc1a6) gene showed the highest fold downregulation at the RNA level in the RVLM of aged compared to young rats, and its protein product, Excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4), showed a downregulatory trend in the RVLM of aged and middle-aged rats. These results suggest that molecular constituents of both GABA and glutamate neurotransmission might be altered in the RVLM of aged and middle-aged rats, and the changes in glutamate neurotransmission might be more prominent. Investigating age-associated anatomical and functional changes in RVLM GABA and glutamate neurotransmission might provide a foundation for understanding the effects of aging on physiological function.

                Our understanding of how information unfolds when we recall events from memory remains limited. In this study, we investigate whether the reconstruction of visual object memories follows a backward trajectory along the ventral visual stream with respect to perception, such that their neural feature representations are gradually reinstated from late areas close to the hippocampus backwards to lower-level sensory areas. We use multivariate analyses of fMRI activation patterns to map the constituent features of the object memories onto the brain during retrieval, and EEG-fMRI fusion to track the temporal evolution of the reactivated patterns. Participants studied new associations between verbs and randomly paired object images in an encoding phase, and subsequently recalled the objects when presented with the corresponding verb cue. Decoding reactivated memory features from fMRI activity revealed that retrieval patterns were dominated by conceptual features, represented in comparatively late visual and parietal areas. Representational-similarity-based fusion then allowed us to map the EEG patterns that emerged at each given time point of a trial onto the spatially resolved fMRI patterns. This fusion suggests that memory reconstruction proceeds backwards along the ventral visual stream from anterior fronto-temporal to posterior occipital and parietal regions, in line with a semantic-to-perceptual gradient. A linear regression on the peak time points of reactivated brain regions statistically confirms that the temporal progression is reversed with respect to encoding. Together, the results shed light onto the spatio-temporal trajectories along which memories are reconstructed during associative retrieval, and which features of an image are reconstructed when in time and where in the brain.

                Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are the greatest genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Communication between gut and brain and immune dysregulation are increasingly being implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Here, we show that flies lacking the Gba1b gene, the main fly orthologue of GBA1, display widespread innate immune up-regulation, including gut inflammation and brain glial activation. We also demonstrate gut dysfunction in flies lacking Gba1b, with increased intestinal transit time, gut barrier permeability and microbiome dysbiosis. Remarkably, modulating the microbiome of Gba1b knockout flies, by raising them under germ-free conditions, can partially ameliorate lifespan, locomotor and some neuropathological phenotypes. Lastly, direct stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment achieves similar beneficial effects. Overall, our data reveal that the gut microbiome drives systemic immune activation in Gba1b knockout flies and that reducing innate immune response activation either by eliminating the microbiota or clearance of immunogens by autophagy may represent potential therapeutic avenues for GBA1-associated neurodegenerative disease.

                The Insula is a multisensory relay that participates in socio-emotional processing through multiple projections to sensory, cognitive, emotional, and motivational regions. Interestingly, the Insula interhemispheric projection to the contralateral Insula is a strong but understudied projection. Using cutting-edge neuroanatomy, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology associated with specific circuit manipulation, we unraveled the nature and role of Insula interhemispheric communication in social and anxiety processing in mice. In this study, we 1) characterized the anatomical and molecular profile of the interhemispheric neurons of the Insula, 2) highlighted that stimulation of this neuronal subpopulation triggers excitation in the Insula interhemispheric circuit 3) uncovered their engagement in social processing. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that interhemispheric neurons of the Insula constitute a unique class of Insula neurons and proposes new meaningful insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying social behavior.

Although their inputs on neuronal information processing are well established, how molecularly gap junction channels shape neuronal network patterns remains unclear. Here using astroglial connexin-deficient mice, in which astrocytes are disconnected and neuronal bursting patterns are abnormal, we found that astrocyte networks strengthen bursting activity via dynamic regulation of extracellular potassium levels, independently of glutamate homeostasis or metabolic support. Using a novel facilitation-depression model, we identified neuronal afterhyperpolarization as the key parameter underlying bursting patterns regulation by extracellular potassium in mice with disconnected astrocytes. We confirmed experimentally this prediction, and revealed that astroglial network-control of extracellular potassium sustains neuronal afterhyperpolarization via activation of KCNQ voltage-gated K+ channels. Altogether, these data delineate how astroglial gap-junctions mechanistically strengthen neuronal population bursts, and points to approaches for controlling aberrant activity in neurological diseases.

                Temporal anticipation is a fundamental process underlying complex neural functions such as associative learning, decision-making, and motor-preparation. Here we study event anticipation in its simplest form in human participants using magnetoencephalography. We distributed events in time according to different probability density functions and presented the stimuli separately in two different sensory modalities. We found that the temporal dynamics in right parietal cortex correlate with reaction times to anticipated events. Specifically, after an event occurred, event probability was represented in right parietal activity, hinting at a functional role of event-related potential component P300 in temporal expectancy. The results are consistent across both visual and auditory modalities. The right parietal cortex seems to play a central role in the processing of event probability density. Overall, this work contributes to the understanding of the neural processes involved in the anticipation of events in time.

                Here we present a deep learning-based image analysis platform (DLAP), tailored to autonomously quantify numbers of neuronal subtypes in defined areas, and of fluorescence signals, derived from RNAscope probes or immunohistochemistry, in defined cellular compartments. As proof-of-principle, we utilized DLAP to analyse subtypes of dopaminergic midbrain neurons in mouse and human brain-sections. These neurons modulate complex behaviour like voluntary movement, and are differentially affected in Parkinson's and other diseases. DLAP allows the analysis of large cell numbers from different species, and facilitates the identification of small cellular subpopulations, based on differential mRNA- or protein-expression, and anatomical location. Using DLAP, we identified a small subpopulation of dopaminergic midbrain neurons (~5%), mainly located in the very lateral Substantia nigra (SN), that was immunofluorescence-negative for the plasmalemmal dopamine transporter (DAT). These results have important implications, as DAT is crucial for dopamine-signalling, and its expression is commonly used as marker for dopaminergic SN neurons.

                Stepping accuracy, speed, and stability are lower in older compared to young adults. Lower stepping performance in older adults may be due to larger accuracy-speed-stability trade-offs because of reduced ability to simultaneously fulfill these task-level goals. Our goal was to evaluate whether trade-offs are larger in older compared to young adults in a targeted stepping task. Since sensorimotor function declines with age, our secondary goal was to evaluate whether poorer sensorimotor function was associated with larger trade-offs. 25 young (median 22 years old) and 25 older (median 70 years old) adults stepped into projected targets in conditions with various levels of accuracy, speed, and stability requirements. We determined trade-offs as the change in performance, i.e. foot placement error, step duration, and mediolateral center of pressure path length, between each of these conditions and a control condition. To assess age-related differences in the magnitude of trade-offs, we compared the change in performance between age groups. Associations between trade-offs and measures of sensorimotor function were tested using correlations. We found an accuracy-speed and an accuracy-stability trade-off in both young and older adults, but trade-offs were not different between young and older adults. Inter-subject differences in sensorimotor function could not explain inter-subject differences in trade-offs. Age-related differences in the ability to combine task-level goals do not explain why older adults stepped less accurate and less stable than young adults. However, lower stability combined with an age-independent accuracy-stability trade-off could explain lower accuracy in older adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Paradoxical improvement of cognitive control in older adults under dual-task walking conditions is associated with more flexible reallocation of neural resources: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MoBI) study.</a></h4>

              
                Combining walking with a demanding cognitive task is traditionally expected to elicit decrements in gait and/or cognitive task performance. However, it was recently shown that, in a cohort of young adults, most participants paradoxically improved performance when walking was added to performance of a Go/NoGo response inhibition task. The present study aims to extend these previous findings to an older adult cohort, to investigate whether this paradoxical improvement when dual-tasking is observed in healthy older adults. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) was used to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, three-dimensional (3D) gait kinematics and behavioral responses in the Go/NoGo task, during sitting or walking on a treadmill, in 34 young adults and 37 older adults. Increased response accuracy during walking, independent of age, was found to correlate with slower responses to stimuli and with walking-related EEG amplitude modulations over latencies and topographies related to the cognitive component of inhibition. On the other hand, aging, independent of response accuracy during walking, was found to correlate with slower treadmill walking speeds and attenuation in walking-related EEG amplitude modulations over latencies and topographies associated with the motor component of inhibition. Older adults whose response accuracy improved during walking manifested neural signatures of both behavioral improvement and aging, suggesting that their flexibility in reallocating neural resources while walking might be maintained for the cognitive but not for the motor inhibitory component. These distinct neural signatures of aging and behavior can potentially be used to identify super-agers, or individuals at risk for cognitive decline due to aging or neurodegenerative disease.

                Many animals rely on vision to navigate through their environment. The pattern of changes in the visual scene induced by self-motion is the optic flow, which is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective (DS) neurons. But how should the arrays of DS neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at a specific retinal position, be organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits? Understanding this global organization is challenging because it requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across the animal's field of view. In Drosophila, the asymmetric dendrites of the T4 and T5 DS neurons establish their preferred direction, making it possible to predict DS responses from anatomy. Here we report that the preferred directions of fly DS neurons vary at different retinal positions and show that this spatial variation is established by the anatomy of the compound eye. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in a full brain EM volume and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations that are independent of location. We then used whole-head CT scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the organization of preferred directions in the fly is largely determined by the compound eye, exposing an intimate and unexpected connection between the peripheral structure of the eye, functional properties of neurons deep in the brain, and the control of body movements.

                Understanding how the brain encodes behaviour is the ultimate goal of neuroscience and the ability to objectively and reproducibly describe and quantify behaviour is a necessary milestone on this path. Recent progresses in machine learning and computational power have pushed the development and adoption of powerful systems leveraging on high-resolution videorecording to track pose and describe behaviour in all four dimensions, however the temporal and spatial resolution of these systems come as a compromise with their throughput and accessibility. Here we describe coccinella, an open source reductionist framework that allows for high-throughput analysis of behaviour using real-time tracking on a distributed mesh of microcomputers followed by resource-lean statistical learning. We show that a reductionist system outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives when exploring the pharmacobehaviour in Drosophila melanogaster.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing endogenous delta oscillations non-invasively in humans</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic activity in the delta frequency range (0.5 - 3 Hz) is a prominent feature of brain dynamics, mainly found in invasive recordings. In humans, stimulus-brain coherence in the delta band is commonly reported, and has been shown to influence behaviour. However, periodic brain dynamics observed during periodic sensory inputs cannot be interpreted as endogenous oscillations, and hence are not sufficient to confirm the influential theory of neural entrainment. To fill this gap, we examined whether spontaneous delta oscillations, as found in invasive recordings in awake animals, can be observed in non-invasive recordings performed in humans using M/EEG during resting. To increase our chances for observing oscillatory brain dynamics, we additionally analysed two conditions in which participants engaged in spontaneous finger tapping and silent counting, arguing that internally rhythmic behaviours could incite an otherwise silent neural oscillator. Using a novel set of analysis steps allowed us to show narrow spectral peaks in the delta frequency range in rest and during overt and covert rhythmic activity. Additional analyses in the time domain, however revealed that only the resting state condition warranted an interpretation of these peaks as endogenously periodic neural dynamics. In sum, this work shows that using advanced signal processing techniques, it is possible to observe endogenous delta oscillations in non-invasive recordings of human brain dynamics.

                A cognitive map is a suitably structured representation that enables an agent to perform novel computations using prior experience, for instance planning a new route in a familiar space[1,2]. Recent work in mammals has found direct evidence for such structured representations in the presence of exogenous sensory inputs in both spatial[3,4] and non-spatial domains[5-15]. Here, we test a foundational postulate of the original cognitive map theory[1,16] that cognitive maps are recruited endogenously during mental navigation without external input. We recorded from the entorhinal cortex of monkeys in a mental navigation task that required animals to use a joystick to produce one-dimensional vectors between pairs of visual landmarks without sensory feedback about the intermediate landmarks. Animals' ability to perform the task and generalize to new pairs indicated that they relied on a structured representation of the landmarks. Task-modulated neurons exhibited periodicity and ramping that matched the temporal structure of the landmarks. Neuron pairs with high periodicity scores had invariant cross-correlation structure, a signature of grid cell continuous attractor states[17-19]. A basic continuous attractor network model of path integration[20] augmented with a Hebbian learning mechanism provided an explanation of how the system endogenously recalls landmarks. The model also made an unexpected prediction that endogenous landmarks transiently slow down path integration, reset the dynamics, and thereby, reduce variability. Remarkably, this prediction was borne out of a reanalysis of behavior. Together, our findings connect the structured activity patterns in the entorhinal cortex to the endogenous recruitment of a cognitive map during mental navigation.

	<p>The long-term burden of symptoms is an important outcome in bipolar disorder (BD). A method which has minimal burden of assessment uses a retrospective interview, the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Examination (LIFE), although this may be subject to problems with recall. This study examines the relationship between the retrospective LIFE scale and concurrently-rated mood rating scales in two clinical trials of 18 months of psychotherapy for patients with BD. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) were administered every eight to nine weeks and the LIFE was carried out every 6 months. Correlations between scores on mood rating scales and at equivalent times on the LIFE were examined, as well as of potential clinical moderators. There were significant correlations between LIFE depression ratings and concurrent MADRS score (r = 0.57) and between LIFE mania ratings and YMRS score (r = 0.40). In determining &amp;amp;ldquo;mild depression&amp;amp;rdquo; on the MADRS, a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed an AUC of 0.78 for LIFE scores. Correlations, particularly for depression scores, were high even when the LIFE rating was several months before the interview, suggesting that the LIFE has validity in examining the burden of mood symptoms over time, with relatively little burden of assessment. Future research should examine the relationship between symptom burden and quality of life measured in this way.</p>

	<p>There are multiple forms of knowledge about people. Whether diverse person-related data interact is of interest regarding the more general issue of integration of multi-source information about the world. Our goal was to examine whether perception of a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s face or voice enhanced the encoding of their biographic data. We performed three experiments. In the first experiment, subjects learned the biographic data of a character with or without a video clip of their face. In the second experiment, they learned the character&amp;amp;rsquo;s data with an audio clip of either a generic narrator&amp;amp;rsquo;s voice or the character&amp;amp;rsquo;s voice relating the same biographic information. In the third experiment, an audiovisual clip of both the face and voice of either a generic narrator or the character accompanied the learning of biographic data. After learning, a test phase presented biographic data alone, and subjects were tested first for familiarity and second for matching of biographic data to the name. The results showed equivalent learning of biographic data across all three experiments, and none showed evidence that a character&amp;amp;rsquo;s face or voice enhanced the learning of biographic information. We conclude that the simultaneous processing of perceptual representations of people may not modulate the encoding of biographic data.</p>

	<p>Skin erosion is a hardware-related complication commonly described after deep brain stimulation (DBS). Hardware exposure is often associated with the development of infection that can lead to implant removal. However, in selected cases, it is possible to manage skin erosion without having to remove the hardware. This article presents the case of a patient with recurrent skin erosions above the IPG, who underwent multiple surgeries. Given the failure of less invasive approaches, a more complex surgery with the employment of a pedunculated flap of pectoralis major in order to cover the IPG was attempted. Nevertheless, the IPG removal was finally unavoidable, resulting in a rapid decline in clinical performance. This illustrative case suggests how, in patients with sustained stimulation who benefit from a good degree of autonomy, it may be useful to use invasive surgical techniques to resolve skin erosions and save the DBS system. In spite of everything, sometimes complete or partial removal of the implant still becomes unavoidable, but this can lead to a severe worsening of PD symptoms. Definitive removal of the system should therefore be considered only in cases of frank infection or after failure of all other approaches.</p>

	<p>General anesthesia has been shown to induce significant changes in the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. However, traditional methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) lack the spatial resolution to study the effects of general anesthesia on individual cortical neurons. This study aimed to use high-resolution two-photon imaging, which can provide single-neuron resolution, to investigate the characteristics of consciousness under general anesthesia. We used C57BL/6J and Thy1-GCamp6s mice and found that at similar levels of sedation, as measured by EEG, dexmedetomidine did not significantly inhibit the spontaneous activity of neuronal somata in the S1 cortex, but preserved the frequency of calcium events in neuronal spines. In contrast, propofol and ketamine dramatically inhibited the spontaneous activity of both neuronal somata and spines. The S1 cortex still responded to whisker stimulation under dexmedetomidine anesthesia, but not under propofol or ketamine anesthesia. Our results suggest that dexmedetomidine anesthesia has unique neuronal properties associated with its ability to facilitate easy awakening in the clinic. These findings provide insights into the development of more effective strategies for monitoring consciousness during general anesthesia.</p>

	<p>Mnemonic enhanced memory has been observed for negative events. Here, we investigate its association with spatiotemporal attention, consolidation, and age. An ingenious method to study visual attention for emotional stimuli is eye tracking. Twenty young adults and twenty-one older adults encoded stimuli depicting neutral faces, angry faces, and houses while eye movements were recorded. The encoding phase was followed by an immediate and delayed (48 h) recognition assessment. Linear mixed model analyses of recognition performance with group, emotion, and their interaction as fixed effects revealed increased performance for angry compared to neutral faces in the young adults group only. Furthermore, young adults showed enhanced memory for angry faces compared to older adults. This effect was associated with a shorter fixation duration for angry faces compared to neutral faces in the older adults group. Furthermore, the results revealed that total fixation duration was a strong predictor for face memory performance.</p>

	<p>Astroglia are an active element of brain plasticity, capable to release small molecule gliotransmitters by various mechanisms and regulate synaptic strength. While importance of glia-neuron communications for long-term potentiation has been rather widely reported, research into role for astrocytes in long-depression (LTD) is just gaining momentum. Here, we explored the role for astrocytes in the prominent form of synaptic plasticity&amp;amp;mdash;mGluR-dependent LTD. We found out the substantial contribution of the Group I receptors, especially mGluR1 subtype, into Ca2+-signaling in hippocampal and neocortical astrocytes, which can be activated during synaptic stimulation used for LTD induction. Our data demonstrate that mGluR receptors can activate SNARE-dependent release of ATP from astrocytes which in turn can directly activate postsynaptic P2X receptors in the hippocampal and neocortical neurons. The latter mechanism has recently been shown to cause the synaptic depression via triggering the internalisation of AMPA receptors. Using mouse model of impaired glial exocytosis (dnSNARE mice), we demonstrated that mGluR-activated release of ATP from astrocytes is essential for regulation of mGluR-dependent LTD in CA3-CA1 and layer 2/3 synapses. Our data also suggest that astrocyte-related pathway relies mainly on mGluR1 receptors and act synergistically with neuronal mechanisms dependent mainly on mGluR5.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Protective Effect of Social Reward on Opioid and Psychostimulant Reward and Relapse: Behavior, Pharmacology, and Brain Regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Until recently, most modern neuroscience research on addiction using animal models did not incorporate manipulations of social factors. Social factors play a critical role in human addiction: social isolation and exclusion can promote drug use and relapse, while social connections and inclusion tend to be protective. Here, we discuss the state of the literature on social factors in animal models of opioid and psychostimulant preference, self-administration, and relapse. We first summarize results from rodent studies on behavioral, pharmacological, and circuit mechanisms of the protective effect of traditional experimenter-controlled social interaction procedures on opioid and psychostimulant conditioned place preference, self-administration, and relapse. Next, we summarize behavioral and brain-mechanism results from studies using newer operant social-interaction procedures that inhibit opioid and psychostimulant self-administration and relapse. We conclude by discussing how the reviewed studies point to future directions for the addiction field and other neuroscience and psychiatric fields, and their implications for mechanistic understanding of addiction and development of new treatments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this review, we propose that incorporating social factors into modern neuroscience research on addiction could improve mechanistic accounts of addiction and help close gaps in translating discovery to treatment. We first summarize rodent studies on behavioral, pharmacological, and circuit mechanisms of the protective effect of both traditional experimenter-controlled and newer operant social-interaction procedures. We then discuss potential future directions and clinical implications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brief Opioid Exposure Paradoxically Augments Primary Afferent Input to Spinal Excitatory Neurons via {alpha}2{delta}-1-Dependent Presynaptic NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Treatment with opioids not only inhibits nociceptive transmission but also elicits a rebound and persistent increase in primary afferent input to the spinal cord. Opioid-elicited long-term potentiation (LTP) from TRPV1-expressing primary afferents plays a major role in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. Here, we determined whether opioid-elicited LTP involves vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2) or vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn of male and female mice and identified underlying signaling mechanisms. Spinal cord slice recordings revealed that &micro;-opioid receptor (MOR) stimulation with DAMGO initially inhibited dorsal root&ndash;evoked EPSCs in 87% VGluT2 neurons and subsequently induced LTP in 49% of these neurons. Repeated morphine treatment increased the prevalence of VGluT2 neurons displaying LTP with a short onset latency. In contrast, DAMGO inhibited EPSCs in 46% VGAT neurons but did not elicit LTP in any VGAT neurons even in morphine-treated mice. Spinal superficial laminae were densely innervated by MOR-containing nerve terminals and were occupied by mostly VGluT2 neurons and few VGAT neurons. Furthermore, conditional <I>Grin1</I> knockout in dorsal root ganglion neurons diminished DAMGO-elicited LTP in lamina II neurons and attenuated hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance induced by repeated treatment with morphine. In addition, DAMGO-elicited LTP in VGluT2 neurons was abolished by protein kinase C inhibition, gabapentin, <I>Cacna2d1</I> knockout, or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDA receptor interaction with an &alpha;2-1 C terminus peptide. Thus, brief MOR stimulation distinctively potentiates nociceptive primary afferent input to excitatory dorsal horn neurons via &alpha;2-1&ndash;coupled presynaptic NMDA receptors, thereby causing hyperalgesia and reducing analgesic actions of opioids.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioid drugs are potent analgesics for treating severe pain and are commonly used during general anesthesia. However, opioid use often induces pain hypersensitivity, rapid loss of analgesic efficacy, and dose escalation, which can cause dependence, addiction, and even overdose fatality. This study demonstrates for the first time that brief opioid exposure preferentially augments primary sensory input to genetically identified glutamatergic excitatory, but not GABAergic/glycinergic inhibitory, neurons in nociceptive dorsal horn circuits. This opioid-elicited synaptic plasticity is cell type specific and mediated by protein kinase C&ndash;dependent and &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent activation of NMDA receptors at primary sensory nerve terminals. These findings elucidate how intraoperative use of opioids for preemptive analgesia paradoxically aggravates postoperative pain and increases opioid consumption and suggest new strategies to improve opioid analgesic efficacy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Recovery of Submodality Touch Neurons and Interareal Communication in Sensory Input-Deprived Area 3b and S2 Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical reactivation and regain of interareal functional connections have been linked to the recovery of hand grasping behavior after loss of sensory inputs in primates. We investigated contributions of neurons in two hierarchically organized somatosensory areas, 3b and S2, by characterizing local field potential (LFP) and multiunit spiking activity in five states (rest, stimulus-on, sustained, stimulus-off, and induced) and interareal communication after grasping behavior of dorsal column lesioned male squirrel monkeys had mostly recovered. Compared with normal cortex, fMRI, LFP, and spiking response magnitudes to step indentations were significantly weaker. The sustained component of the spiking recovered much better than the stimulus-off response. Correlation between overall spiking and  LFP remained strong within each recovered areas 3b and S2. The interareal correlations of  LFP were severely disrupted, except in the resting and stimulus-on periods. Interareal correlation of spiking was disrupted in the stimulus-off period only. In summary, submodality of low threshold mechanoreceptive neurons recovered differentially in input-deprived area 3b and S2 when impaired global hand grasping behavior returned. Slow-adapting-like neurons recovered, whereas rapid-adapting-like neurons did not. Interareal communications were also severely compromised. We propose that slow-adapting-like neurons and afferents in recovered area 3b and S2 mediate recovery of impaired grasping behavior after dorsal column tract lesion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory feedback is essential for execution of hand grasping behavior in primates. Reactivations of somatosensory cortices have been attributed to recovery of such behavior after loss of sensory inputs via largely unknown mechanisms. In input-deprived area 3b and S2 cortex, after hand grasping behavior mostly recovered, we found slow-adapting-like neurons were greatly recovered, whereas rapid-adapting-like neurons did not. Communications between area 3b and S2 neurons were severely compromised. We suggest that recovery of slow-adapting-like neurons in input-deprived area 3b and S2 may mediate the recovery of hand grasping behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Accounting for Bias in the Estimation of r2 between Two Sets of Noisy Neural Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Pearson correlation coefficient squared, <I>r</I><sup>2</sup>, is an important tool used in the analysis of neural data to quantify the similarity between neural tuning curves. Yet this metric is biased by trial-to-trial variability; as trial-to-trial variability increases, measured correlation decreases. Major lines of research are confounded by this bias, including those involving the study of invariance of neural tuning across conditions and the analysis of the similarity of tuning across neurons. To address this, we extend an estimator, <f></f>, that was recently developed for estimating model-to-neuron correlation, in which a noisy signal is compared with a noise-free prediction, to the case of neuron-to-neuron correlation, in which two noisy signals are compared with each other. We compare the performance of our novel estimator to a prior method developed by Spearman, commonly used in other fields but widely overlooked in neuroscience, and find that our method has less bias. We then apply our estimator to demonstrate how it avoids drastic confounds introduced by trial-to-trial variability using data collected in two prior studies (macaque, both sexes) that examined two different forms of invariance in the neural encoding of visual inputs&mdash;translation invariance and fill-outline invariance. Our results quantify for the first time the gradual falloff with spatial offset of translation-invariant shape selectivity within visual cortical neuronal receptive fields and offer a principled method to compare invariance in noisy biological systems to that in noise-free models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Quantifying the similarity between two sets of averaged neural responses is fundamental to the analysis of neural data. A ubiquitous metric of similarity, the correlation coefficient, is attenuated by trial-to-trial variability that arises from many irrelevant factors. Spearman recognized this problem and proposed corrected methods that have been extended over a century. We show this method has large asymptotic biases that can be overcome using a novel estimator. Despite the frequent use of the correlation coefficient in neuroscience, consensus on how to address this fundamental statistical issue has not been reached. We provide an accurate estimator of the correlation coefficient and apply it to gain insight into visual invariance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Faster Detection of "Darks" than "Brights" by Monkey Superior Colliculus Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual processing is segregated into ON and OFF channels as early as in the retina, and the superficial (output) layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) are dominated by neurons preferring dark stimuli. However, it is not clear how the timing of neural processing differs between "darks" and "brights" in general, especially in light of psychophysical evidence; it is also equally not clear how subcortical visual pathways that are critical for active orienting represent stimuli of positive (luminance increments) and negative (luminance decrements) contrast polarity. Here, we recorded from all visually-responsive neuron types in the superior colliculus (SC) of two male rhesus macaque monkeys. We presented a disk (0.51&deg; radius) within the response fields (RFs) of neurons, and we varied, across trials, stimulus Weber contrast relative to a gray background. We also varied contrast polarity. There was a large diversity of preferences for darks and brights across the population. However, regardless of individual neural sensitivity, most neurons responded significantly earlier to dark than bright stimuli. This resulted in a dissociation between neural preference and visual response onset latency: a neuron could exhibit a weaker response to a dark stimulus than to a bright stimulus of the same contrast, but it would still have an earlier response to the dark stimulus. Our results highlight an additional candidate visual neural pathway for explaining behavioral differences between the processing of darks and brights, and they demonstrate the importance of temporal aspects in the visual neural code for orienting eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Objects in our environment, such as birds flying across a bright sky, often project shadows (or images darker than the surround) on our retina. We studied how primate superior colliculus (SC) neurons visually process such dark stimuli. We found that the overall population of SC neurons represented both dark and bright stimuli equally well, as evidenced by a relatively equal distribution of neurons that were either more or less sensitive to darks. However, independent of sensitivity, the great majority of neurons detected dark stimuli earlier than bright stimuli, evidenced by a smaller response latency for the dark stimuli. Thus, SC neural response latency can be dissociated from response sensitivity, and it favors the faster detection of dark image contrasts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pattern Motion Direction Is Encoded in the Population Activity of Macaque Area MT</a></h4>

              
                <p>Direction selective neurons in macaque primary visual cortex are narrowly tuned for orientation, and are thus afflicted by the aperture problem. At the next stage of motion processing, in the middle temporal (MT) area, some cells appear to solve this problem, responding to the pattern motion direction of plaids. Models have been proposed to account for this computation, but they do not replicate the diversity of responses observed in MT. We recorded from 386 cells in area MT of two male macaques, while presenting a wide range of random-line stimuli and their compositions into noise plaids. As we broadened the range of stimuli used to probe the cells, yielding ever more challenging conditions for extracting pattern motion, the diversity of the responses observed increased, and the fraction of cells that faithfully encoded pattern motion direction shrank. However, we show here that a pattern motion signal is present at the population level. We identified four mechanisms, one never proposed before, that together might account for the observed diversity in single-cell responses. Pattern motion is thus extracted in area MT, but it is encoded across the population, and not in a small subset of pattern neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Some neurons in the middle temporal area of macaques solve the aperture problem, signaling the direction of motion of complex patterns. As the number of pattern types used to probe this mechanism is increased, fewer and fewer cells retain this capability. We show here that different cells fail in different ways, and that simply summing their responses averages away their failures, yielding a clear pattern motion signal. Similar encodings, which unequivocally violate the "neuron as a feature detector" hypothesis that has dominated sensory processing theories for the past 50 years, might apply throughout the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deterministic and Stochastic Components of Cortical Down States: Dynamics and Modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Slow oscillations are an emergent activity of the cerebral cortex network consisting of alternating periods of activity (Up states) and silence (Down states). Up states are periods of persistent cortical activity that share properties with that of underlying wakefulness. However, the occurrence of Down states is almost invariably associated with unconsciousness, both in animal models and clinical studies. Down states have been attributed relevant functions, such as being a resetting mechanism or breaking causal interactions between cortical areas. But what do Down states consist of? Here, we explored in detail the network dynamics (e.g., synchronization and phase) during these silent periods <I>in vivo</I> (male mice), <I>in vitro</I> (ferrets, either sex), and <I>in silico</I>, investigating various experimental conditions that modulate them: anesthesia levels, excitability (electric fields), and excitation/inhibition balance. We identified metastability as two complementary phases composing such quiescence states: a highly synchronized "deterministic" period followed by a low-synchronization "stochastic" period. The balance between these two phases determines the dynamical properties of the resulting rhythm, as well as the responsiveness to incoming inputs or refractoriness. We propose detailed Up and Down state cycle dynamics that bridge cortical properties emerging at the mesoscale with their underlying mechanisms at the microscale, providing a key to understanding unconscious states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebral cortex expresses slow oscillations consisting of Up (active) and Down (silent) states. Such activity emerges not only in slow wave sleep, but also under anesthesia and in brain lesions. Down states functionally disconnect the network, and are associated with unconsciousness. Based on a large collection of data, novel data analysis approaches and computational modeling, we thoroughly investigate the nature of Down states. We identify two phases: a highly synchronized "deterministic" period, followed by a low-synchronization "stochastic" period. The balance between these two phases determines the dynamic properties of the resulting rhythm and responsiveness to incoming inputs. This finding reconciles different theories of slow rhythm generation and provides clues about how the brain switches from conscious to unconscious brain states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Impact of Multivesicular Release on the Transmission of Sensory Information by Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The statistics of vesicle release determine how synapses transfer information, but the classical Poisson model of independent release does not always hold at the first stages of vision and hearing. There, ribbon synapses also encode sensory signals as events comprising two or more vesicles released simultaneously. The implications of such coordinated multivesicular release (MVR) for spike generation are not known. Here we investigate how MVR alters the transmission of sensory information compared with Poisson synapses using a pure rate-code. We used leaky integrate-and-fire models incorporating the statistics of release measured experimentally from glutamatergic synapses of retinal bipolar cells in zebrafish (both sexes) and compared these with models assuming Poisson inputs constrained to operate at the same average rates. We find that MVR can increase the number of spikes generated per vesicle while reducing interspike intervals and latency to first spike. The combined effect was to increase the efficiency of information transfer (bits per vesicle) over a range of conditions mimicking target neurons of different size. MVR was most advantageous in neurons with short time constants and reliable synaptic inputs, when less convergence was required to trigger spikes. In the special case of a single input driving a neuron, as occurs in the auditory system of mammals, MVR increased information transfer whenever spike generation required more than one vesicle. This study demonstrates how presynaptic integration of vesicles by MVR can increase the efficiency with which sensory information is transmitted compared with a rate-code described by Poisson statistics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons communicate by the stochastic release of vesicles at the synapse and the statistics of this process will determine how information is represented by spikes. The classical model is that vesicles are released independently by a Poisson process, but this does not hold at ribbon-type synapses specialized to transmit the first electrical signals in vision and hearing, where two or more vesicles can fuse in a single event by a process termed coordinated multivesicular release. This study shows that multivesicular release can increase the number of spikes generated per vesicle and the efficiency of information transfer (bits per vesicle) over a range of conditions found in the retina and peripheral auditory system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conserved Population Dynamics in the Cerebro-Cerebellar System between Waking and Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite the importance of the cerebellum for motor learning, and the recognized role of sleep in motor memory consolidation, surprisingly little is known about neural activity in the sleeping cerebro-cerebellar system. Here, we used wireless recording from primary motor cortex (M1) and the cerebellum in three female monkeys to examine the relationship between patterns of single-unit spiking activity observed during waking behavior and in natural sleep. Across the population of recorded units, we observed similarities in the timing of firing relative to local field potential features associated with both movements during waking and up state during sleep. We also observed a consistent pattern of asymmetry in pairwise cross-correlograms, indicative of preserved sequential firing in both wake and sleep at low frequencies. Despite the overall similarity in population dynamics between wake and sleep, there was a global change in the timing of cerebellar activity relative to motor cortex, from contemporaneous in the awake state to motor cortex preceding the cerebellum in sleep. We speculate that similar population dynamics in waking and sleep may imply that cerebellar internal models are activated in both states, despite the absence of movement when asleep. Moreover, spindle frequency coherence between the cerebellum and motor cortex may provide a mechanism for cerebellar computations to influence sleep-dependent learning processes in the motor cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that sleep can lead to improved motor performance. One possibility is that off-line learning results from neural activity during sleep in brain areas responsible for the control of movement. In this study we show for the first time that neuronal patterns in the cerebro-cerebellar system are conserved during both movements and sleep up-states, albeit with a shift in the relative timing between areas. Additionally, we show the presence of simultaneous M1-cerebellar spike coherence at spindle frequencies associated with up-state replay and postulate that this is a mechanism whereby a cerebellar internal model can shape plasticity in neocortical circuits during sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Midbrain-Hippocampus Structural Connectivity Selectively Predicts Motivated Memory Encoding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motivation is a powerful driver of learning and memory. Functional MRI studies show that interactions among the dopaminergic midbrain substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are critical for motivated memory encoding. However, it is not known whether these effects are transient and purely functional, or whether individual differences in the structure of this circuit underlie motivated memory encoding. To quantify individual differences in structure, diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography were used to quantify SN/VTA&ndash;striatum and SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus pathways associated with motivated memory encoding in humans. Male and female participants completed a motivated source memory paradigm. During encoding, words were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, reward ($1.00), control ($0.00), or punishment (&ndash;$1.00). During retrieval, participants were asked to retrieve item and source information of the previously studied words and were rewarded or penalized according to their performance. Source memory for words assigned to both reward and punishment conditions was greater than those for control words, but there were no differences in item memory based on value. Anatomically, probabilistic tractography results revealed a heterogeneous, topological arrangement of the SN/VTA. Tract density measures of SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus pathways were positively correlated with individual differences in reward-and-punishment-modulated memory performance, whereas density of SN/VTA&ndash;striatum pathways showed no association. This novel finding suggests that pathways emerging from the human SV/VTA are anatomically separable and functionally heterogeneous. Individual differences in structural connectivity of the dopaminergic hippocampus&ndash;VTA loop are selectively associated with motivated memory encoding.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional MRI studies show that interactions among the SN/VTA, hippocampus, and NAc are critical for motivated memory encoding. This has led to competing theories that posit either SN/VTA&ndash;NAc reward prediction errors or SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus signals underlie motivated memory encoding. Additionally, it is not known whether these effects are transient and purely functional or whether individual differences in the structure of these circuits underlie motivated memory encoding. Using diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography, we show that tract density measures of SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus pathways are positively correlated with motivated memory performance, whereas density of SN/VTA&ndash;striatum pathways show no association. This finding suggests that anatomic individual differences of the dopaminergic hippocampus&ndash;VTA loop are selectively associated with motivated memory encoding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatiotemporal Atlas of the Fetal Brain Depicts Cortical Developmental Gradient</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fetal brains experience rapid and complex development <I>in utero</I> during the second and third trimesters. <I>In utero</I> MRI of the fetal brain in this period enables us to quantify normal fetal brain development in the spatiotemporal domain. In this study, we established a high-quality spatiotemporal atlas between 23 and 38 weeks gestational age (GA) from 90 healthy Chinese human fetuses of both sexes using a pairwise and groupwise registration pipeline. We quantified the fetal cortical morphology indices and characterized their spatiotemporal developmental pattern. The cortical thickness exhibited a biphasic pattern that first increased and then decreased; the curvature fitted well into the Gompertz growth model; sulcal depth increased linearly, while surface area expanded exponentially. The cortical thickness and curvature trajectories consistently pointed to a characteristic time point around GA of 31 weeks. The characteristic GA and growth rate obtained from individual cortical regions suggested a central-to-peripheral developmental gradient, with the earliest development in the parietal lobe, and we also observed a superior-to-inferior gradient within the temporal lobe. These findings may be linked to biophysical events, such as dendritic arborization and thalamocortical fibers ingrowth. The proposed atlas was also compared with an existing fetal atlas from a white/mixed population. Finally, we examined the structural asymmetry of the fetal brains and found extensive asymmetry that dynamically changed with development. The current study depicted a comprehensive profile of fetal cortical development, and the established atlas could be used as a normative reference for neurodevelopmental and diagnostic purposes, especially in the Chinese population.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We generated a high-quality 4D spatiotemporal atlas of the normal fetal brain development from 23 to 38 gestational weeks in a Chinese population and characterized the spatiotemporal developmental pattern of cortical morphology. According to the cortical development trajectories, the fetal cerebral cortex development follows a central-to-peripheral developmental gradient that may be related to the underlying cellular events. The majority of cortical regions already exhibit significant asymmetry during the fetal period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of NF1 in Drosophila Larvae Causes Tactile Hypersensitivity and Impaired Synaptic Transmission at the Neuromuscular Junction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which the mechanisms underlying its core symptomatology are largely unknown. Studying animal models of monogenic syndromes associated with ASD, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can offer insights into its etiology. Here, we show that loss of function of the <I>Drosophila NF1</I> ortholog results in tactile hypersensitivity following brief mechanical stimulation in the larva (mixed sexes), paralleling the sensory abnormalities observed in individuals with ASD. Mutant larvae also exhibit synaptic transmission deficits at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ), with increased spontaneous but reduced evoked release. While the latter is homeostatically compensated for by a postsynaptic increase in input resistance, the former is consistent with neuronal hyperexcitability. Indeed, diminished expression of <I>NF1</I> specifically within central cholinergic neurons induces both excessive neuronal firing and tactile hypersensitivity, suggesting the two may be linked. Furthermore, both impaired synaptic transmission and behavioral deficits are fully rescued via knock-down of Ras proteins. These findings validate <I>NF1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> <I>Drosophila</I> as a tractable model of ASD with the potential to elucidate important pathophysiological mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1&ndash;2% of the overall population and can considerably impact an individual's quality of life. However, there are currently no treatments available for its core symptoms, largely because of a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved. Examining how loss of function of the ASD-associated <I>NF1</I> gene affects behavior and physiology in <I>Drosophila</I> may shed light on this. In this study, we identify a novel, ASD-relevant behavioral phenotype in <I>NF1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae, namely an enhanced response to mechanical stimulation, which is associated with Ras-dependent synaptic transmission deficits indicative of neuronal hyperexcitability. Such insights support the use of <I>Drosophila</I> neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) models in ASD research and may provide outputs for genetic or pharmacological screens in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Intracellular Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein Aggregates Promotes S-Nitrosylation of MAP1A Leading to Decreased NMDAR-Evoked Calcium Influx and Loss of Mature Synaptic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, collectively known as Lewy body dementia, are characterized by the aberrant aggregation of misfolded &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) protein into large inclusions in cortical tissue, leading to impairments in proteostasis and synaptic connectivity and eventually resulting in neurodegeneration. Here, we show that male and female rat cortical neurons exposed to exogenous &alpha;-syn preformed fibrils accumulate large, detergent-insoluble, PS129-labeled deposits at synaptic terminals. Live-cell imaging of calcium dynamics coupled with assessment of network activity reveals that aberrant intracellular accumulation of &alpha;-syn inhibits synaptic response to glutamate through NMDARs, although deficits manifest slowly over a 7 d period. Impairments in NMDAR activity temporally correlated with increased nitric oxide synthesis and S-nitrosylation of the dendritic scaffold protein, microtubule-associated protein 1A. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis via the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor <scp>l</scp>-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester blocked microtubule-associated protein 1A S-nitrosylation and normalized NMDAR-dependent inward calcium transients and overall network activity. Collectively, these data suggest that loss of synaptic function in Lewy body dementia may result from synucleinopathy-evoked nitrosative stress and subsequent NMDAR dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work shows the importance of the redox state of microtubule-associated protein 1A in the maintenance of synaptic function through regulation of NMDAR. We show that &alpha;-syn preformed fibrils promote nitric oxide synthesis, which triggers S-nitrosylation of microtubule-associated protein 1A, leading to impairment of NMDAR-dependent glutamate responses. This offers insight into the mechanism of synaptic dysfunction in Lewy body dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vaccine approach for human monkeypox over the years and current recommendations to prevent the outbreak: a rapid review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The World Health Organization has declared human monkeypox as a global health emergency on 23 July 2022. This indicates that the outbreak poses a serious risk to global health and requires a united worldwide response to stop the virus from spreading and possibly turning into a pandemic. Vaccines can play a vital role in this context, contributing to pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Methods: The aim of our rapid review was to go through the background of the vaccine approach for human monkeypox over the years and to find out what current guidelines are highlighting relating to it. A rapid review with a systematic search and manual searching have been performed here. Results: 22 relevant published articles from MEDLINE bibliographic database and 8 vaccine recommendations from manual searching have been deliberated here. Conclusion: The significant synopsis of this review is that the smallpox vaccine is the only immunization option for monkeypox so far, and it is up to 85% effective to prevent the infection. Third-generation smallpox vaccines are advised over first and second generations due to their minimal side effects. Healthcare providers and lab professionals at risk are on the priority list to get vaccinated, as well as pregnant women or lactating mothers, and immunocompromised or chronically ill patients can get vaccinated if they are surely exposed to the monkeypox infection. Lastly, JYNNEOS/IMVAMUNE is the current most preferable smallpox vaccine that is highly advised for the latest outbreak of human monkeypox but more clinical trials on humans should be conducted to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and adverse events.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Intrinsic exploratory biases are an innate motivation for exploring certain types of stimuli or environments over others, and they may be associated with cognitive, emotional, and even personality-like traits. However, their neurobiological basis has been scarcely investigated. Considering the involvement of the hippocampus in novelty recognition and in spatial and pattern separation tasks, this work researched the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in intrinsic exploratory bias for a perceptually complex object in mice. Spontaneous object preference tasks revealed that both male and female C57BL/6J mice showed a consistent unconditioned preference for exploring “complex”—irregular—objects over simpler ones. Furthermore, increasing objects’ complexity resulted in an augmented time of object exploration. In a different experiment, male mice received either vehicle or the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) for 4 weeks, a pharmacological treatment that reduced AHN as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. After assessment in a behavioral test battery, the TMZ-treated mice did not show any alterations in general exploratory and anxiety-like responses. However, when tested in the spontaneous object preference task, the TMZ-treated mice did not display enhanced exploration of the complex object, as evidenced both by a reduced exploration time—specifically for the complex object—and a lack of preference for the complex object over the simple one. This study supports a novel role of AHN in intrinsic exploratory bias for perceptual complexity. Moreover, the spontaneous complex object preference task as a rodent model of “curiosity” is discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CONGA: Copy number variation genotyping in ancient genomes and low-coverage sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arda Söylev, Sevim Seda Çokoglu, Dilek Koptekin, Can Alkan, Mehmet Somel</p>

To date, ancient genome analyses have been largely confined to the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major contributor of disease and of evolutionary adaptation, but identifying CNVs in ancient shotgun-sequenced genomes is hampered by typical low genome coverage (<1×) and short fragments (<80 bps), precluding standard CNV detection software to be effectively applied to ancient genomes. Here we present CONGA, tailored for genotyping CNVs at low coverage. Simulations and down-sampling experiments suggest that CONGA can genotype deletions >1 kbps with F-scores >0.75 at ≥1×, and distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous states. We used CONGA to genotype 10,002 outgroup-ascertained deletions across a heterogenous set of 71 ancient human genomes spanning the last 50,000 years, produced using variable experimental protocols. A fraction of these (21/71) display divergent deletion profiles unrelated to their population origin, but attributable to technical factors such as coverage and read length. The majority of the sample (50/71), despite originating from nine different laboratories and having coverages ranging from 0.44×-26× (median 4×) and average read lengths 52-121 bps (median 69), exhibit coherent deletion frequencies. Across these 50 genomes, inter-individual genetic diversity measured using SNPs and CONGA-genotyped deletions are highly correlated. CONGA-genotyped deletions also display purifying selection signatures, as expected. CONGA thus paves the way for systematic CNV analyses in ancient genomes, despite the technical challenges posed by low and variable genome coverage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sequence-sensitive elastic network captures dynamical features necessary for miR-125a maturation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivier Mailhot, Vincent Frappier, François Major, Rafael J. Najmanovich</p>

The Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM) is a coarse-grained normal mode analysis (NMA) model unique in its all-atom sensitivity to the sequence of the studied macromolecule and thus to the effect of mutations. We adapted ENCoM to simulate the dynamics of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, benchmarked its performance against other popular NMA models and used it to study the 3D structural dynamics of human microRNA miR-125a, leveraging high-throughput experimental maturation efficiency data of over 26 000 sequence variants. We also introduce a novel way of using dynamical information from NMA to train multivariate linear regression models, with the purpose of highlighting the most salient contributions of dynamics to function. ENCoM has a similar performance profile on RNA than on proteins when compared to the Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), the most widely used coarse-grained NMA model; it has the advantage on predicting large-scale motions while ANM performs better on B-factors prediction. A stringent benchmark from the miR-125a maturation dataset, in which the training set contains no sequence information in common with the testing set, reveals that ENCoM is the only tested model able to capture signal beyond the sequence. This ability translates to better predictive power on a second benchmark in which sequence features are shared between the train and test sets. When training the linear regression model using all available data, the dynamical features identified as necessary for miR-125a maturation point to known patterns but also offer new insights into the biogenesis of microRNAs. Our novel approach combining NMA with multivariate linear regression is generalizable to any macromolecule for which relatively high-throughput mutational data is available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sparse RNNs can support high-capacity classification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Denis Turcu, L. F. Abbott</p>

Feedforward network models performing classification tasks rely on highly convergent output units that collect the information passed on by preceding layers. Although convergent output-unit like neurons may exist in some biological neural circuits, notably the cerebellar cortex, neocortical circuits do not exhibit any obvious candidates for this role; instead they are highly recurrent. We investigate whether a sparsely connected recurrent neural network (RNN) can perform classification in a distributed manner without ever bringing all of the relevant information to a single convergence site. Our model is based on a sparse RNN that performs classification dynamically. Specifically, the interconnections of the RNN are trained to resonantly amplify the magnitude of responses to some external inputs but not others. The amplified and non-amplified responses then form the basis for binary classification. Furthermore, the network acts as an evidence accumulator and maintains its decision even after the input is turned off. Despite highly sparse connectivity, learned recurrent connections allow input information to flow to every neuron of the RNN, providing the basis for distributed computation. In this arrangement, the minimum number of synapses per neuron required to reach maximum memory capacity scales only logarithmically with network size. The model is robust to various types of noise, works with different activation and loss functions and with both backpropagation- and Hebbian-based learning rules. The RNN can also be constructed with a split excitation-inhibition architecture with little reduction in performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpreting tree ensemble machine learning models with endoR</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Albane Ruaud, Niklas Pfister, Ruth E. Ley, Nicholas D. Youngblut</p>

Tree ensemble machine learning models are increasingly used in microbiome science as they are compatible with the compositional, high-dimensional, and sparse structure of sequence-based microbiome data. While such models are often good at predicting phenotypes based on microbiome data, they only yield limited insights into how microbial taxa may be associated. We developed endoR, a method to interpret tree ensemble models. First, endoR simplifies the fitted model into a decision ensemble. Then, it extracts information on the importance of individual features and their pairwise interactions, displaying them as an interpretable network. Both the endoR network and importance scores provide insights into how features, and interactions between them, contribute to the predictive performance of the fitted model. Adjustable regularization and bootstrapping help reduce the complexity and ensure that only essential parts of the model are retained. We assessed endoR on both simulated and real metagenomic data. We found endoR to have comparable accuracy to other common approaches while easing and enhancing model interpretation. Using endoR, we also confirmed published results on gut microbiome differences between cirrhotic and healthy individuals. Finally, we utilized endoR to explore associations between human gut methanogens and microbiome components. Indeed, these hydrogen consumers are expected to interact with fermenting bacteria in a complex syntrophic network. Specifically, we analyzed a global metagenome dataset of 2203 individuals and confirmed the previously reported association between <i>Methanobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Christensenellales</i>. Additionally, we observed that <i>Methanobacteriaceae</i> are associated with a network of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Our method accurately captures how tree ensembles use features and interactions between them to predict a response. As demonstrated by our applications, the resultant visualizations and summary outputs facilitate model interpretation and enable the generation of novel hypotheses about complex systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting peripheral protein-membrane interfaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thibault Tubiana, Ian Sillitoe, Christine Orengo, Nathalie Reuter</p>

Peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs) include a wide variety of proteins that have in common to bind transiently to the chemically complex interfacial region of membranes through their interfacial binding site (IBS). In contrast to protein-protein or protein-DNA/RNA interfaces, peripheral protein-membrane interfaces are poorly characterized. We collected a dataset of PMP domains representative of the variety of PMP functions: membrane-targeting domains (Annexin, C1, C2, discoidin C2, PH, PX), enzymes (PLA, PLC/D) and lipid-transfer proteins (START). The dataset contains 1328 experimental structures and 1194 AphaFold models. We mapped the amino acid composition and structural patterns of the IBS of each protein in this dataset, and evaluated which were more likely to be found at the IBS compared to the rest of the domains’ accessible surface. In agreement with earlier work we find that about two thirds of the PMPs in the dataset have protruding hydrophobes (Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Trp and Met) at their IBS. The three aromatic amino acids Trp, Tyr and Phe are a hallmark of PMPs IBS regardless of whether they protrude on loops or not. This is also the case for lysines but not arginines suggesting that, unlike for Arg-rich membrane-active peptides, the less membrane-disruptive lysine is preferred in PMPs. Another striking observation was the over-representation of glycines at the IBS of PMPs compared to the rest of their surface, possibly procuring IBS loops a much-needed flexibility to insert in-between membrane lipids. The analysis of the 9 superfamilies revealed amino acid distribution patterns in agreement with their known functions and membrane-binding mechanisms. Besides revealing novel amino acids patterns at protein-membrane interfaces, our work contributes a new PMP dataset and an analysis pipeline that can be further built upon for future studies of PMPs properties, or for developing PMPs prediction tools using for example, machine learning approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Members of the majority need to actively promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cody J. Smith</p>

The responsibility for promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) too often falls on scientists from minority groups. Here, I provide a list of potential strategies that members of the majority can easily do to step up and get involved in DEIB.

Interesting in including diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in your lab but not sure how to start? This Perspective speaks to everyone, including those in the "majority", about how to get involved.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">DystoniaBoTXNet: Novel Neural Network Biomarker of Botulinum Toxin Efficacy in Isolated Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated dystonia is characterized by abnormal, often painful, postures and repetitive movements due to sustained or intermittent involuntary muscle contractions. Botulinum toxin (BoTX) injections into the affected muscles are the first line of therapy. However, there are no objective predictive markers or standardized tests of BoTX efficacy that can be utilized for appropriate candidate selection prior to treatment initiation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed a deep learning algorithm, DystoniaBoTXNet, which uses a 3D convolutional neural network architecture and raw structural brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) to automatically discover and test a neural network biomarker of BoTX efficacy in 284 patients with 4 different forms of focal dystonia, including laryngeal dystonia, blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, and writer's cramp.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DystoniaBoTXNet identified clusters in superior parietal lobule, inferior and middle frontal gyri, middle orbital gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and anterior thalamic radiation as components of the treatment biomarker. These regions are known to contribute to both dystonia pathophysiology across a broad clinical spectrum of disorder and the central effects of botulinum toxin treatment. Based on its biomarker, DystoniaBoTXNet achieved an overall accuracy of 96.3%, with 100% sensitivity and 86.1% specificity, in predicting BoTX efficacy in patients with isolated dystonia. The algorithmic decision was computed in 19.2 seconds per case.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DystoniaBoTXNet and its treatment biomarker have a high translational potential as an objective, accurate, generalizable, fast, and cost-effective algorithmic platform for enhancing clinical decision making for BoTX treatment in patients with isolated dystonia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Harassment of game makers: Prevalence and impact [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Online harassment is a relatively commonplace occurrence in the video gaming industry and player communities. A lack of diversity has unquestionably contributed to the high levels of such incidences. Methods: In this paper, we take an exploratory approach, via a cross-sectional observational study, to evaluate the harassment of game industry professionals on social media. In this new sphere of growing concern, there is evidence of significant harm for game makers and their radius of impact. We will discuss the prevalence rates, nature of harassment, and the ways in which a lack of diversity has contributed to this phenomenon. Results: In total, 282 video game industry professionals completed the survey in its entirety. More than half of all participants reported experiencing harassment on social media (59.6%) and nearly all reported witnessing harassment happening to other members of the videogames industry via social media (92.2%). This harassment can have a significant impact on well-being, including increased anxiety (62.1%), feelings of isolation (37.6%) and increased depression (36.2%). Almost one quarter (23.8%) reported symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder. One out of 10 participants reported suicidal thoughts because of online harassment. A significant number of respondents (37.3%) reported that had to take steps to reduce their physical safety due to online harassment. Over half of all respondents saying they were targets of hate because of some aspect of their identity. Conclusions: The results indicate high rates of online harassment, both direct and indirect, among members of the gaming industry at all levels. Responses also pointed to substantial mental health and behavioral impacts of both experiencing and witnessing online harassment. Without large-scale action, this problem will continue to reinforce the lack of diversity inside game studios, pushing out marginalized employees due to a hostile work environment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Seasonal Variation in Neurologic Hospitalizations in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Certain neurologic diseases have been noted to vary by season, and this is important for understanding disease mechanisms and risk factors, but seasonality has not been systematically examined across the spectrum of neurologic disease, and methodologic guidance is also lacking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using nationally representative data from the National Inpatient Sample, a stratified 20% sample of all non-federal acute care hospitalizations in the United States, we calculated the monthly rate of hospitalization for fourteen neurologic diseases from 2016-2018. For each disease, we assessed seasonality of hospitalization using chi-square, Edward, and Walter-Elwood tests and seasonal time series regression models. Statistical tests were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using Bonferroni correction.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Meningitis, encephalitis, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and multiple sclerosis had statistically significant seasonality according to multiple methods of testing. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status epilepticus, myasthenia gravis, and epilepsy had significant seasonality according to Edwards and Walter-Elwood tests but not chi-square tests. Seasonal time series regression illustrated seasonal variation in all fourteen diseases of interest, but statistical testing for seasonality within these models using the Kruskal-Wallis test only achieved statistical significance for meningitis .</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Seasonal variation is present across the spectrum of acute neurologic disease, including some conditions for which seasonality has not previously been described, and can be examined using multiple different methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">A distinct impact of repeated morphine exposure on synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral‐CA1, temporoammonic‐CA1, and perforant pathway‐dentate gyrus synapses along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We aimed to study how morphine affects synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions along the hippocampal long axis. For this, recording and measuring of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were utilized to test the effects of repeated morphine exposure on paired-pulse evoked responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 (Sch-CA1), temporoammonic-CA1 (TA-CA1) and perforant pathway-dentate gyrus (PP-DG) synapses in transverse slices from the dorsal (DH), intermediate (IH), and ventral (VH) hippocampus in adult male rats. After repeated morphine exposure, the expression of opioid receptors and the α1 and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits were also examined. We found that repeated morphine exposure blunt the difference between the DH and the VH in their basal levels of synaptic transmission at Sch-CA1 synapses that were seen in the control groups. Significant paired-pulse facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed at Sch-CA1 synapses in slices taken from all three hippocampal segments as well as at PP-DG synapses in slices taken from the VH segment in the morphine-treated groups as compared to the control groups. Interestingly, significant paired-pulse inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed at TA-CA1 synapses in the DH slices from the morphine-treated group as compared to the control group. While primed-burst stimulation (a protocol reflecting normal neuronal firing) induced a robust LTP in hippocampal subfields in all control groups, resulting in a decaying LTP at TA-CA1 synapses in the VH slices and at PP-DG synapses in both the IH and VH slices taken from the morphine-treated rats. In the DH of morphine-treated rats, we found increased levels of the mRNAs encoding the α1 and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits as compared to the control group. Taken together, these findings suggest the potential mechanisms through which repeated morphine exposure causes differential changes in circuit excitability and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions along the hippocampal long axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gigapixel imaging with a novel multi-camera array microscope</a></h4>

              
                The dynamics of living organisms are organized across many spatial scales. However, current cost-effective imaging systems can measure only a subset of these scales at once. We have created a scalable multi-camera array microscope (MCAM) that enables comprehensive high-resolution recording from multiple spatial scales simultaneously, ranging from structures that approach the cellular scale to large-group behavioral dynamics. By collecting data from up to 96 cameras, we computationally generate gigapixel-scale images and movies with a field of view over hundreds of square centimeters at an optical resolution of 18 µm. This allows us to observe the behavior and fine anatomical features of numerous freely moving model organisms on multiple spatial scales, including larval zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes, carpenter ants, and slime mold. Further, the MCAM architecture allows stereoscopic tracking of the z-position of organisms using the overlapping field of view from adjacent cameras. Overall, by removing the bottlenecks imposed by single-camera image acquisition systems, the MCAM provides a powerful platform for investigating detailed biological features and behavioral processes of small model organisms across a wide range of spatial scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The conserved centrosomin motif, γTuNA, forms a dimer that directly activates microtubule nucleation by the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC)</a></h4>

              
                To establish the microtubule cytoskeleton, the cell must tightly regulate when and where microtubules are nucleated. This regulation involves controlling the initial nucleation template, the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). Although γTuRC is present throughout the cytoplasm, its activity is restricted to specific sites including the centrosome and Golgi. The well-conserved γ-tubulin nucleation activator (γTuNA) domain has been reported to increase the number of microtubules (MTs) generated by γTuRCs. However, previously we and others observed that γTuNA had a minimal effect on the activity of antibody-purified <i>Xenopus</i> γTuRCs <i>in vitro</i> (Thawani et al., <i>eLife</i>, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Here we instead report, based on improved versions of γTuRC, γTuNA, and our TIRF assay, the first real-time observation that γTuNA directly increases γTuRC activity <i>in vitro</i>, which is thus a <i>bona fide</i> γTuRC activator. We further validate this effect in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extract. Via mutation analysis, we find that γTuNA is an obligate dimer. Moreover, efficient dimerization as well as γTuNA's L70, F75, and L77 residues are required for binding to and activation of γTuRC. Finally, we find that γTuNA's activating effect opposes inhibitory regulation by stathmin. In sum, our improved assays prove that direct γTuNA binding strongly activates γTuRCs, explaining previously observed effects of γTuNA expression in cells and illuminating how γTuRC-mediated microtubule nucleation is regulated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Homeostatic regulation through strengthening of neuronal network-correlated synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic regulation is essential for stable neuronal function. Several synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity have been described, but the functional properties of synapses involved in homeostasis are unknown. We used longitudinal two-photon functional imaging of dendritic spine calcium signals in visual and retrosplenial cortices of awake adult mice to quantify the sensory deprivation-induced changes in the responses of functionally identified spines. We found that spines whose activity selectively correlated with intrinsic network activity underwent TNF-α dependent homeostatic increases in their response amplitudes, but spines identified as responsive to sensory stimulation did not. We observed an increase in the global sensory-evoked responses following sensory deprivation, despite the fact that the identified sensory inputs did not strengthen. Instead, global sensory-evoked responses correlated with the strength of network-correlated inputs. Our results suggest that homeostatic regulation of global responses is mediated through changes to intrinsic network-correlated inputs rather than changes to identified sensory inputs thought to drive sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A coordinated transcriptional switching network mediates antigenic variation of human malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                Malaria parasites avoid immune clearance through their ability to systematically alter antigens exposed on the surface of infected red blood cells. This is accomplished by tightly regulated transcriptional control of individual members of a large, multicopy gene family called <i>var</i> and is the key to both the virulence and chronic nature of malaria infections. Expression of <i>var</i> genes is mutually exclusive and controlled epigenetically, however how large populations of parasites coordinate <i>var</i> gene switching to avoid premature exposure of the antigenic repertoire is unknown. Here we provide evidence for a transcriptional network anchored by a universally conserved gene called <i>var2csa</i> that coordinates the switching process. We describe a structured switching bias that shifts overtime and could shape the pattern of <i>var</i> expression over the course of a lengthy infection. Our results provide an explanation for a previously mysterious aspect of malaria infections and shed light on how parasites possessing a relatively small repertoire of variant antigen encoding genes can coordinate switching events to limit antigen exposure, thereby maintaining chronic infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Injured Sciatic Nerve Atlas (iSNAT), insights into the cellular and molecular basis of neural tissue degeneration and regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Upon trauma, the adult murine PNS displays a remarkable degree of spontaneous anatomical and functional regeneration. To explore extrinsic mechanisms of neural repair, we carried out single cell analysis of naïve mouse sciatic nerve, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and crushed sciatic nerves at 1-day, 3-days, and 7- days following injury. During the first week, monocytes and macrophages (Mo/Mac) rapidly accumulate in the injured nerve and undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming. Proinflammatory Mo/Mac in the injured nerve show high glycolytic flux compared to Mo/Mac in blood and dominate the early injury response. They subsequently give way to inflammation resolving Mac, programmed toward oxidative phosphorylation. Nerve crush injury causes partial leakiness of the blood-nerve-barrier, proliferation of endoneurial and perineurial stromal cells, and accumulation of select serum proteins. Micro-dissection of the nerve injury site and distal nerve, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing, identified distinct immune compartments, triggered by mechanical nerve wounding and Wallerian degeneration, respectively. This finding was independently confirmed with Sarm1-/- mice, where Wallerian degeneration is greatly delayed. Experiments with chimeric mice showed that wildtype immune cells readily enter the injury site in Sarm1-/- mice, but are sparse in the distal nerve, except for Mo. We used CellChat to explore intercellular communications in the naïve and injured PNS and report on hundreds of ligand-receptor interactions. Our longitudinal analysis represents a new resource for nerve regeneration, reveals location specific immune microenvironments, and reports on large intercellular communication networks. To facilitate mining of scRNAseq datasets, we generated the injured sciatic nerve atlas (iSNAT): https://cdb-rshiny.med.umich.edu/Giger_iSNAT/

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A remarkable adaptive paradigm of heart performance and protection emerges in response to the constitutive challenge of marked cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase type 8</a></h4>

              
                Adult (3 month) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase (AC) type VIII (TG<sup>AC8</sup>) adapt to an increased cAMP-induced cardiac workload (~30% increases in heart rate, ejection fraction and cardiac output) for up to a year without signs of heart failure or excessive mortality. Here, we show classical cardiac hypertrophy markers were absent in TG<sup>AC8</sup>, and that total left ventricular (LV) mass was not increased: a reduced LV cavity volume in TG<sup>AC8</sup> was encased by thicker LV walls harboring an increased number of small cardiac myocytes, and a network of small interstitial proliferative non-cardiac myocytes compared to wild type (WT) littermates; Protein synthesis, proteosome activity, and autophagy were enhanced in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT, and Nrf-2, Hsp90α, and ACC2 protein levels were increased. Despite increased energy demands <i>in vivo</i> LV ATP and phosphocreatine levels in TG<sup>AC8</sup> did not differ from WT. Unbiased omics analyses identified more than 2,000 transcripts and proteins, comprising a broad array of biological processes across multiple cellular compartments, which differed by genotype; compared to WT, in TG<sup>AC8</sup> there was a shift from fatty acid oxidation to aerobic glycolysis in the context of increased utilization of the pentose phosphate shunt and nucleotide synthesis. Thus, marked overexpression of AC8 engages complex, coordinate adaptation 'circuity' that has evolved in mammalian cells to defend against stress that threatens health or life (elements of which have already been shown to be central to cardiac ischemic pre-conditioning and exercise endurance cardiac conditioning) that may be of biological significance to allow for proper healing in disease states such as infarction or failure of the heart.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinoic acid-gated BDNF synthesis in neuronal dendrites drives presynaptic homeostatic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a non-Hebbian synaptic mechanism that adjusts synaptic strength to maintain network stability while achieving optimal information processing. Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RARα, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RARα regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at mouse glutamatertic synapses. We show that RARα binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates a RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at the presynaptic site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The missing link between genetic association and regulatory function</a></h4>

              
                The genetic basis of most traits is highly polygenic and dominated by non-coding alleles. It is widely assumed that such alleles exert small regulatory effects on the expression of <i>cis</i>-linked genes. However, despite the availability of gene expression and epigenomic data sets, few variant-to-gene links have emerged. It is unclear whether these sparse results are due to limitations in available data and methods, or to deficiencies in the underlying assumed model. To better distinguish between these possibilities, we identified 220 gene-trait pairs in which protein-coding variants influence a complex trait or its Mendelian cognate. Despite the presence of expression quantitative trait loci near most GWAS associations, by applying a gene-based approach we found limited evidence that the baseline expression of trait-related genes explains GWAS associations, whether using colocalization methods (8% of genes implicated), transcription-wide association (2% of genes implicated), or a combination of regulatory annotations and distance (4% of genes implicated). These results contradict the hypothesis that most complex trait-associated variants coincide with homeostatic eQTLs, suggesting that better models are needed. The field must confront this deficit, and pursue this 'missing regulation'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Piezo1 as a force-through-membrane sensor in red blood cells</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is the stretch activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in red blood cells that mediates homeostatic volume control. Here, we study the organization of Piezo1 in red blood cells using a combination of super-resolution microscopy techniques and electron microscopy. Piezo1 adopts a non-uniform distribution on the red blood cell surface, with a bias toward the biconcave ‘dimple’. Trajectories of diffusing Piezo1 molecules, which exhibit confined Brownian diffusion on short timescales and hopping on long timescales, also reflect a bias toward the dimple. This bias can be explained by ‘curvature coupling’ between the intrinsic curvature of the Piezo dome and the curvature of the red blood cell membrane. Piezo1 does not form clusters with itself, nor does it colocalize with F-actin, Spectrin, or the Gardos channel. Thus, Piezo1 exhibits the properties of a force-through-membrane sensor of curvature and lateral tension in the red blood cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The regional distribution of resident immune cells shapes distinct immunological environments along the murine epididymis</a></h4>

              
                The epididymis functions as transition zone for post-testicular sperm maturation and storage and faces contrasting immunological challenges, i.e. tolerance towards spermatozoa vs. reactivity against pathogens. Thus, normal organ function and integrity relies heavily on a tightly controlled immune balance. Previous studies described inflammation-associated tissue damage solely in the distal regions (corpus, cauda), but not in the proximal regions (initial segment, caput). To understand the observed region-specific immunity along the epididymal duct, we have used an acute bacterial epididymitis mouse model and analyzed the disease progression. Whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq 10 days post infection showed a pro-inflammatory environment within the cauda, while the caput exhibited only minor transcriptional changes. High-dimensional flow cytometry analyses revealed drastic changes in the immune cell composition upon infection with uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i>. A massive influx of neutrophils and monocytes was observed exclusively in distal regions and was associated with bacterial appearance and tissue alterations. In order to clarify the reasons for the region-specific differences in the intensity of immune responses, we investigated the heterogeneity of resident immune cell populations under physiological conditions by scRNASeq analysis of extravascular CD45+ cells. Twelve distinct immune cell subsets were identified, displaying substantial differences in distribution along the epididymis as further assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Macrophages constituted the majority of resident immune cells and were further separated in distinct subgroups based on their transcriptional profile, tissue location and monocyte-dependence. Crucially, the proximal and distal regions showed striking differences in their immunological landscapes. These findings indicate that resident immune cells are strategically positioned along the epididymal duct, potentially providing different immunological environments required for addressing the contrasting immunological challenges and thus, preserving tissue integrity and organ function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuit-wide analysis of gene expression during deafening-induced destabilization ofbirdsong</a></h4>

              
                Sensory feedback is required for stable execution of learned motor skills, and its loss can severely disrupt motor performance. The neural mechanisms that mediate sensorimotor stability have been extensively studied at systems and physiological levels, yet relatively little is known about how disruptions to sensory input alter the molecular properties of associated motor systems. Songbird courtship song, a model for skilled behavior, is a learned and highly structured vocalization that is destabilized following deafening. Here, we sought to determine how the loss of auditory feedback modifies gene expression and its coordination across the birdsong sensorimotor circuit. To facilitate this system-wide analysis of transcriptional responses, we developed a gene expression profiling approach that enables the construction of hundreds of spatially-defined RNA-sequencing libraries. Using this method, we found that deafening preferentially alters gene expression across birdsong neural circuitry relative to surrounding areas, particularly in premotor and striatal regions. Genes with altered expression are associated with synaptic transmission, neuronal spines, and neuromodulation and show a bias toward expression in glutamatergic neurons and Pvalb/Sst-class GABAergic interneurons. We also found that connected song regions exhibit correlations in gene expression that were reduced in deafened birds relative to hearing birds, suggesting that song destabilization alters the inter-region coordination of transcriptional state. Finally, lesioning LMAN, a forebrain afferent of RA required for deafening-induced song plasticity, had the largest effect on groups of genes that were also most affected by deafening. Combined, this integrated transcriptomics analysis demonstrates that the loss of peripheral sensory input drives a distributed gene expression response throughout associated sensorimotor neural circuitry and identifies specific candidate molecular and cellular mechanisms that support stability and plasticity of learned motor skills.

	<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of simple jaw opening and closing task of chewing movements on the activities of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from the viewpoint of stress reduction. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the PFC during a block-tapping task of the jaw in healthy participants. Eleven young healthy individuals with normal dentition (7 males and 4 females, mean age 28.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.7 years) volunteered for this study. CBF was measured using a wearable, functional near-infrared spectroscopy device. Measurements were taken using the central incisors and first molars at interocclusal distances of 5 and 10 mm. The participants were asked to bite a hard/soft block. CBF in all conditions showed limited variability or decreasing trend compared to resting state before the task. The main effect was observed for interocclusal distance (p = 0.008), and there were no significant differences for measurement area of the PFC, tooth type, and material type. An interaction was found between tooth type and material type. In conclusion, these results suggest that simple and rhythmical chewing motion has an effect of reducing CBF in the PFC and resting the PFC, which is an especially notable aspect of periodontal sensory information in the molar.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Individual real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI NF) might be a promising adjuvant in treating depressive symptoms. Further studies showed functional variations and connectivity-related changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the insular cortex. Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether individualized connectivity-based rtfMRI NF training can improve symptoms in depressed patients as an adjunct to a psychotherapeutic programme. The novel strategy chosen for this was to increase connectivity between individualized regions of interest, namely the insula and the dlPFC. Methods: Sixteen patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, ICD-10) and 19 matched healthy controls (HC) participated in a rtfMRI NF training consisting of two sessions with three runs each, within an interval of one week. RtfMRI NF was applied during a sequence of negative emotional pictures to modulate the connectivity between the dlPFC and the insula. The MDD REAL group was divided into a Responder and a Non-Responder group. Patients with an increased connectivity during the second NF session or during both the first and the second NF session were identified as &amp;amp;ldquo;MDD REAL Responder&amp;amp;rdquo; (N = 6). Patients that did not show any increase in connectivity and/or a decreased connectivity were identified as &amp;amp;ldquo;MDD REAL Non-Responder&amp;amp;rdquo; (N = 7). Results: Before the rtfMRI sessions, patients with MDD showed higher neural activation levels in ventromedial PFC and the insula than HC; by contrast, HC revealed increased hemodynamic activity in visual processing areas (primary visual cortex and visual association cortex) compared to patients with MDD. The comparison of hemodynamic responses during the first compared to during the last NF session demonstrated significantly increased BOLD-activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) in patients and HC, and additionally in the lateral OFC in patients with MDD. These findings were particularly due to the MDD Responder group, as the MDD Non-Responder group showed no increase in this region during the last NF run. There was a decrease of neural activation in emotional processing brain regions in both groups in the last NF run compared to the first: HC showed differences in the insula, parahippocampal gyrus, basal ganglia, and cingulate gyrus. Patients with MDD demonstrated deceased responses in the parahippocampal gyrus. There was no significant reduction of BDI scores after NF training in patients. Conclusions: Increased neural activation in the insula and vmPFC in MDD suggests an increased emotional reaction in patients with MDD. The activation of the mOFC could be associated with improved control-strategies and association-learning processes. The increased lOFC activation could indicate a stronger sensitivity to failed NF attempts in MDD. A stronger involvement of visual processing areas in HC may indicate better adaptation to negative emotional stimuli after repeated presentation. Overall, the rtfMRI NF had an impact on neurobiological mechanisms, but not on psychometric measures in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>Aim: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to evaluate the incidence of cranial ultrasound abnormalities (CUAs) amongst moderate to late preterm (MLPT) and term infants, affected by fetal growth restriction (FGR) or those classified as small for gestational age (SGA). Methods: A systematic review methodology was performed, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was utilised. Descriptive and observational studies reporting cranial ultrasound outcomes on FGR/SGA MLPT and term infants were included. Primary outcomes reported was incidence of CUAs in MLPT and term infants affected by FGR or SGA, with secondary outcomes including brain structure development and growth, and cerebral artery Dopplers. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for case&amp;amp;ndash;control and cohort studies, and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for studies reporting prevalence data. GRADE was used to assess for certainty of evidence. Results: Out of a total of 2085 studies identified through the search, seventeen were deemed to be relevant and included. Nine studies assessed CUAs in MLPT FGR/SGA infants, seven studies assessed CUAs in late preterm and term FGR/SGA infants, and one study assessed CUAs in both MLPT and term FGR/SGA infants. The incidence of CUAs in MLPT, and late preterm to term FGR/SGA infants ranged from 0.4 to 33% and 0 to 70%, respectively. A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving 168,136 infants showed an increased risk of any CUA in FGR infants compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants (RR 1.96, [95% CI 1.26&amp;amp;ndash;3.04], I2 = 68%). The certainty of evidence was very low due to non-randomised studies, methodological limitations, and heterogeneity. Another meta-analysis looking at 4 studies with 167,060 infants showed an increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage in FGR/SGA infants compared to AGA infants (RR 2.40, [95% CI 2.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.84], I2 = 0%). This was also of low certainty. Conclusions: The incidence of CUAs in MLPT and term growth-restricted infants varied widely between studies. Findings from the meta-analyses suggest the risk of CUAs and IVH may indeed be increased in these FGR/SGA infants when compared with infants not affected by FGR, however the evidence is of low to very low certainty. Further specific cohort studies are needed to fully evaluate the benefits and prognostic value of cranial ultrasonography to ascertain the need for, and timing of a cranial ultrasound screening protocol in this infant population, along with follow-up studies to ascertain the significance of CUAs identified.</p>

	<p>P3b is an event-related potential (ERP) that may be abnormal in patients with tic disorders (TD), but evidence has been inconsistent. Given the possible association between P3b and TD and the need for biomarkers for TD, the primary objective of this meta-analysis was to characterize P3b in patients with TD in comparison to healthy controls (HCs). Methods: By searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Medline, and Google Scholar, we identified studies that compared P3b between TD patients and HCs. The amplitude and latency of P3b were then analyzed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of different experimental factors on P3b indices. Result: Overall, 19 articles involving 388 cases and 414 controls were evaluated. There were no significant abnormalities in P3b amplitude and latency in TD patients. The P3b amplitude of the TD patients was significantly decreased during the oddball task, and the P3b amplitude of the adult TD patients was also significantly decreased. Conclusion: TD patients may have an abnormal P3b compared to HCs under specified conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Beyond tradition: using systemic functional linguistics in TED talks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is an internationally based open access platform where professionals from various fields are invited to give speeches, and to share ideas with like-minded people. In recent years, topics related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or the COVID-19 pandemic have become the most popular speech topics on TED. This paper selects speech-related topics on TED during the pandemic, by using systemic functional linguistics to study how discourses are expressed on the platform. Unlike traditional textual analyses, content on TED are normally verbalized, requiring original texts to be presented in an understandable format. As a result, this paper focuses on the functional innovation of new forms of expression on TED. In other words, the functional perspective of the presentation in relation to COVID-19 based topics may rely on the explanation of the meta-meaning of the keywords, posting images and other techniques as auxiliary means for expression, to some extent. These auxiliary techniques offer traditional systemic functional linguistics new meanings in terms of ideational and interpersonal aspects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community-based case studies of vaccine hesitancy and the COVID-19 response in South Africa - study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In 2021 the South African government launched a large COVID-19 immunization campaign with the goal of reaching more than 40 million individuals. Nonetheless, certain international largely internet-based surveys at the time showed a significant proportion of vaccine hesitancy in South Africa. This study aims to determine and co-create with local stakeholders a comprehensive understanding of vaccine hesitancy and opportunities to support the promotion of other COVID-19 health-promoting behaviours at community level. Methods: A mixed-methods multiple case-study design; informed by the socio-ecological model of behaviour change. Four socio-economically diverse communities across South Africa will be selected and data collection will take place concurrently through three iterative phases. Phase 1 will provide insights into community experiences of COVID-19 (response) through desktop mapping exercises, observations, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions (FGDs) designed as expression sessions with local stakeholders. Phase 2 will explore the extent and drivers of community acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. This phase will comprise a survey based on WHO’s Behavioural and Social Drivers of Vaccination tool as well as further FGDs with community members. Phase 3 will involve cross-case study syntheses and presentation of findings to national role-players. Discussion: This study will provide ground up, locally responsive, and timeous evidence on the factors influencing COVID-19 health-seeking behaviours to inform ongoing management and mitigation of COVID-19 in South Africa. It will also provide insights into the applicability of a novel vaccine hesitancy model in Africa.

                Background: Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy in MRSA infection, however, achieving an appropriate serum concentration is challenging. Population pharmacokinetics can assist the clinician in the selection of better regimen dosing and improve effectiveness and safety outcomes. Methods: This scoping review aims to outline the evidence in population pharmacokinetic models in non-critical adults hospitalized from 1980 to 2021 and describe the principal software and covariables used in this. A total of 209 papers were fully screened. Finally, we included 17 articles conducted in different locations around the world. Results: This review identified 13 retrospective articles and 4 prospective, 5 describing the use in a general population with gram-positive bacterial infection, 11 evaluated special populations (older, obese, and cancer patients), and 1 mixed population. The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies use internal validation methods, and three of them used an external validation group. This scoping review highlights the principal information of different population pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and methods of evaluation. Conclusions: These methods can be used to guide the dosing regimen in different subpopulations. However, it is imperative to define the best fit in every population and conduct an experiment due to the high variability in the present studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma amine profiles in interictal migraine</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impaired amine metabolism has been associated with the etiology of migraine, i.e. why patients continue to get migraine attacks. However, evidence from CSF is lacking. Here we evaluated individual amine levels, global amine profiles and amine pathways in CSF and plasma of interictal migraine patients and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>CSF and plasma were sampled between 08:30 and 13:00, randomly and interchangeably over the time span to avoid any diurnal and seasonal influences, from healthy volunteers and interictal migraine patients, matched for age, sex and sampling time. The study was approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee. Individual amines (n=31), global amine profiles, and specific amine pathways were analyzed using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed n=99 participants with migraine with aura, n=98 with migraine without aura, and n=96 healthy volunteers. Univariate analysis with Bonferroni correction indicated that CSF L-Arginine was reduced in migraine with aura (10.4%; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and without aura (5.0%; <i>p</i>=0.03). False discovery rate corrected CSF L-Phenylalanine was also lower in migraine with aura (6.9%; <i>p</i>=0.011) and without aura (8.1%; <i>p</i>=0.001; <i>p</i>=0.088 after Bonferroni correction). Multivariate analysis revealed that CSF global amine profiles were similar for both types of migraine (<i>p</i>=0.64), but distinct from controls (<i>p</i>=0.009). Global profile analyses were similar in plasma. Strongest associated pathways with migraine were related to L-Arginine metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>L-Arginine was decreased in the CSF (but not in plasma) of interictal patients with migraine with or without aura, and associated pathways were altered. This suggests that dysfunction of nitric oxide signaling is involved in susceptibility to getting migraine attacks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Limbic connectivity underlies pain treatment response in small‐fiber neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is characterized by neuropathic pain due to degeneration of small-diameter nerves in the skin. Given that brain reorganization occurs following chronic neuropathic pain, this study investigated the structural and functional basis of pain-related brain changes after skin nerve degeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 53 pathologically confirmed SFN patients, and the structural and functional connectivity of the pain-related network was assessed using network-based statistic (NBS) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, the SFN patients exhibited a robust and global reduction of functional connectivity, mainly across the limbic and somatosensory systems. Furthermore, lower functional connectivity was associated with skin nerve degeneration measured by reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and better therapeutic response to anti-neuralgia medications, particularly for the connectivity between the insula and the limbic areas including the anterior and middle cingulate cortices. Similar to the patterns of functional connectivity changes, the structural connectivity was robustly reduced among the limbic and somatosensory areas, and the cognition-integration areas including the inferior parietal lobule. There was shared reduction of structural and functional connectivity among the limbic, somatosensory, striatal, and cognition-integration systems: (1) between the middle cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule and (2) between the thalamus and putamen. These observations indicate the structural basis underlying altered functional connectivity in SFN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide imaging evidence linking structural and functional brain dysconnectivity to sensory deafferentation caused by peripheral nerve degeneration and therapeutic responses for neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of the evolution of resistance to multiple antibiotics enables prediction of the Escherichia coli phenotype-based fitness landscape</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junichiro Iwasawa, Tomoya Maeda, Atsushi Shibai, Hazuki Kotani, Masako Kawada, Chikara Furusawa</p>

The fitness landscape represents the complex relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness under a given environment, the structure of which allows the explanation and prediction of evolutionary trajectories. Although previous studies have constructed fitness landscapes by comprehensively studying the mutations in specific genes, the high dimensionality of genotypic changes prevents us from developing a fitness landscape capable of predicting evolution for the whole cell. Herein, we address this problem by inferring the phenotype-based fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance evolution by quantifying the multidimensional phenotypic changes, i.e., time-series data of resistance for eight different drugs. We show that different peaks of the landscape correspond to different drug resistance mechanisms, thus supporting the validity of the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape. We further discuss how inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes could contribute to the prediction and control of evolution. This approach bridges the gap between phenotypic/genotypic changes and fitness while contributing to a better understanding of drug resistance evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">APOE alleles are associated with sex-specific structural differences in brain regions affected in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chloé Savignac, Sylvia Villeneuve, AmanPreet Badhwar, Karin Saltoun, Kimia Shafighi, Chris Zajner, Vaibhav Sharma, Sarah A. Gagliano Taliun, Sali Farhan, Judes Poirier, Danilo Bzdok</p>

Alzheimer’s disease is marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we examined codependent structural variations between the MTL’s most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the DN at subregion resolution in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). By leveraging the power of the approximately 40,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we assessed impacts from the protective <i>APOE</i> ɛ2 and the deleterious <i>APOE</i> ɛ4 Alzheimer’s disease alleles on these structural relationships. We demonstrate ɛ2 and ɛ4 genotype effects on the inter-individual expression of HC-DN co-variation structural patterns at the population level. Across these HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix’s fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Analyses of the rich phenotypic profiles in the UK Biobank cohort further revealed male-specific HC-DN associations with air pollution and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We also showed that <i>APOE</i> ɛ2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our structural, genetic, and phenotypic analyses in this large epidemiological cohort reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between <i>APOE</i> ɛ2 dosage and sex and link <i>APOE</i> alleles to inter-individual brain structural differences indicative of ADRD familial risk.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Illusory responses across the Lewy body disease spectrum</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To study pareidolias, or perceived meaningful objects in a meaningless stimulus, in patients across the Lewy body (LB) disease spectrum, where most do not report hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in 300 participants [38 cognitively-impaired LB, 65 cognitively-unimpaired LB, 51 Alzheimer's disease-spectrum (AD-s), 146 Controls]. Pairwise between-group comparisons examined how diagnosis impacts the number of illusory responses. Ordinal regression analysis compared the number of illusory responses across diagnosis groups, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Analyses were repeated after removing participants with reported hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cognitively-impaired LB participants were 12.3, 4.9, and 4.6 times more likely than Control, cognitively-unimpaired LB, and AD-s participants, respectively, to endorse illusory responses. After adjusting for age, sex and education, the probability of endorsing one or more illusory response was 61% in the cognitively-impaired LB group, compared to 26% in AD-s, 25% in cognitively-unimpaired LB, and 12% in Control participants. All results were similar after repeated analysis only in participants without hallucinations or delusions. In LB without hallucinations or delusions, 52% with mild cognitive impairment and 66.7% with dementia endorsed at least one illusory response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found illusory responses are common in cognitively impaired LB patients, including those without any reported psychosis. Our data suggest that, prior to the onset of hallucinations and delusions, the Noise Pareidolia Task can easily be used to screen for unobtrusive pareidolias in all LB patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Clinically meaningful MR endpoints sensitive to preataxic SCA1 and SCA3</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify MR metrics that are most sensitive to early changes in the brain in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and type 3 (SCA3) using an advanced multi-modal MRI protocol in the multi-site trial setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SCA1 or SCA3 mutation carriers and controls (<i>n</i>=107) underwent MR scanning in the US-European READISCA study to obtain structural, diffusion MRI and MR spectroscopy data using an advanced protocol at 3T. Morphometric, microstructural, and neurochemical metrics were analyzed blinded to diagnosis and compared between preataxic (<i>n</i>=11 SCA1, 28 SCA3), ataxic (<i>n</i>=14 SCA1, 37 SCA3) SCA and control (<i>n</i>=17) groups using non-parametric testing accounting for multiple comparisons. MR metrics that were most sensitive to preataxic abnormalities were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Atrophy and microstructural damage in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles and neurochemical abnormalities in the pons were prominent in both preataxic groups, when patients did not differ from controls clinically. MR metrics were strongly associated with ataxia symptoms, activities of daily living and estimated ataxia duration. A neurochemical measure was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA1 (ROC area under the curve (AUC) =0.95) and a microstructural metric was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA3 (AUC =0.92).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Changes in cerebellar afferent and efferent pathways underlie the earliest symptoms of both SCAs. MR metrics collected with a harmonized advanced protocol in the multi-site trial setting allow detecting disease effects in individuals before ataxia onset with potential clinical trial utility for subject stratification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Ludwig's angina - 'The Dangerous Space' [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Areas of research interest: joining the dots between government and research at last? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: With the aim of making it easier for researchers to produce policy-relevant research, the UK Government now requires all departments and arms-length bodies to publish annually-updated statements of their evidence needs, called ‘Areas of Research Interest’ (ARIs).  We describe how ARIs are produced, and how they are used to support this aim. Aims and objectives: In this paper we offer a description of ARIs and their development by UK governmental departments, and an assessment of how different stakeholders, including academia and funders, have responded to or otherwise used the ARIs. Key conclusions: ARIs are a mechanism for organisations to share their research interests with external audiences in the form of a published document. In addition to this primary aim, they also have a much broader set of uses, including connecting departments with each other and helping intermediaries shape engagement plans. All groups would benefit from more robust evidence to choose effective engagement mechanisms, and more can be done to make the ARIs discoverable and useable. Overall, the ARIs are a useful tool to illuminate, and begin to connect different parts of the research-policy system.
