              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24029">Improved Accuracy of Robot Localization Using 3-D LiDAR in a Hippocampus-Inspired Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24647">Quantifying the Effects of Word Length, Frequency, and Predictability on Dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709">Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21142">Multimodal Dreaming: A Global Workspace Approach to World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.21142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04536">NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20958">NeuroPilot: A Realtime Brain-Computer Interface system to enhance concentration of students in online learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23781">Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rates for Deep Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is highly adaptive: its functional connectivity reconfigures on multiple timescales during cognition and learning, enabling flexible information processing. By contrast, artificial neural networks typically rely on manually-tuned learning-rate schedules or generic adaptive optimizers whose hyperparameters remain largely agnostic to a model's internal dynamics. In this paper, we propose Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rate (CG-ALR) that dynamically constructs a functional connectome of the neural network from neuron co-activations at each training iteration and adjusts learning rates online as this connectome reconfigures. This connectomics-inspired mechanism adapts step sizes to the network's dynamic functional organization, slowing learning during unstable reconfiguration and accelerating it when stable organization emerges. Our results demonstrate that principles inspired by brain connectomes can inform the design of adaptive learning rates in deep learning, generally outperforming traditional SGD-based schedules and recent methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24637">All in one timestep: Enhancing Sparsity and Energy efficiency in Multi-level Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However, the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to 3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures. Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.

Abstract: We present a novel algorithm, \hdgc, that marries graph convolution with binding and bundling operations in hyperdimensional computing for transductive graph learning. For prediction accuracy \hdgc outperforms major and popular graph neural network implementations as well as state-of-the-art hyperdimensional computing implementations for a collection of homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs. Compared with the most accurate learning methodologies we have tested, on the same target GPU platform, \hdgc is on average 9561.0 and 144.5 times faster than \gcnii, a graph neural network implementation and HDGL, a hyperdimensional computing implementation, respectively. As the majority of the learning operates on binary vectors, we expect outstanding energy performance of \hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging process-in-memory devices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013">Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839">Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.

                arXiv:2405.08871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement Genetic Algorithms for triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes which induce Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces via Batyrev's construction. We demonstrate that such algorithms efficiently optimize physical observables such as axion decay constants or axion-photon couplings in string theory compactifications. For our implementation, we choose a parameterization of triangulations that yields homotopy inequivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds by extending fine, regular triangulations of two-faces, thereby eliminating exponentially large redundancy factors in the map from polytope triangulations to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In particular, we discuss how this encoding renders the entire Kreuzer-Skarke list amenable to a variety of optimization strategies, including but not limited to Genetic Algorithms. To achieve optimal performance, we tune the hyperparameters of our Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian optimization. We find that our implementation vastly outperforms other sampling and optimization strategies like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Simulated Annealing. Finally, we showcase that our Genetic Algorithm efficiently performs optimization even for the maximal polytope with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1} = 491$, where we use it to maximize axion-photon couplings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13898">Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1, Qwen 3, and OLMo 2 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.

                arXiv:2507.18868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with systematic compositional generalization, a hallmark of human cognition. We propose \textsc{Mirage}, a neuro-inspired dual-process model that offers a processing account for this ability. It combines a fast, intuitive ``System~1'' (a meta-trained Transformer) with a deliberate, rule-based ``System~2'' (a Schema Engine), mirroring the brain's neocortical and hippocampal--prefrontal circuits. Trained to perform general, single-step decomposition on a stream of random grammars, Mirage achieves $>$99\% accuracy on all splits of the SCAN benchmark in a task-agnostic setting. Ablations confirm that the model's systematic behavior emerges from the architectural interplay of its two systems, particularly its use of explicit, prioritized schemas and iterative refinement. In line with recent progress on recursive/recurrent Transformer approaches, Mirage preserves an iterative neural update while externalizing declarative control into an interpretable schema module. Our work provides a concrete computational model for interpreting how compositional reasoning can arise from a modular cognitive architecture.

                <p>Loss-of-function (LOF) Frazzled/DCC mutants disrupt synaptogenesis in the Giant Fiber (GF) System of <I>Drosophila</I>. We observed weaker physiology in LOF male and female specimens, characterized by longer latencies and reduced response frequencies between the GFs and the motor neurons. These physiological phenotypes are linked to a loss of gap junctions in the GFs, specifically the loss of the shaking-B(neural+16) isoform of innexin in the presynaptic terminal. We present evidence of Frazzled's role in gap junction regulation by utilizing the UAS-GAL4 system in <I>Drosophila</I> to rescue mutant phenotypes. Expression of various UAS-Frazzled constructs in a Frazzled LOF background was used to dissect the role of different parts of the Frazzled receptor in the assembly of electrical synapses. Expressing Frazzled&rsquo;s intracellular domain in Frazzled LOF mutants rescued axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis. This is supported by the complementary result that Frazzled fails to rescue synaptic function when the transcriptional activation domain is disrupted, as shown by the deletion of the highly conserved intracellular P3 domain or by a construct with a point mutation in the highly conserved P3 domain known to be required for transcriptional activation. A computational model clarifies the role of gap junctions and the function of the GF System. The present work shows how various domains of a guidance molecule regulate synaptogenesis through the regulation of synaptic components.</p>

                <p>Sleep&ndash;wake states bidirectionally interact with epilepsy and seizures, but the mechanisms are unknown. A barrier to comprehensive characterization and the study of mechanisms has been the difficulty of annotating large chronic recording datasets. To overcome this barrier, we sought to develop an automated method of classifying sleep&ndash;wake states, seizures, and the postictal state in mice ranging from controls to mice with severe epilepsy with accompanying background electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities. We utilized a large dataset of recordings, including electromyogram, EEG, and hippocampal local field potentials, from control and intra-amygdala kainic acid-treated mice. We found that an existing sleep&ndash;wake classifier performed poorly, even after retraining. A support vector machine, relying on typically used scoring parameters, also performed below our benchmark. We then trained and evaluated several multilayer neural network architectures and found that a bidirectional long short-term memory&ndash;based model performed best. This "Sleep&ndash;Wake and Ictal State Classifier" (SWISC) showed high agreement between ground-truth and classifier scores for all sleep and seizure states in an unseen and unlearned epileptic dataset (average agreement 96.41% &plusmn; SD 3.80%) and saline animals (97.77 &plusmn; 1.40%). Channel dropping showed that SWISC was primarily dependent on hippocampal signals yet still maintained good performance (~90% agreement) with EEG alone, thereby expanding the classifier's applicability to other epilepsy datasets. SWISC enables the efficient combined scoring of sleep&ndash;wake and seizure states in mouse models of epilepsy and healthy controls, facilitating comprehensive and mechanistic studies of sleep&ndash;wake and biological rhythms in epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Thirst is a strongly motivated internal state that is represented in central brain circuits that are only partially understood. Water seeking is a discrete step of the thirst behavioral sequence that is amenable to uncovering the mechanisms for motivational properties such as goal-oriented behavior, value encoding, and behavioral competition. In <I>Drosophila</I>, water seeking is regulated by the NPY-like neuropeptide NPF; however, the circuitry for NPF-dependent water seeking is unknown. To uncover the downstream circuitry, we identified the NPF receptor NPFR and the neurons it is expressed in as being acutely critical for thirsty water seeking in males. Refinement of the NPFR pattern uncovered a role for a single neuron, the L1-l, in promoting thirsty water seeking. The L1-l neuron increases its activity in thirsty flies and is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurons in long-term memory formation. Thus, NPFR and its ligand NPF, already known for its role in feeding behavior, are also important for a second ingestive behavior.</p>

                <p>The ability to inhibit and adapt our behavior in response to changing stimuli is a critical component of everyday life. Individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) may struggle to inhibit behavior, particularly in the presence of dopaminergic therapy, which can result in impulsive behavior. Impulse control disorders are often operationalized in the laboratory using motor inhibition tasks. However, deficits of motor inhibition tasks are not always observed in PD, perhaps because of the nature of the motor inhibition that is engaged in typical tasks (e.g., suppression of incipient movement such as a button press). We employed a novel continuous movement stop task to investigate planned and unplanned motor inhibition during ongoing movement. EEG was recorded during task performance from individuals with PD (OFF and ON dopaminergic medication) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Participants were of any sex. We found that the time it took for participants to stop a continuous movement was impaired (i.e., longer) in PD patients ON medication compared with both patients OFF medication and HC. This finding was accompanied by diminished midfrontal theta power following the stop signal in PD (ON and OFF) compared with HC. Additionally, an increase in midfrontal beta power was observed, which was higher in unplanned stopping compared with planned for all groups. However, this increase in beta occurred late&mdash;after the time of outright stopping. Together, these findings demonstrate that stopping ongoing movements was impaired in PD patients ON medication and theta and beta power play distinct roles in inhibition of movement.</p>

                <p>by Michal Zurkowski, Maja Marusic, Dorota Gudanis-Sobocinska, Marta Szachniuk</p>

The structural diversity of nucleic acids extends far beyond the canonical Watson–Crick base pairing, encompassing higher-order motifs, such as triads, tetrads, pentads, hexads, heptads, and octads, which play critical roles in genome regulation and stability. Among these, tetrads – forming the core of G-quadruplexes – and their polyadic extensions have emerged as key determinants in fundamental processes ranging from replication and transcription to telomere maintenance. However, the detection and characterization of these complex motifs in experimental structures remain challenging. To address this, we present LinkTetrado, a computational tool for the automated identification and classification of polyadic motifs in nucleic acid 3D structures. Applied to a curated dataset of 529 nucleic acid structures, LinkTetrado identified 25 unique structures containing such motifs, including previously unreported pentads, hexads, heptads, and octads in both DNA and RNA. Manual validation using NMR restraints and chemical shift data confirmed the accuracy of motif assignments and underscored the importance of integrating experimental evidence for reliable detection. LinkTetrado achieves a precision of 0.87 in identifying polyads. The tool is freely available at https://github.com/michal-zurkowski/linktetrado and provides a foundation for the systematic exploration of higher-order nucleic acid motifs.

Cancer metastasis, which requires migration of cancer cells away from the primary tumor, is responsible for approximately 65% percent of cancer-related deaths. Therefore, targeting signaling pathways that drive cancer cell migration or proliferation is a common therapeutic approach. Cell migration is commonly studied using experimental approaches which track cells or cell monolayers as they evolve over time. Computational modeling can then be used to fit partial differential equation (PDE) models to the data, providing mechanistic insights underlying the observed cell motion, including the contribution of various cellular behaviors such as random motion, directed motion, and cell division. A popular experimental technique, the scratch assay, measures the migration and proliferation-driven cell closure of a scratch in a confluent cell monolayer. However, these assays do not disambiguate between different drivers of scratch closure (for instance between cell proliferation and migration to open space). To improve analysis of this technique, we combine scratch assays, video microscopy, and PDE inference to gain quantitative insight to mechanisms of cell migration and proliferation. We capture the evolution of cell density fields over time using live-cell microscopy and automated image processing. Our PDE inference methods involve the use of weak form-based system identification techniques for cell density dynamics modeled with advection-diffusion-reaction systems. We then compare our method with recent modeling work, finding that our model discovery tool automatically identifies similar models including reaction and diffusion terms from a larger set of bases. We demonstrate the application of this framework on 2-dimensional scratch assays subject to the inhibiting effect of trametinib on wound closure and characterize the results in the context of the quantified uncertainty in our inference approach. Our integrated experimental and computational pipeline can be used to rapidly identify and refine models of cell migration in a variety of contexts, enabling the quantitative measurement of the effect of drugs and other perturbations on cell migration and proliferation with uncertainty accounted for.

                <p>by Dovi Yellin, Noam Siegel, Rafael Malach, Oren Shriki</p>

Ultra-slow fluctuations are a hallmark of spontaneous cortical activity. We examine the hypothesis that these dynamics arise from recurrent neuronal networks operating near a phase-transition point, a state marked by “critical slowing down”. In such networks, a subtle shift toward criticality should selectively amplify slow fluctuations, providing a lever that can switch the cortex from quiet rest into self-generated behavior. Using a simple random recurrent network, we reproduce this amplification effect. The resulting spectra closely match intracranial electroencephalography from human visual cortex recorded during rest and during category-specific visual free recall. In particular, the model captures the experimentally observed enhancement of slow fluctuations during recall. These simulations reveal a parsimonious mechanism that explains spontaneous ultra-slow activity and enables rapid transitions between spontaneous states, suggesting that dynamic tuning toward criticality may be a general strategy by which cortical networks enter a generative mode.

Sleep onset is characterized by a departure from arousal, and can be separated into well-differentiated stages: NREM (which encompasses three substages: N1, N2 and N3) and REM (Rapid Eye Movement). Awake brain dynamics are maintained by various wake-promoting mechanisms, particularly the neuromodulators Acetylcholine (ACh) and Noradrenaline (NA), whose levels naturally decrease during the transition to sleep. The combined influence of these neurotransmitters on brain connectivity during sleep remains unclear, as previous models have examined them mostly in isolation or only in deep sleep. In this study, we analyze fMRI data obtained from healthy individuals and employ a Whole Brain model to investigate how changes in brain neurochemistry during NREM sleep, specifically involving ACh and NA, affect the Functional Connectivity (FC) of the brain. FC analysis reveals distinct connectivity changes: a decrease in Locus Coeruleus (LC) connectivity with the cortex during N2 and N3, and a decrease in Basal Forebrain (BF) connectivity with the cortex during N3. Additionally, compared to Wakefulness (W), there is a transition to a more integrated state in N1 and a more segregated state in N3. Using a Wilson-Cowan whole brain model, informed by an empirical connectome and a heterogeneous receptivity map of neuromodulators, we explored possible mechanisms underlying these dynamics. We fit the model adjusting the coupling and input-output slope of the Whole Brain model to account for ACh and NA, respectively, and show that region-specific neurotransmitter effect is key to explain their effects on FC. This work enhances our understanding of neurotransmitters’ roles in modulating sleep stages and their significant contribution to brain state transitions between different states of consciousness, both in health and disease.

                <p>by Jordan T. Becker, Clayton K. Mickelson, Lauren M. Pross, Autumn E. Sanders, Esther R. Vogt, Frances K. Shepherd, Chloe Wick, Alison J. Barkhymer, Stephanie L. Aron, Elizabeth J. Fay, Reuben S. Harris, Ryan A. Langlois</p>

Zoonotic viruses are an omnipresent threat to global health. Influenza A virus (IAV) transmits between birds, livestock, and humans. Proviral host factors involved in the cross-species interface are well known. Less is known about antiviral mechanisms that suppress IAV zoonoses. We observed CpG dinucleotide depletion in human IAV relative to avian IAV. Notably, human ZAP selectively depletes CpG-enriched viral RNAs with its cofactor KHNYN. ZAP is conserved in tetrapods, but we uncovered that avian species lack KHNYN. We found that chicken ZAP may not affect IAV (PR8) or CpG-enriched IAV (PR8CG). Human ZAP or KHNYN independently restricted CpG-enriched IAV PR8CG by overexpression in chicken cells and by combined knockout in human cells. Additionally, mammalian ZAP-L and KHNYN also independently restricted an avian retrovirus (ROSV). Curiously, platypus KHNYN, the most divergent from eutherian mammals, was also capable of independent restriction of multiple diverse viruses. We suggest that some mammalian KHNYN can act as a <i>bona fide</i> restriction factor with cell-autonomous activity. Furthermore, we speculate that through repeated contact between avian viruses and mammalian hosts, protein changes may accompany CpG-biased mutations or reassortment to evade mammalian ZAP and KHNYN.

                <p>by Marc-Andre Schulz, Nys Tjade Siegel, Kerstin Ritter</p>

This study critically reevaluates the utility of brain-age models within the context of detecting neurological and psychiatric disorders, challenging the conventional emphasis on maximizing chronological age prediction accuracy. Our analysis of T1 MRI data from 46,381 UK Biobank participants reveals that simpler machine learning models, and notably those with excessive regularization, demonstrate superior sensitivity to disease-relevant changes compared to their more complex counterparts, despite being less accurate in chronological age prediction. This counterintuitive discovery suggests that models traditionally deemed inferior might, in fact, offer a more meaningful biomarker for brain health by capturing variations pertinent to disease states. These findings challenge the assumption that accuracy-optimized brain-age models serve as useful normative models of brain aging. Optimizing for age accuracy appears misaligned with normative aims: it drives models to rely on low-variance aging features and to deemphasize higher-variance signals that are more informative about brain health and disease. Consequently, we propose a recalibration of focus towards models that, while less accurate in conventional terms, yield brain-age gaps with larger patient-control effect sizes, offering greater utility in early disease detection and understanding the multifaceted nature of brain aging.

                <p>by Srinivas Abhishek Mutnuru, Pooja Yadav, Parik Kakani, Shruti Ganesh Dhamdhere, Poorva Kumari, Shruti Agrawal, Atul Samaiya, Sanjeev Shukla</p>

Tumor hypoxia induced alterations in the epigenetic landscape and alternative splicing influence cellular adaptations. PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that regulates several tumorigenic events in many cancer types. However, the regulation of PRMT5 and its direct implication on aberrant alternative splicing under hypoxia remains unexplored. In this study, we observed hypoxia-induced upregulation of PRMT5 via the CTCF in human breast cancer cells. Further, PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s directly regulated the alternative splicing of <i>TCF3</i>. Under hypoxia, PRMT5-mediated histone dimethylation at the intronic conserved region (ICR) present between <i>TCF3</i> exon 18a and exon 18b recruits DNMT3A, resulting in DNA methylation. DNA methylation at the <i>TCF3</i>-ICR is recognized and bound by MeCP2 resulting in RNA-Pol II pausing, promoting the recruitment of the negative splicing factor PTBP1 to the splicing locus of <i>TCF3</i> pre-mRNA. PTBP1 promotes the exclusion of exon 18a which results in the production of the pro-invasive TCF3-18B (E47) isoform which promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells under hypoxia. Collectively, our results indicate PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation of histones regulates alternative splicing of <i>TCF3</i> gene thereby enhancing EMT and invasion in breast cancer hypoxia.

                Introduction Radiation plexopathy is known to depend on various parameters, and is rarely reported in head&neck cancers. While literature suggests dose constraints of 60-66 Gy, our study aimed to evaluate late brachial plexopathy after primary chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with IMRT, and determine the maximum tolerated dose. Methods Between May 2015 and March 2020, a retrospective cohort of 50 patients with a history of previously irradiated nasopharyngeal cancer was identified. All patients underwent definitive treatment using IMRT at recommended curative doses. Clinical and treatment-related characteristics were collected, and all cases were reviewed for symptoms of radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to their inclusion in the study. Results Of the 50 patients, 98% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The mean age at treatment was 44 years. All patients received a maximum dose of ≥ 60 Gy. The maximum dose to the BP (BPmax) was 82.64 Gy (mean: 72.8 Gy). The mean dose received by 0.03 cm3 of the BP was 71.74 Gy. Among patients with nodal involvement, 86% received a maximum dose of ≥ 66 Gy. A correlation study with N-category showed a significant increase in BPmax dose with increasing nodal stage. The mean BPmax for patients with level III/IV lymph nodes (75.19 Gy) was higher than for those with level I/II involvement (69.19 Gy) (P = 0.0001). All patients had a minimum follow-up of two years, with a mean follow-up duration of 37.5 months. Five patients reported clinical symptoms of acute or late brachial plexopathy, but none had confirmation via MRI or electromyography. Conclusion In our study using IMRT for nasopharyngeal cancer patients and with a minimum follow-up of two years, it appears safe to deliver > 66 Gy to the brachial plexus. However, longer follow-up is required.

                Background Philonis inermis is a Neotropical stem-galling weevil specialized on the invasive vine Passiflora foetida and represents a promising candidate for biological control. However, no genomic or barcoding data have previously been available for this genus, limiting its taxonomic resolution and risk assessment potential. Methods We used shallow whole-genome sequencing of two individuals reared under controlled conditions to assemble the complete mitochondrial genome of P. inermis. The mitogenome was annotated and compared with other Cryptorhynchinae species. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences from 20 Colombian individuals were analyzed alongside 24 American Cryptorhynchinae barcodes retrieved from GenBank to evaluate intra- and interspecific genetic divergence. Results The P. inermis mitogenome is 15,120 bp in length, AT-rich (77.0%), and contains 36 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes, 21 tRNAs, and two rRNAs. The tRNA-Ile was not detected, likely obscured within the variable control region, as reported for other cryptorhynchines. Phylogenetic analysis based on mitogenomic sequences placed P. inermis as a well-supported clade closely related to Eucryptorrhynchus. COI barcode analysis revealed extremely low intraspecific divergence (pairwise K2P ≤ 0.006) and a pronounced barcode gap distinguishing P. inermis from other Cryptorhynchinae species. In addition, 196 single-copy orthologs were identified from the shallow assemblies, providing a basis for future phylogenomic investigations. Conclusion This study presents the first complete mitochondrial genome for the genus Philonis and confirms the reliability of COI barcoding for its accurate identification. These genomic resources lay the foundation for integrative taxonomic, comparative, and evolutionary studies, and support the evaluation of P. inermis as a potential biological control agent against P. foetida.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of heart failure and the most common indication for cardiac transplantation in young adults. The clinical spectrum of DCM is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to advanced heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Methods Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on germline DNA of the index case followed by segregation analysis of the identified variants on family ‘members by Sanger sequencing. Results We identified in the proband, a boy aged of 2-years, heterozygous germline nonsense variant in the TTN gene (c.95008C>T, p.Arg31670*), combined with other nonsense variant in the CTNNA3 gene (c.2023G>T, p.Glu675*). Segregation analysis revealed that both variants co-segregate with the disease phenotype within the family. This is the first report of the co-occurrence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic nonsense variants in TTN and CTNNA3 genes in DCM patients. Conclusions Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of DCM in North African populations and underscore the importance of genetic screening in familial cardiomyopathies.

                Background Cutaneous metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are rare, occurring in fewer than 5% of metastatic cases, and typically indicate advanced disease with poor prognosis. Case presentation We report the case of a 42-year-old man previously treated with curative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. Eighteen months after completion of therapy, he presented with pruritic eczematous skin lesions in the right inguinal fold, gluteal region, and perianal area. Biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin (CK20-positive/CK7-negative). Restaging CT scan demonstrated new non-necrotic lymphadenopathy at the aortic bifurcation and bilateral internal iliac chains, without visceral metastases. The disease was classified as unresectable metastatic recurrence (stage IV). The patient was referred for palliative systemic therapy, with molecular profiling (RAS/BRAF/MSI) to guide treatment. Conclusions Cutaneous metastases are an uncommon manifestation of CRC recurrence and may mimic benign dermatologic conditions. Prompt biopsy of atypical skin lesions in CRC survivors is crucial for early detection. Systemic therapy remains the cornerstone of management, guided by molecular features. Emerging immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic combinations offer potential benefit even in microsatellite-stable disease.

                Abstract Background In response to the global cumulative reported case fatality ratio of COVID-19 following the detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, governments and healthcare authorities worldwide have developed and distributed an impressive number of new COVID-19 vaccines. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vaccination status and the outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to explore the association between vaccination status and the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods A retrospective study was carried in Aseer Central Hospital, Abha City, Saudi Arabia. The study included all hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 606) admitted to the intensive care unit of Aseer Central Hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who had their detailed personal characteristics, vaccination status, and confirmed outcome (i.e., survival or death) recorded. Results On admission, 62.5% of the patients did not receive any vaccine doses against COVID-19, while 8.1% received one dose, 14.5% received two doses, and 14.9% received three doses. The condition of 51.3% of the patients was critical. Case fatality rates of included patients differed significantly according to their blood groups, received vaccine doses, gender, age groups, nationality, and among those who received intubation or BiPAP/CPAP masks (p<0.001 for all). There were significant odds ratios for patients’ vaccination status, health status on admission, and nationality (p<0.001 for all). Conclusions Vaccination against COVID-19 has a significant preventive impact on patients’ case fatality. Risk factors related to higher case fatalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients including older age, non-Saudi, and being critically ill, should be considered in any future outbreaks or epidemics.

                Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, Payr et al. reveal how multiple RNA-binding proteins synergize to repress translation. One RNA-binding protein binds via facilitated diffusion, recruits other proteins with highly accelerated on rate, and gets stabilized by several co-factors. The findings highlight various mRNP assembly mechanism as key to efficient translational control.

                Shawky et al. show that DDX3X selectively promotes or represses mRNA translation in a stress-dependent manner. This bidirectional regulation involves position-specific binding to the mRNA 5′ UTR and early coding region, reflecting distinct mechanisms, including initiation control during 48S scanning and translational repression associated with ac4C post-transcriptional modification.

                Lamb et al. show that the circadian clock rhythmically remodels ribosome composition in Neurospora crassa. Clock-regulated incorporation of the ribosomal protein eL31 is required for rhythmic translation and translation fidelity, linking temporal ribosome remodeling to daily changes in proteome diversity.

                Xu et al. show that ROS induced by heavy metals in Solanum nigrum and rice triggers IAA synthesis in two rhizosphere plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPBs). IAA effectively suppresses ROS generation in plants, thereby alleviating heavy metal stress. Microbial IAA further induces DNA methylation modifications in roots through ROS-dependent or -independent pathways.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 28 October 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64530-8">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-64530-8</a></p>The authors experimentally demonstrate the refraction and reflection of flexural waves at a temporal boundary in an elastic beam with time-varying stiffness, achieved through piezoelectric patches and circuit-driven modulation. The findings validate the temporal Snell’s law and Fresnel equations, enabling precise control over wave amplitude and frequency.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 28 October 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64566-w">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-64566-w</a></p>Children born to women living with HIV suffer increased morbidity and, in low-income settings, have two to three times the mortality of infants born to women without HIV. Here, we profile the milk metabolome of 326 women living with and without HIV sampled longitudinally for 18 months postpartum using global metabolomics. Our findings demonstrate that milk tryptophan content and availability decrease among WLWH, which may indicate perturbations in milk tryptophan catabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101175">Cell membrane glycan contents are biochemical factors that constitute a kinetic barrier to viral particle uptake in a protein-nonspecific manner</a></h4>

              
                Various types of glycoproteins have been suggested to inhibit viral infection of cells via steric repulsion. However, it is difficult to evaluate such physical actions genetically, simply because they are nonspecific and can be caused by any molecule. Therefore, we investigated a method to compare this nonspecific action among cells with diverse membrane protein profiles. We found that a wide range of glycoproteins individually had a strong inhibitory effect on infection, while on the other hand, the total amount of glycans was negatively correlated with the infection level in each cell. Thus, the infection-inhibitory effect of glycoproteins was molecularly nonspecific but was additively enhanced according to the amount of glycans on the cell surface. In this correlation, glycans function as a fundamental factor. Further investigating the mechanism by which glycans function as a factor in infection control, we conclude that the repulsion between proteins created by branched glycans forms a kinetic energy barrier against packing the virus into the region of protein interstitial space. As a result, the formation of the adhesive interface between the virus and the cell membrane, which is necessary for infection, is inhibited. This study attempted to link the cell’s nonspecific physical properties with intracellular biochemicals. A similar approach may be applied to quantify other nonspecific biological phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96423">Changes in neural progenitor lineage composition during astrocytic differentiation of human iPSCs</a></h4>

              
                The regional specificity of stem cell-derived astrocytes is believed to be an important prerequisite for their application in disease modelling and cell-based therapies. Due to the lack of subtype-defining markers for astrocytes in different regions of the brain, the regional identity of in vitro-derived astrocytes is often declared by the dominant positional characteristics of their antecedent neural progenitors, patterned to a fate of interest, with the assumption that the positional trait is preserved by the derived astrocytes via linear descent. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell line designed for tracing derivatives of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> cells combined with a ventral midbrain induction paradigm, we show that astrocytes originating from LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors can only be generated if these progenitors are purified prior to the astrocyte differentiation process, or their progenies are gradually lost to progenies of LMX1A<sup>-</sup> progenitors. This finding indicates that the lineage composition of iPSC-derived astrocytes may not accurately recapitulate the founder progenitor population. Using deep single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic signatures in astrocytes derived from the LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells. Our study highlights the need for rigorous characterization of pluripotent stem cell-derived regional astrocytes and provides a resource for assessing LMX1A<sup>+</sup> ventral midbrain progenitor-derived human astrocytes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105753">Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects in healthy individuals</a></h4>

              
                Placebo and nocebo effects illustrate the profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions. Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored. Using a within-subject design in 104 healthy individuals, we investigated and directly compared the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a 1-week follow-up. The study was preregistered in the German Clinical Trials Register (registration number: DRKS00029228). Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on days 1 and 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after 1 week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106187">Critique of impure reason: Unveiling the reasoning behaviour of medical large language models</a></h4>

              
                Despite the current ubiquity of large language models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their <i>reasoning behaviour</i>. We emphasise the importance of understanding <i>reasoning behaviour</i> as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of <i>reasoning behaviour</i> and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modelling and evaluating <i>reasoning</i> in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of <i>large reasoning models</i>. The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102663">The Rab7-Epg5 and Rab39-ema modules cooperatively position autophagosomes for efficient lysosomal fusions</a></h4>

              
                Macroautophagy, a major self-degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells, utilizes autophagosomes to transport self-material to lysosomes for degradation. While microtubular transport is crucial for the proper function of autophagy, the exact roles of factors responsible for positioning autophagosomes remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen targeting genes potentially involved in microtubular motility. A genetic background that blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusions was used to accurately analyze autophagosome positioning. We discovered that pre-fusion autophagosomes move towards the non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) in <i>Drosophila</i> fat cells, which requires a dynein-dynactin complex. This process is regulated by the small GTPases Rab7 and Rab39 together with their adaptors: Epg5 and ema, respectively. The dynein-dependent movement of vesicles toward the nucleus/ncMTOC is essential for efficient autophagosomal fusions with lysosomes and subsequent degradation. Remarkably, altering the balance of kinesin and dynein motors changes the direction of autophagosome movement, indicating a competitive relationship where normally dynein-mediated transport prevails. Since pre-fusion lysosomes were positioned similarly to autophagosomes, it indicates that pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes converge at the ncMTOC, which increases the efficiency of vesicle fusions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103592">Gene regulatory dynamics during craniofacial development in a carnivorous marsupial</a></h4>

              
                Marsupials and placental mammals exhibit significant differences in reproductive and life history strategies. Marsupials are born highly underdeveloped after an extremely short period of gestation, leading to prioritized development of structures critical for post-birth survival in the pouch. Critically, they must undergo accelerated development of the orofacial region compared to placentals. Previously, we described the accelerated development of the orofacial region in the carnivorous Australian marsupial, the fat-tailed dunnart <i>Sminthopsis crassicaudata</i>, that has one of the shortest gestations of any mammal. By combining genome comparisons of the mouse and dunnart with functional data for the enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, we investigated divergence of craniofacial regulatory landscapes between these species. This is the first description of genome-wide face regulatory elements in a marsupial, with 60,626 putative enhancers and 12,295 putative promoters described. We also generated craniofacial RNA-seq data for the dunnart to investigate expression dynamics of genes near predicted active regulatory elements. While genes involved in regulating facial development were largely conserved in mouse and dunnart, the regulatory landscape varied significantly. Additionally, a subset of dunnart-specific enhancers was associated with genes highly expressed only in dunnart relating to cranial neural crest proliferation, embryonic myogenesis, and epidermis development. Comparative RNA-seq analyses of facial tissue revealed dunnart-specific expression of genes involved in the development of the mechanosensory system. Accelerated development of the dunnart sensory system likely relates to the sensory cues received by the nasal–oral region during the postnatal journey to the pouch. Together, these data suggest that accelerated face development in the dunnart may be driven by dunnart-specific enhancer activity. Our study highlights the power of marsupial–placental comparative genomics for understanding the role of enhancers in driving temporal shifts in development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106873">Newly trained navigation and verbal memory skills in humans elicit changes in task-related networks but not brain structure</a></h4>

              
                Training cognitive skills, such as remembering a list of words or navigating a new city, has important implications for everyday life. Yet, understanding what brain changes in humans underlies the acquisition of complex cognitive skills remains unresolved. Here, we developed and validated intensive multiweek interventions in which participants were randomly assigned training in either navigation or verbal memory. Healthy young participants (N=75) underwent structural and functional imaging prior to and following the training. Based on pre-registered and exploratory analyses, we did not find any evidence for changes to gross hippocampal or hippocampal subfield volume, cortical brain volume, or microstructural properties of major white matter tracts due to the training. In contrast, network-based analyses suggested changes in task-related informational connectivity, which occurred primarily between cortical areas and mostly involved putative cognitive control networks. These results suggest that cognitive interventions target more transient configurations in network connectivity rather than more durable structural changes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91411">Measuring changes in Plasmodium falciparum census population size in response to sequential malaria control interventions</a></h4>

              
                Here, we introduce a new endpoint ‘census population size’ to evaluate the epidemiology and control of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> infections, where the parasite, rather than the infected human host, is the unit of measurement. To calculate census population size, we rely on a definition of parasite variation known as multiplicity of infection (MOI<i><sub>var</sub></i>), based on the hyper-diversity of the <i>var</i> multigene family. We present a Bayesian approach to estimate MOI<i><sub>var</sub></i> from sequencing and counting the number of unique DBLα tags (or DBLα types) of <i>var</i> genes, and derive from it census population size by summation of MOI<i><sub>var</sub></i> in the human population. We track changes in this parasite population size and structure through sequential malaria interventions by indoor residual spraying (IRS) and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) from 2012 to 2017 in an area of high, seasonal malaria transmission in northern Ghana. Following IRS, which reduced transmission intensity by &gt;90% and decreased parasite prevalence by ~40–50%, significant reductions in <i>var</i> diversity, MOI<i><sub>var</sub></i>, and population size were observed in ~2000 humans across all ages. These changes, consistent with the loss of diverse parasite genomes, were short-lived and 32 months after IRS was discontinued and SMC was introduced, <i>var</i> diversity and population size rebounded in all age groups except for the younger children (1–5 years) targeted by SMC. Despite major perturbations from IRS and SMC interventions, the parasite population remained very large and retained the <i>var</i> population genetic characteristics of a high-transmission system (high <i>var</i> diversity; low <i>var</i> repertoire similarity), demonstrating the resilience of <i>P. falciparum</i> to short-term interventions in high-burden countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99502">Neuronal migration depends on blood flow in the adult mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                In animal tissues, several cell types migrate along blood vessels, raising the possibility that blood flow influences cell migration. Here, we show that blood flow promotes the migration of new olfactory-bulb neurons in the adult mammalian brain. Neuronal migration is facilitated by blood flow, leading to accumulation of new neurons near blood vessels with abundant blood flow. Blood flow inhibition attenuates blood vessel-guided neuronal migration, suggesting that blood contains factors beneficial to neuronal migration. We found that ghrelin, which is increased in blood by hunger, directly influences neuronal migration. Ghrelin signaling promotes somal translocation by activating actin cytoskeleton contraction at the rear of the cell soma. New neurons mature in the olfactory bulb and contribute to the olfactory function for sensing odorants from food. Finally, we show that neuronal migration is increased by calorie restriction, and that ghrelin signaling is involved in the process. This study suggests that blood flow promotes neuronal migration through blood-derived ghrelin signaling in the adult brain, which could be one of the mechanisms that improves the olfactory function for food-seeking behavior during starvation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102144">Deep3DSIM: Super-resolution imaging of thick tissue using 3D structured illumination with adaptive optics</a></h4>

              
                Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) doubles the resolution of fluorescence imaging in all directions and enables optical sectioning with increased image contrast. However, 3D-SIM has not been widely applied to imaging deep in thick tissues due to its sensitivity to sample-induced aberrations, making the method difficult to apply beyond 10 µm in depth. Furthermore, 3D-SIM has not been available in an upright configuration, limiting its use for live imaging while manipulating the specimen, for example, with electrophysiology. Here, we have overcome these barriers by developing a novel upright 3D-SIM system (termed Deep3DSIM) that incorporates adaptive optics for aberration correction and remote focusing, reducing artefacts, improving contrast, restoring resolution, and eliminating the need to move the specimen or the objective lens in volume imaging. These advantages are equally applicable to inverted 3D-SIM systems. We demonstrate high-quality 3D-SIM imaging in various samples, including imaging more than 130 µm into the <i>Drosophila</i> brain.

">Integrated analysis implicates novel insights of NMB into lactate metabolism and immune response prediction in primary glioblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Background: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, exhibits profound treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Despite advances in immunotherapy for other cancers, GBM remains refractory, potentially due to its lactate-rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While aerobic glycolysis-driven lactate accumulation is known to acidify the TME and impair immune function, the precise mechanisms linking lactate metabolism to immune evasion in GBM remain elusive. Methods: We integrated multi-omics analyses with machine learning to identify - gene signatures associated lactate metabolism (LM) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Multiple bioinformatic tools were employed to determine the association of key genes with TME remodeling, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivities. Results: Neuromedin B (NMB) emerged as a pivotal regulator of lactate-mediated immunosuppression, correlating strongly with LM and TIDE. We found that NMB expression was remarkably correlated with clinical characteristics, immune response, TME remodeling and drug sensitivities. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that NMB is a key cross-factor in metabolic and immune regulation in GBM. It breaks through the traditional perception that metabolism and immunity are mutually exclusive in cancer by promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and enhancing anti-tumor immunity through its dual functions. It provides a new direction for the combined intervention of metabolic targeting and immunotherapy, and the strong predictive value of NMB expression for drug response further highlights its clinical application potential in the formulation of personalized treatment strategies for GBM patients.

">Visualization and Morphological Analysis of Individual Oligodendrocytes in the Mouse White Matter</a></h4>

              
                Myelin formation by oligodendrocytes is essential for the regulation of the conduction velocity and proper brain function. To ensure accurate information processing in response to experiences such as sensory stimuli and learning, oligodendrocytes adjust their number and morphology. In addition, oligodendrocyte morphology changes with senescence and in the presence of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, visualizing oligodendrocytes and analyzing their morphology is crucial for understanding how our brains change under such conditions. Herein, we describe the methods for labeling and analyzing the morphologies of individual oligodendrocytes in mouse white matter at the light microscopic level. PDGFRa-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP and PLP-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP mice enable us to visualize and analyze later-born or early-born oligodendrocyte morphology. In addition, sparse oligodendrocyte labeling with attenuated rabies virus expressing GFP enables the visualization and morphological analysis of individual oligodendrocytes in various brain white matter regions without the need for transgenic animals. Furthermore, the combination with immunostaining in thick tissues enables the identification of labeled oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths, as well as their interactions with neuronal axons. These methods are suitable for revealing how oligodendrocytes adapt their morphologies depending on environmental stimuli or pathological conditions.

">Keratinocyte Pannexin-1 is essential for Mechanical Hypersensitivity following Traumatic Peripheral Nerve Injury</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain remains one of the most prevalent and challenging forms of chronic pain to manage. It is characterized by severe cutaneous touch and cold evoked pain. Whereas the contribution of peripheral nerves to neuropathic pain is well established, the influence of peripheral non-neuronal cells that interact with injured nerves has not been studied in depth. Keratinocytes, the primary cell type in the epidermis, play an important role in the initial processing of environmental mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal conditions. Here, we investigated the role of keratinocytes following traumatic peripheral nerve injury and determined that these cells contribute to injury-associated heightened sensation. We performed tibial spared nerve injury (tSNI) in mice that selectively express archaerhodopsin in keratinocytes to temporally reduce activity from these cells at various timepoints following injury. Brief (5 min) optogenetic inhibition completely reversed both the mechanical and cold hypersensitivity at acute (4 days) and throughout chronic (17 weeks) timepoints following tSNI. Keratinocytes isolated from the spared glabrous skin dermatome were sensitized to mechanical and cold stimuli and found to release factors that enhance activity of sensory neurons. Moreover, we found that keratinocyte phospholipase A2 (PLA2) driven activation of pannexin-1 is critical for the long term development of mechanical allodynia. This discovery indicates that keratinocytes contribute substantially to the mechanical and cold allodynia after traumatic nerve injury and suggest that keratinocytes may be a topical therapeutic target to alleviate the severe touch- and cold-evoked cutaneous pain following peripheral nerve injury.

">Ventral tegmental area dopamine controls timing variability</a></h4>

              
                Precision defines successful behavior, yet the brain mechanisms promoting precision are unclear. Here, we dissect dopaminergic circuits controlling precision along a single behavioral dimension - the timing of action. We use an interval timing paradigm that requires participants to indicate their estimate of an interval of several seconds with a motor response. We find that humans with Parkinson's disease (PD) had increased timing variability that predicted PD-related cognitive deficits and executive dysfunction. Surprisingly, lesioning ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons increased temporal variability. Further, GCaMP6s fiber photometry demonstrated that VTA dopamine neuron activity is strongly modulated at the start of temporal intervals, and that this trial start related activity predicted temporal variability. Finally, we found that stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons improved timing by decreasing temporal variability in both intact and dopamine depleted animals. Our data establish a model of cognitive symptoms of human PD and provide insight into the neuronal control of temporal variability, which impacts a wide range of executive functions.

">Longitudinal, simultaneous wide-field fluorescent Ca2+ imaging and fMRI in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied in mice and humans making it a key technology in translational neuroimaging research. Yet, most neuroimaging studies in rodents use anesthesia to limit subject motion and stress. This puts a hard boundary on the range of brain and behavioral states that can be studied in animals, and deviates from the near-universal practice of imaging people whilst awake. Recent years have seen a push towards the development of acclimation protocols for imaging mice without anesthesia, but the results have been mixed. In parallel, imaging mice without anesthesia has become routine for complementary neuroimaging methods, including wide-field fluorescence calcium (WF-Ca2+) imaging. We present the first longitudinal protocol for simultaneous WF-Ca2+ and fMRI in awake mice. Our approach is comprised of a two-phase (biphasic) acclimation protocol that results in high-quality multimodal data, enabling direct comparison of neuronal mesoscopic and hemodynamic signals across brain states and time. Data from awake mice are compared with data from isoflurane-anesthetized imaging sessions to unlock state-dependent differences in functional connectivity, which show both convergent and divergent patterns between imaging modalities. Together, these results establish a framework for longitudinal awake multimodal imaging and uncover new insights into the neural and vascular functional organization of the mouse brain across states and time.

">Impaired Peri-infarct Long-Term Potentiation Suggests Alternative Mechanisms of Post-stroke Recovery in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early after stroke, a period of heightened plasticity in the peri-infarct cortex is thought to provide the physiological substrate for functional motor recovery through increased expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Prior slice electrophysiology studies on the capacity for LTP after stroke reported conflicting results. Slice preparation could have influenced the results by disrupting neuromodulatory processes altered after stroke. Therefore, whether LTP can be induced in the peri-infarct cortex remains to be elucidated. We investigated LTP in the peri-infarct cortex of anesthetized rats using a novel in vivo method that preserves local and long-range circuit dynamics. Methods: LTP, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were assessed under urethane anaesthesia in 15 rats (11 with focal stroke to the primary motor cortex, and 4 sham operated controls). Rats were tested one or two weeks after stroke using a minimally perturbed in vivo LTP induction protocol validated in naive rats. Motor function was evaluated using the cylinder test at baseline and at one or two-weeks post stroke. Results: LTP in the peri-infarct cortex was supressed in the stroke group compared to sham controls. In addition, synaptic transmission was reduced for higher stimulation intensities, and short-term plasticity shifted from facilitation to depression, indicating impaired synaptic function at one- and two-weeks post-stroke. Behaviorally, the lesioned rats exhibited motor deficits at one week but showed full recovery by two weeks post-stroke. Conclusion: In recovering animals, both LTP and synaptic transmission are profoundly impaired in the peri-infarct cortex. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than LTP- based plasticity underlie motor recovery during this stage.

">Explicit memory representations in decisions from experience</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement learning (RL) models explain how people adapt behavior through incremental value updates, but assume that individual experiences are not explicitly stored or retrieved. Across two experiments (N=282 and N= 1,818), we tested whether people rely on such explicit memory representations during experience-based choice. Participants sampled outcomes from two lotteries and, in an "ignore" condition, were instructed to disregard specific outcomes before deciding. Ignoring these outcomes substantially altered preferences, suggesting that choices were guided by explicit episodic representations rather than cumulative reinforcement. Frequency judgments revealed generally accurate memory for experienced outcomes, but reduced precision for continuous compared with discrete outcome distributions. These findings challenge purely incremental RL accounts and support theories proposing that human choice integrates flexible episodic memory with reinforcement mechanisms, bridging models of learning, memory, and decision-making.

">Sex-divergent brain epigenetic reprogramming by chronic opioids</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic condition that exhibits sex differences in prevalence, symptoms and treatment. Yet, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region in OUD, to define the multiomic consequences of chronic morphine exposure in male and female mice. We profiled DNA methylation, five histone post-translational modifications, and their transcriptional effects at bulk and cell-type-specific levels. Despite comparable tissue organization and neurophysiological responses to morphine, epigenetic adaptations occurred at highly sex-specific genomic loci. These adaptations nevertheless followed common mechanistic principles, acting at similar gene features and transcription factor binding sites across sexes. Strikingly, they converged on overlapping genes, biological functions, and co-expression modules, and partially recapitulated transcriptional signatures of OUD in men and women. Therefore, our findings uncover a profound epigenetic sex divergence that mediates convergent biological dysregulation, and highlight opportunities for developing improved therapeutic strategies tailored to sex-specific mechanisms.

">Preserved perception-action dissociation but altered visuomotor behaviours in healthy aging.</a></h4>

              
                The two visual pathways hypothesis posits distinct brain systems for vision-for-perception and vision-for-action. While this dissociation is well-established in younger adults, its integrity in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this, younger (n = 25, range: 18-25 years) and older adults (n = 25, range: 65-95 years) completed estimation and grasping tasks in two experiments. In Experiment 1, two rectangular objects with varying lengths (40 mm and 42 mm) were placed on the "far" and "close" surfaces of a Ponzo illusion. Despite age-related changes in grasping kinematics, the perception-action dissociation persisted. The Ponzo illusion influenced estimation such that objects placed on the "far" surface were perceived as longer. In contrast, grasping was not affected by the illusion, and even showed effect in the opposite direction, with larger apertures for objects placed on the "close" surface of the illusion. Experiment 2 tested whether this reversed effect was mediated by the surface size on which the object was placed, rather than perceived distance. To this end, we removed the illusory distance cues and varied only the background surface size ("big" versus "small"). While perceptual estimations were unaffected, surface size modulated grasping in both age groups, with a stronger effect in older adults. These findings indicate that the perception-action dissociation is preserved in aging, but older adults rely more on contextual cues during action, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms to maintain visuomotor performance.

">Comparison of dimensionality reduction and feature selection for cognitive task decoding in functional magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                Background Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have led to the ability to study the brain across many contexts. However, the large number of features generated by functional connectivity approaches may overfit the data. These problems can be overcome with either feature selection (FS) or dimensionality reduction (DR), which can be applied to less complex models. We utilize two open-source datasets to compare the performance of DR/FS methods on cognitive task decoding using a suite of ML classifiers. New Method While DR and FS methods have been used previously in decoding research, no systematic comparison of their performance has been undertaken. Here, we compare available methods using commonly utilized machine learning libraries to establish which methods provide the best predictive performance. We then conduct statistical tests to examine the relative contributions of DR and FS methods and classifiers on decoding accuracy. Results Neither DR or FS was found to be superior. However, differences were identified across datasets and tasks. In the majority of methods and datasets, a peak in predictive performance was found using a small percentage of the total number of original features. Comparison with existing methods Some methods perform better than the baseline method of prediction with all available features or selecting features randomly. Decoding performance utilizing the HCP datasets with certain DR/FS methods exceeds that of deep learning approaches. Conclusions Simple machine learning models with DR/FS have competitive decoding performance. These results suggest a sweet spot for the tradeoff between the retention of features and predictive accuracy.

">Mapping long-term memory modulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Long-term memory (LTM), which is the ability to retain information over a long period of time, is governed by neural oscillations in various parts of the cerebral cortex. To investigate the relationship between oscillations and memory performance, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been used to modulate LTM. However, due to the variability in stimulation parameters and locations, no clear picture has arisen on where tACS needs to be applied to improve LTM. Methods: We collected behavioral data from 20 studies (58 effect sizes) and computationally modeled the corresponding brain electric fields based on each study's unique tACS parameters. As a result, we generated a map of performance-electric field index (PEI) values using linear and quadratic fits. Results: Theta-tACS showed no regions with a positive linear association with LTM. However, left lateral prefrontal and temporal areas exhibited negative associations, meaning that theta stimulation of that region led to decreased LTM performance. A quadratic analysis revealed an inverted-U relation in the right parietal cortex, suggesting improved memory at moderate, but not high, electric field strengths. Gamma-tACS showed positive linear associations in parieto-occipital cortex and negative ones in frontal regions. For gamma, we found no regions that expressed a quadratic relationship. Conclusion: These findings indicate that LTM-relevant tACS effects are frequency- and site-specific and potentially nonlinear with respect to intensity. Integrating meta-analytic effect sizes with individualized field estimates provides a brain-wide framework for identifying targets of memory modulation and for guiding future fundamental and translational research.

">Humanized APOE mouse brain volume increases over age irrespective of sex and APOE genotype: Implications for translational validity to the human</a></h4>

              
                Translational validity of mouse models of human aging and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk are essential for both fundamental mechanistic science and therapeutic development. Given that the strongest risk factors for LOAD are age, female sex, and APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriership, models must reflect these biological variables and disease phenotypes. The use of mouse models with humanized APOE (hAPOE) is a key strategy to advance translational validity. To initially address translational validity of the hAPOE mouse model, we conducted ex-vivo magnetic resonance imaging analysis of brain volumes in male and female mice across APOE genotypes ({varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}3, {varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4, {varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4) and ages corresponding to a human lifespan of approximately 30-70 years (6-25 months in mice). The primary outcomes indicated that total MRI brain volume increased with age (an average of 2.12mm3 per month), irrespective of sex or APOE genotype. Additionally, APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers had greater total brain volumes than non-carriers. No sex differences were observed in total brain volume. Voxelwise analyses revealed a pattern of localized morphometric changes independent of differences in total brain volume. Age-related volumetric increases were distributed across subcortical regions (e.g., thalami, hippocampi), while age-related decreases were evident across cortical regions, notably the bilateral parieto-temporal and frontal lobes. Additionally, sex differences were evident after controlling for total brain volume, with females showing greater cortex-dominant volumes while males showed a pattern of greater volumes in regions including cerebellar cortices, olfactory bulbs, and striata. No genotypic effects were observed in the voxelwise analysis after correcting for multiple comparisons, suggesting that APOE genotype does not drive localized volume differences independent of total brain volume. These findings indicate that, at the MRI level of analysis, this humanized APOE mouse model does not recapitulate the volumetric atrophy typically seen in human brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. The results suggest that humanized APOE alone is insufficient to induce the LOAD atrophy phenotype. This model may better serve as a platform for studying vulnerable aging rather than a primary model for progressive neurodegenerative atrophy.

">The Human Brain as a Dynamic Mixture of Expert Models in Video Understanding</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is the most efficient and versatile system for processing dynamic visual input. By comparing representations from deep video models to brain activity, we can gain insights into mechanistic solutions for effective video processing, important to better understand the brain and to build better models. Current works in model-brain alignment primarily focus on fMRI measurements, leaving open questions about fine-grained dynamic processing. Here, we introduce the first large-scale benchmarking of both static and temporally-integrating deep neural networks on brain alignment to dynamic electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of short natural videos. We analyze 100+ models across the axes of temporal integration, classification task, architecture and pretraining using our proposed Cross-Temporal Representational Similarity Analysis (CT-RSA), which matches the best time-unfolded model features to dynamically evolving brain responses, distilling 107 alignment scores. Our findings reveal novel insights on how continuous visual input is integrated in the brain, beyond the standard temporal processing hierarchy from low to high-level representations. Responses in posterior electrodes, after initial alignment to hierarchical static object processing, best align to mid-level representations of temporally-integrative actions and closely match the unfolding video content. In contrast, responses in frontal electrodes best align with high-level static action representations and show no temporal correspondence to the video. Additionally, state space models show superior alignment to intermediate posterior activity through mid-level action features, in which self-supervised pretraining is also beneficial. We draw a metaphor to a dynamic mixture of expert models for the changing neural preference in tasks and temporal integration reflected in the alignment to different model types across time. We posit that a single best-aligned model would need task-independent training to combine these capacities as well as an architecture that supports dynamic switching.

">Episodic memories enable powerful algorithms for goal-directed decision making that are context-aware and explainable</a></h4>

              
                Current AI tools are often criticized for their lack of content-awareness and explainability. This make their planning and action selection sometimes undesirable for a given context, or even unsafe. In contrast, our brains can adjust planning and action selection on the fly to the current context, and often make their action selection transparent by recalling related experiences. This capability results from a fundamental difference between the way how brains and current AI tools store learnt knowledge. Whereas the latter compress all experiences into parameter values, the brain also stores representations of the most salient experiences in the form of episodic memories, which support more sophisticated action selection and planning. We show that experimental data on neural codes for episodic memories in area CA1 of the brain support a method for reproducing these capabilities in artificial devices. The resulting Episodic Neighbor(EN)-algorithm complements reinforcement learning approaches by adding inherent flexibility, context-awareness, and explainability. In addition, the EN-algorithm only needs local rules for synaptic plasticity with binary weights in shallow neural networks, and can therefore be implemented through on-chip learning in energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

">Bimanual Postural Similarity Facilitates Haptic Memory-Guided Reaching</a></h4>

              
                In the visual domain, the precision of memory-guided reaching movements gradually decays as the delay between vision withdrawal and movement onset increases. Such a decrease is often linked to the impact of visual memory decay and the sensory transformation of visual target positional information into haptic-specific coordinates. It is, however, unclear whether this holds for haptically encoded spatial locations, where the target and reaching arm positions are both defined through haptics. Here, we asked participants to perform memory-guided right-handed reaching movements toward targets held with the left hand. In the Delay block, the left hand was removed after 2 seconds, and a right-handed reach was performed after a variable delay of 2, 4, or 6 seconds. In the No-delay block, the left hand was on the target for the entire duration of the trial. Targets were positioned in front (Center) and to the Left of the participants, such that the posture of the left arm during encoding was either the same or different from the final posture of the contralateral reaching arm. The introduction of the shortest delay caused a decrease in accuracy and precision, indicating that on-line haptic inputs play a crucial role in guiding reaching movements. However, performance did not worsen with longer delays, particularly when the two arms were in similar postures. Our findings suggest that postural information may contribute to guiding actions when on-line haptic feedback is unavailable.

">Statistics of correlations in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.

">Frame Effects Across Space and Time</a></h4>

              
                When two probes are flashed at different times within a moving frame they can be perceived as dramatically separated from each other even though they are at the same location in the display. This effect suggests that we perceive object position relative to the surrounding frame even when it is moving (Ozkan et al., 2021). Here, 8 experiments reveal new properties of this frame effect. First, the influence of the frame on the perceived probe positions extends beyond its bounding contours by several degrees of visual angle, both in the direction of the frame's motion and in the direction orthogonal to the motion. It is also undiminished when the probes and the frame are in different depth planes. Unlike the spread of the effect in space, the influence of the frame's motion shows no extension in time - there is no the effect on probes presented after the frame is removed and none retroactively before the frame appears either. The frame's effect is also driven primarily by the displacement of the frame, not by its motion signals: the effect is stronger for moving bounded frames compared to moving, unbounded random-dot textures. When the bounded region has an internal texture that moves with or against the frame's motion or remains static, it is the displacement of the frame that produces the perceived position shifts of the probes, while the effect of the internal motion is mostly suppressed. The frame's influence is unaffected by whether the motion is self-initiated or not and does not reduce in strength across 2 hours of testing.

">Control of Synaptic Communication through Molecularly Engineered Bioluminescence Light Emission and Sensing</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are sites of intercellular communication between neurons and from neurons to target organs, and of signal integration that underly physiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a modular platform, Interluminescence (Int), for experimental control of synaptic transmission: bioluminescent light, generated by a luciferase oxidizing a luciferin, from a presynaptic neuron is used to activate transsynaptic optogenetic ion channels in the postsynaptic neuron. Two strategies can activate or silence postsynaptic neurons in vivo in the presence of luciferin. In the Act-Int approach, a luciferase is genetically expressed in synaptic vesicles and released during depolarization-induced presynaptic vesicle fusion and exocytosis. In the Persist-Int approach, a luciferase is tethered to the presynaptic membrane where it can support sustained transsynaptic signaling. Both strategies can activate postsynaptic neurons with similar efficacy. By design, the modularity of the platform permits the use of luciferases and opsins ranging in brightness and light sensitivity, and the luciferase can be targeted to different subcellular regions of the presynaptic neuron. Our results demonstrate the utility and versatility of Interluminescence to mediate synapse-specific transmission that is either activity-dependent or activity-independent.

">Alternative splicing of synaptotagmin 7 regulates oligomerization and short-term synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is crucial for learning and memory. The presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 (syt7) regulates aspects of short-term plasticity (STP), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that alternative splicing of the syt7 juxtamembrane linker acts as a molecular switch at both biochemical and functional levels. The  and {beta} variants undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form condensates, while the {gamma} variant forms aggregates. Using iGluSnFR imaging, we found that when expressed at equal levels, these three isoforms also diverge regarding their abilities to regulate two key aspects of STP: paired-pulse facilitation and synaptic depression. Further, MINFLUX super resolution microscopy demonstrated that syt7 forms clusters in the active zone, well-positioned to directly control synaptic vesicle dynamics. Thus, alternative splicing might fine-tune STP by differentially impacting syt7 oligomerization.

">Voice Changes in Aging Birdsong: A Longitudinal Study in Adult Male Zebra Finches</a></h4>

              
                By 2030, 1.4 billion people worldwide will be 60 years or older. A significant proportion will experience changes in voice, which can indicate early signs of neurodegenerative disease. Most research and treatment studies have focused on the larynx because of its accessibility and known role in moderating pitch, loudness, and voice quality. Pre-clinical animal models offer important insight into brain mechanisms involved in aging vocalizations. Previously, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis in adult male zebra finches, discovering that song changes occur at transitional timepoints, between young adult, middle age, and older ages. Song changes are accompanied by re-organization of gene networks in a song-dedicated basal ganglia brain nucleus at middle age that degrade in old age. To more precisely examine how aging alters songs during these transitional timepoints, we followed individual male zebra finches longitudinally over adulthood. Measurements of aging human voice, including duration, intensity, smoothed cepstral peak prominence, and fundamental frequency (fo mean, median, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation), were carried out on birdsong syllables. Our results show that changes in fo mean and intensity are the measurements most sensitive to aging and consistent across multiple mornings in the finches. Notably, acoustic changes were also more pronounced in the transition from young adult to middle age, a time at which changes in aging voice also emerge. Our findings strengthen the validity of the finch model for use in aging research and motivate future investigations exploring the relative contributions of laryngeal and brain mechanisms to aging vocalizations.

">Dentate spikes comprise a continuum of relative input strength from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal dentate spikes (DS) are synchronous population events generated in the dentate gyrus thought to support memory processing. DS are classified into type 1 (DS1) and type 2 (DS2) based on current sinks in the outer or middle molecular layer, where the axons of the lateral or medial entorhinal cortex terminate, respectively. This widely used classification method constrains DS into a bimodal distribution without properly testing whether such constraint is appropriate. Here we utilized silicon probe recordings with high spatial resolution spanning all layers of the dentate gyrus and discovered that the contribution of LEC/MEC inputs to DS follows a continuous distribution. We introduce a third type (DS3) that captures a previously unreported component of the distribution: simultaneous current sinks in the outer/middle molecular layer, suggestive of synchronized activation from the LEC/MEC which could facilitate binding. We verify DS3 in several data sets from independent laboratories and characterize their brain state dependence and neural recruitment.

In the TUD group, increased functional connectivity was observed in the superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor cortex, right precentral gyrus, cingulate gyrus, anterior division, postcentral gyrus, thalamus r, and thalamus I. In contrast, decreased functional connectivity was observed in the right lateral occipital cortex (the inferior and superior division), right occipital fusiform gyrus, and the right occipital pole.

Three conditions of pre-tDCS, short-tDCS, and long-tDCS accompanied with event-related potential, brain network and behavioral data are applied to investigate the effect. Results show that the tDCS enhances the P300 components in prefrontal and parietal regions, with significantly higher amplitudes and shorter latencies than pre-tDCS. The brain network connectivity also increases as well as the subjects respond more accurately and quickly. Moreover, females exhibit greater changes in P3 amplitude and mean potential area than males, suggesting higher sensitivity to the tDCS. These findings indicate that the tDCS could enhance memory by increasing cortical excitability and neural efficiency and this study provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms behind the enhanced memory function of the tDCS and introduces a novel framework for its evaluation.</span>

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vanishing white matter is a leukodystrophy with remarkable regional variation in disease severity. The cerebral and cerebellar white matter chronically degenerates, while stress-induced episodes of rapid neurological deterioration coincide with the appearance of acute focal lesions in the deep gray structures and brainstem. With clinical recovery, these acute lesions spontaneously improve or completely resolve on magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting endogenous repair. Repair is not observed in cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Here, we investigated whether differences in cellular pathology might explain the regional variation in repair potential.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed the pathology of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, myelin and axons in postmortem human brain tissue of vanishing white matter patients, who died either during or long after episodes of clinical decline, and of controls. We compared the most severely affected frontal white matter with the least affected pons white matter.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the frontal white matter, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes were abnormal with evident failure of their mature functions, whereas in the pons white matter, their morphology was relatively preserved with evidence of better preserved functions, suggesting that differences in neuropathology underlie the divergent regional potential for intrinsic repair.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Loss of glial cell functions in the cerebral white matter relates to irreversible degeneration, whereas preserved glial functions and valid inflammatory response in the pons coincide with spontaneous repair in vanishing white matter. Unraveling the cellular behavior underlying the potential for repair in the pons could pave the way to novel treatment strategies for this still incurable disease. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>This study aims to examine the changes in AQP4 polarity and pericyte vascularity during temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression, with the goal of identifying potential drug targets or strategies to delay the onset and progression of TLE. Chronic TLE was induced in male rats using pilocarpine. AQP4 polarity and pericyte vascular coverage were assessed by immunofluorescence. The effects of modulating AQP4 polarity on PTZ-induced TLE model using male mice were studied. Molecular mechanisms of AQP4 polarity were explored using transwell coculture and transcriptomics, validated at the protein level. ELISA was used to measure PDGF-BB levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Following pilocarpine-induced chronic TLE model establishment, AQP4 polarity and pericyte vascular coverage rapidly increased but later declined, reaching the lowest levels in epileptic animals. Trifluoperazine prevented AQP4 redistribution, reduced seizure duration, and alleviated brain edema in PTZ-induced TLE mouse model. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pericyte coculture did not alter the expression of dystrophin-associated protein components in astrocytes. Pericyte LAMA1 and LAMA2 levels were significantly higher than endothelial cells, and the levels of pericyte LAMA1 and LAMA2 were significantly increased after coculture with astrocytes. Expression of LAMA1 and LAMA2 around pericytes initially increased and then decreased during chronic TLE progression. PDGF-BB levels decreased over time, reaching the lowest levels during epilepsy. Disrupted AQP4 polarity is closely associated with TLE development. Pericyte vascular coverage appears to influence AQP4 polarity, and key molecules such as laminins and PDGF-BB may help maintain AQP4 polarity, potentially contributing to the attenuation of TLE progression and epileptogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/10/ENEURO.0237-25.2025?rss=1">Interference between Flexible and Adaptive Reaching Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans rapidly update the control of an ongoing movement following changes in contextual parameters. This involves adjusting the controller to exploit redundancy in the movement goal, such as when reaching for a narrow or wide target, and adapting to dynamic changes such as velocity-dependent force fields (FFs). Although flexible control and motor adaptation are computationally distinct, the fact that both unfold within the same movement suggests that they interact functionally to support task-specific adjustments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments combining changes in the target structure and a force field presented separately or in combination. Seventy-six human participants (both sexes) took part in this study, with each experiment involving different participants. They were asked to reach for a target that could change from a narrow square to a wide rectangle between or during trials. Step loads were used to assess whether participants exploited target redundancy. In a separate experiment, we added a force field in addition to target changes and step loads. Our results revealed a reduced ability to exploit target redundancy when sudden target changes occurred concurrently with FF adaptation. Furthermore, the magnitude of adaptation was reduced when step loads were added to the FF. Crucially, this interference emerged specifically when all perturbations impacted motor execution simultaneously. These results indicate that flexible control and motor adaptation interact in a nontrivial manner, suggesting interdependence between these behavioral mechanisms, and a clear identification of the timescale at which they are engaged&mdash;namely, during movement.</p>

                <p>by Ching-Mei Wen, Eleftherios Papoutsakis, Marianthi Ierapetritou</p>

Metabolic network modeling, especially Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), plays a critical role in systems biology by providing insights into cellular behaviors. Although FBA is the main tool for predicting flux distributions, it can face challenges capturing flux variations under different conditions. Selecting an appropriate objective function is therefore important for accurately representing system performance. To address this, we introduce a novel framework (e.g., TIObjFind) that imposes Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MPA) with Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to analyze adaptive shifts in cellular responses throughout different stages of a biological system. This framework determines Coefficients of Importance (CoIs) that quantify each reaction’s contribution to an objective function, aligning optimization results with experimental flux data. By examining Coefficients of Importance, TIObjFind enhances the interpretability of complex metabolic networks and provides insights into adaptive cellular responses.

                <p>by Yijun Mao, Yurong Weng, Jian Weng, Ming Li, Wanrong Gu, Rui Pang, Xudong Lin, Yunyan Xiong, Deyu Tang</p>

Accurately predicting the functions of multi-functional therapeutic peptides is crucial for the development of related drugs. However, existing peptide function prediction methods largely rely on either a single type of feature or a single model architecture, limiting prediction accuracy and applicability. Additionally, training better-performing models on datasets with class imbalance issues remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose the multi-functional therapeutic peptide of multi-feature fusion prediction (MFTP_MFFP) model, a novel method for predicting the functionality of multi-functional therapeutic peptides. This approach uses various encoding techniques to process peptide sequence data, generating multiple features that help the model learn hidden information within the sequences. To maximize the effectiveness of these features, we propose a gated feature fusion module that efficiently integrates them. The module assigns learnable gating weights to each feature, optimizing integration and enhancing fusion efficiency. The fused features are then passed into a neural network model for feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a marginal focal dice loss function (MFDL) to address the class imbalance and improve the model’s prediction performance. Experimental results show that the MFTP_MFFP model outperforms existing models in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in multi-functional therapeutic peptide prediction tasks.

                <p>by Marc M. Himmelberg, Yuna Kwak, Marisa Carrasco, Jonathan Winawer</p>

Primary visual cortex (V1) has long served as a model system for understanding cortical organization. Although its structural and functional properties vary markedly across its surface, patterns of covariation suggest possible underlying constancies. Such constancies would imply that V1 is composed of multiple identical units whose visual properties differ only due to differences in their inputs. To test this, we used fMRI to investigate how V1 cortical magnification and preferred spatial frequency covary with eccentricity and polar angle, measured in 40 observers. V1 cortical magnification and preferred spatial frequency were strongly correlated across eccentricity and around polar angle, however their relation differed between these dimensions: they were proportional across eccentricity but not polar angle. The constant ratio of cortical magnification to preferred spatial frequency when measured as a function of eccentricity suggests a shared underlying cause of variation in the two properties, e.g., the gradient of retinal ganglion cell density across eccentricity. In contrast, the deviation from proportionality around polar angle implies that cortical variation differs from that in retina along this dimension. Thus, a constancy hypothesis is supported for one of the two spatial dimensions of V1, highlighting the importance of examining the full 2D-map to understand how V1 is organized.

                <p>by Anna Demchenko, Maxim Balyasin, Elena Kondratyeva, Tatiana Kyian, Alyona Sorokina, Marina Loguinova, Svetlana Smirnikhina</p>

Respiratory organoids have emerged as a powerful <i>in vitro</i> model for studying respiratory diseases and drug discovery. However, the high-throughput analysis of organoid images remains a challenge due to the lack of automated and accurate segmentation tools. This study presents a semi-automatic algorithm for image analysis of respiratory organoids (nasal and lung organoids), employing the U-Net architecture and CellProfiler for organoids segmentation. The algorithm processes bright-field images acquired through z-stack fusion and stitching. The model demonstrated a high level of accuracy, as evidenced by an intersection-over-union metric (IoU) of 0.8856, F1-score = 0.937 and an accuracy of 0.9953. Applied to forskolin-induced swelling assays of lung organoids, the algorithm successfully quantified functional differences in Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR)-channel activity between healthy donor and cystic fibrosis patient-derived organoids, without fluorescent dyes. Additionally, an open-source dataset of 827 annotated respiratory organoid images was provided to facilitate further research. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of high-throughput respiratory organoid analysis for future therapeutic screening applications.

                <p>by Li-Bo Zhang, Xin-Yi Geng, Li Hu</p>

Neural activity varies dramatically across time. While such neural variability has been associated with cognition, its relationship with pain remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigated the relationship between neural variability and pain, particularly individual differences in pain intensity discriminability, in six large electroencephalography (EEG) datasets (total <i>N</i> = 633), where healthy volunteers (Datasets 1–5; <i>N</i> = 606) and postherpetic neuralgia patients (Dataset 6; <i>N</i> = 27) received painful or nonpainful sensory stimuli. We found robust correlations between neural variability and interindividual pain intensity discriminability. These correlations were replicable in multiple datasets and seemed not to be caused by stimulus-general factors, as no significant correlations were observed in nonpain modalities. Importantly, variability and amplitude of EEG responses were mutually independent and had distinct temporal and oscillatory profiles in encoding pain intensity discriminability. These findings demonstrate that neural variability is a replicable and potentially preferential indicator of individual differences in pain intensity discriminability, thereby enhancing the understanding of neural encoding of pain intensity discriminability and underscoring the value of neural variability in pain studies.

                <p>by Sha Zhang, Davinder Singh, Yi-Hua Zhu, Katherine J. Zhang, Alejandro Melero, Sophie G. Martin, Jian-Qiu Wu</p>

Cytokinesis requires precise coordination of contractile-ring constriction, vesicle trafficking and fusion to the plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix assembly/remodeling at the cleavage furrow to ensure faithful cell division and maintain cell integrity. These processes and proteins involved are broadly conserved across eukaryotes, yet molecular mechanisms controlling the spatiotemporal pathways of membrane trafficking remain poorly understood. Here, using fission yeast genetics, microscopy, and in vitro binding assays, we identify a conserved module including the Munc13 protein Ync13, F-BAR protein Rga7, and coiled-coil protein Rng10 to be critical for precise and selective vesicle targeting to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis. The module specifically recruits the TRAPP-II but not the exocyst complex to tether vesicles containing the glucan synthases Bgs4 and Ags1 along the cleavage furrow. Ync13 subsequently interacts with the SM protein Sec1 for vesicle fusion. Mutations in this pathway disrupt septum integrity and lead to cell lysis. Our work provides key insights into how membrane trafficking is tightly controlled to maintain cell integrity during cytokinesis.

                Background Obesity is a major consequence of malnutrition and significantly contributes to the global burden of chronic diseases. Currently, there are more overweight and obese individuals than underweight individuals. Increased fiber intake can increase insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation. According to research studies, the average dietary fiber consumption is below the recommended value, and the WHO anticipates that the worldwide obesity prevalence has increased in the past ten years. Aim To evaluate the effect of high dietary fiber intake on insulin resistance, body composition, and weight in overweight and obese middle-aged women. Method This hospital-based study evaluated 500 people during phase 1 to identify the prevalence of insulin resistance among overweight and obese middle-aged women. An RCT with intervention and control arms for 180 individuals is being conducted in Phase 2 to determine the effect of increased dietary fiber consumption on insulin resistance, body composition, and weight in overweight or obese middle-aged women. In the intervention group, women were counselled for 15 min and given a tailored food chart including 40 g of fiber. Women in the control arm will receive a typical food care plan with 25 g of fiber, based on their health status. Each engaged woman received fiber nutritional empowerment. Discussion Increasing dietary fiber consumption can improve insulin resistance, body composition, and weight in middle-aged overweight and obese women. Trial registration The Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2022/01/039074) has registered this study as a clinical trial on January 3, 2022 http://ctri.nic.in

                Bioschemas is a community-driven initiative for enhancing the semantic description and interoperability of life science resources through standardized metadata vocabularies. While initially developed to address needs in diverse life science domains, Bioschemas offers significant untapped potential for improving data harmonization, discoverability, and reusability in fields such as biodiversity research. This white paper details the implementation of Bioschemas across the NFDI4Biodiversity consortium, a collaborative network within Germany’s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) dedicated to improving findability, accessibility, and reusability of biodiversity data. We outline the motivations and strategic value behind adopting Bioschemas, including on the one hand increased discoverability for a diverse audience—from researchers and policymakers to the public and industry—via semantically enriched, machine-actionable metadata that meets FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. And on the other applying Bioschemas as a unifying, cross-disciplinary metadata approach aimed at improving interoperability within national and European data ecosystems such as the NFDI and EOSC and beyond. The paper outlines technical workflows, such as the automated transformation of established biodiversity metadata standards (e.g., ABCD) into Bioschemas-compliant representations, and their integration into core infrastructure components, including the consortium’s search and knowledge graph environments. Concrete implementation scenarios, challenges encountered, and harmonization efforts are presented alongside actionable recommendations for technical and non-technical audiences. The paper ultimately provides a transparent account of consortium-internal practices, strategies for community-wide adoption, and perspectives for ongoing development, positioning Bioschemas as a catalyst for open, interoperable, and future-ready biodiversity data infrastructures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1169/v1?src=rss">Early Adolescent Sexual Behaviors: Peer Pressure, Body Image, Psychopathology, Self-Esteem, and Family Dynamics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Early adolescent sexual behavior has become an increasing concern in developmental psychopathology due to its complex interplay with psychosocial, familial, and individual factors. Previous studies highlight the role of peer norms, body image, and self-esteem in shaping sexual initiation, yet few have examined their combined effects alongside family functioning and emotional adjustment in preadolescent girls. The present study aimed to explore the relationships among peer pressure, body image, psychopathological symptoms, self-esteem, and family dynamics in predicting the age of sexual initiation. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted with 254 female students aged 11–16 years attending public middle schools. Participants completed standardized self-report measures assessing perceived peer pressure, body image satisfaction, psychopathological functioning, self-esteem, and family relationships. Correlational analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to test both direct and mediated effects, with self-esteem and family functioning examined as key mediators. Results Peer pressure and psychopathological symptoms were positively associated with earlier sexual initiation, whereas higher self-esteem and positive family functioning were protective. Body image satisfaction positively influenced self-esteem and indirectly delayed sexual initiation. SEM indicated that psychopathology had both direct and indirect effects (via self-esteem and family functioning) on the timing of sexual behaviors. The model showed an acceptable fit to the data, explaining a substantial portion of the variance in age of initiation. Conclusion Early sexual behaviors among adolescent girls are shaped by a constellation of psychosocial and familial factors. Peer influence and emotional difficulties accelerate sexual onset, whereas strong self-esteem and cohesive family relationships exert protective effects. Interventions promoting self-worth, emotional regulation, and family communication may contribute to healthier developmental trajectories and delayed sexual initiation.

                Background Meta-analysis is central to evidence-based practice, yet conducting comprehensive analyses—especially involving binary outcomes such as risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR)—often demands specialized software and statistical programming skills. These requirements can pose barriers to many researchers. Methods We introduce RRORPair, an open-source R/Shiny web application for RR/OR meta-analysis. Built on widely-used R packages (meta, metafor, dmetar, and ggplot2), it offers an intuitive interface enabling data import via CSV, selection of analytical models, and extensive customization of visual outputs. RRORPair supports classical and Bayesian methods, publication bias detection, heterogeneity diagnostics, meta-regression, and subgroup or cumulative analyses. Results RRORPair provides: Forest plots (standard, JAMA, RevMan5 style) Funnel plots, Egger’s test, trim-and-fill, limit meta-analysis, and p-curve analysis Heterogeneity statistics (I2, τ2), Baujat plots, and influence diagnostics Meta-regression with up to three moderators, cumulative and subgroup analysis Bayesian meta-analysis Outputs include interactive plots and downloadable reports. Conclusions RRORPair is a powerful and user-friendly tool that makes advanced meta-analysis of binary outcomes accessible without programming. It supports robust evidence synthesis and encourages transparency and reproducibility in research.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis assessed the association between ET and time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis. Results In total, 209 patients were included. Mean age was 45.7 ± 3.2 years. ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients. Incorporating ET into diagnostic algorithms may optimize triage, reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, and enhance timely cancer detection.

                Serrano Matos et al. model intergenerational undernutrition with gut microbiota from healthy or undernourished human donors to show prenatal maternal and postnatal offspring microbiota both contribute to growth. Fostering by healthy mothers does not rescue offspring growth, suggesting maternal diet and microbiome during pregnancy are critical to supporting healthy development.

                Brown and colleagues find that Müller glia connect with intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells during development and modulate their activity to enable proper circadian photoentrainment. This study shows a key role for glia-neuron interactions in shaping light-responsive behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99989">Tonotopy is not preserved in a descending stage of auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies based on layer specificity suggest that ascending signals from the thalamus to the sensory neocortex preserve spatially organized information, but it remains unknown whether sensory information descending from sensory neocortex to the thalamus also maintains such spatial organization pattern. By focusing on projection specificity, we mapped the tone response properties of two groups of cortical neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1), based on the relationship between their specific connections to other regions and their function in ascending (thalamocortical recipient [TR] neurons) or descending (corticothalamic [CT] neurons) auditory information. A clear tonotopic gradient was observed among TR neurons, but not CT neurons. Additionally, CT neurons exhibited markedly higher heterogeneity in their frequency tuning and had broader bandwidth than TR neurons. These results reveal that the information flow descending from A1 to the thalamus via CT neurons is not arranged tonotopically, suggesting that the descending information flow possibly contributes to higher-order feedback processing of diverse auditory inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94900">The holocephalan ratfish endoskeleton shares trabecular and areolar mineralization patterns, but not tesserae, with elasmobranchs little skate and catshark</a></h4>

              
                Specific character traits of mineralized endoskeletal tissues need to be clearly defined and comprehensively examined among extant chondrichthyans (elasmobranchs, such as sharks and skates, and holocephalans, such as chimaeras) to understand their evolution. For example, tiles of mineralized polygonal structures called tesserae occur at cartilage surfaces in chondrichthyans, but recent studies showing trabecular mineralization at elasmobranch cartilage surfaces suggest that tesserae are not as common as previously thought. Also, while areolar mineralized tissue in elasmobranchs is generally considered a unique, shared chondrichthyan feature, some chondrichthyan species demonstrate bone-like tissues in both a specific region of tesserae termed the cap zone and continuous (not tiled) mineralized neural arches. To clarify the distribution of specific endoskeletal features among extant chondrichthyans, adult skeletal tissues in a holocephalan chimaera (spotted ratfish) and two elasmobranchs (small-spotted catshark and little skate) were characterized using synchrotron radiation and desktop micro-CT imaging, and histological and immunofluorescent assays. Endoskeletal mineralization in the ratfish, catshark, and little skate varied both quantitively in tissue mineral density (TMD) and qualitatively in the morphology and localization of mineralized structures and tissues. For example, TMD of several skeletal elements was significantly lower in ratfish, compared to catshark and little skate. Trabecular and areolar mineralization were shared among these extant chondrichthyan species, but tesserae and bone-like tissues were not. Interestingly, three separate analyses argued that the adult chimaera endoskeleton has features of the embryonic little skate endoskeleton. Generally, this study proposes specific terminology for character states of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton and infers those states in ancestral chondrichthyans with reference to fossil data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99982">Brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle coordinately contribute to thermogenesis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Endotherms increase the rate of metabolism in metabolic organs as one strategy to cope with a decline in the temperature of the external environment. However, an additional major contributor to maintenance of body temperature in a cold environment is contraction-based thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Here, we show that impairment of hind limb muscle contraction by cast immobilization induced a loss of function of skeletal muscle and activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis as a compensatory mechanism. BAT utilizes free branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) derived from skeletal muscle as an energy substrate for thermogenesis, and interleukin-6 released by skeletal muscle stimulates BCAAs production in muscle for support of BAT thermogenesis. Additionally, this thermoregulatory system between BAT and skeletal muscle may also play an important role in response to cold temperatures or acute stress. Our findings suggest that BAT and skeletal muscle cooperate to maintain body temperature in endotherms.

">INPP5D/SHIP1 is a dual regulator of endo-lysosome function and selective phagocytosis in human microglia</a></h4>

              
                INPP5D, the gene encoding SHIP1, is genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and plays a central role in regulating immune function. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid {beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid {beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

">The Effect of Physical Activity Level on Age-Related Differences in Responses to Optic Flow Perturbation during Human Walking</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human aging increases the reliance on vision for walking balance due to age-related declines in proprioceptive and vestibular function. Regular physical activity (PA) may reduce the reliance on visual input during walking. This study examined whether PA levels modulate age-related responses to perturbations of the optic flow that is crucial in the control of human locomotion. Methods: Sixty active and inactive younger (YA and YI: 23.3+/-3.91 y) and older adults (OA and OI: 68.3+/-3.98 y; n=15 for each group) walked on a treadmill in front of a virtual hallway. The walking protocol consisted of 3-minute walking without, and 8-minute with mediolateral optic flow perturbation. Sacrum and heel marker positions and ground reaction forces were recorded. Power spectral density (PSD) of the mediolateral sacrum position and gait parameters were analyzed. Results: The PSD increased more in OA compared to OI adults (p=0.041) while YA and YI adults did not differ. Mean (and variability of) step width and mediolateral margin of stability increased irrespective of age and PA (all p<0.001). During the 8-minute perturbation, OA adults demonstrated greater decreases in PSD than the OI adults (p=0.039). Additionally, the variability in the mediolateral margin of stability reduced more in YA and OA adults compared to YI and OI adults (p=0.048). Conclusion: Higher PA levels in OA adults were associated with stronger immediate responses in body sway to optic flow perturbations compared to older inactive and younger adults. This may support the beneficial effects of physical activity on age-related visual dependency during gait.

">Neuronal glycolytic reprogramming drives lethality via accelerated aging in a Drosophila model of tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurometabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies. Whether these changes drive pathology or represent compensatory, protective responses remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that human tau induces Warburg-like metabolism in Drosophila neurons, characterized by coordinated upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase that mirrors metabolic signatures in human AD. Despite intact mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, tau-expressing fly neurons preferentially utilize glycolysis for ATP production and operate with diminished metabolic reserve. Crucially, this metabolic reprogramming drives rather than protects against pathology as genetic suppression of glycolysis or lactate dehydrogenase completely rescued tau-induced lethality. Further, Gompertz mortality analysis revealed that hyperactive glycolysis in tau neurons drives premature lethality by accelerating biological aging rate without affecting baseline mortality. Collectively, these findings establish aberrant neuronal glycolysis as a cause rather than a consequence of tau pathology, and demonstrate that sustained glycolytic metabolism in mature neurons exacts a specific cost in the form of accelerated aging.

">Cognitive modes involved in emotion regulation identified using Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)</a></h4>

              
                Meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified networks of widely distributed brain regions supporting emotion regulation. These overlap with attentional or cognitive control brain networks. The literature is short on data speaking to specific neurocognitive functions of these broad brain networks in reappraisal - a key emotion regulatory strategy involving the reframing of an event according to a goal to increase or decrease experienced emotion. We address this gap by examining both the spatial configuration and temporal profile of event-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during a task requiring reappraisal. We analysed fMRI datasets obtained from 84 participants (51% female) who were instructed to increase or decrease their emotional response to unpleasant images. We extracted spatial maps and their estimated temporal event-related BOLD signal changes of four components with the highest loadings. Neurocognitive functions were derived by mapping each component onto templates of previously identified task-based cognitive modes. This analysis yielded four cognitive modes: 1) multiple demand, 2) response, 3) re-evaluation, and 4) default mode. The temporal profiles showed particularly prominent patterns for the increase and decrease conditions in multiple demand (mode 1) and re-evaluation (mode 3) respectively. These findings highlight a central role for specific neurocognitive processes linked to attentional control (multiple demand) and switching (re-evaluation), as part of the broad brain networks supporting reappraisal. Moreover, the level of neural engagement of these cognitive modes varies depending on the regulatory goal. These findings provide tangible targets for neurocognitive interventions such as neurostimulation when emotion regulation is compromised.

">Cortical neuroprostheses improve auditory coding and perception compared to cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants have transformed the treatment of hearing loss by enabling auditory perception through direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, their effectiveness can be limited in noisy environments, for fine frequency resolution, and in patients lacking an intact auditory nerve. The auditory cortex offers a promising alternative target for neuroprosthetic stimulation, but it remains unclear whether direct cortical input can evoke percepts with the complexity and structure of natural sounds. Here we show that surface cortical implants in mice support robust and flexible auditory behaviour, surpassing cochlear implants in tasks requiring fine spectral, temporal, and noise-resistant discrimination. We also show that animals generalize seamlessly between cortical and acoustic stimuli without additional training, indicating that cortical stimulation can generate interpretable, sound-like percepts. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that cortical stimulation drives spatially and temporally structured neural activity in auditory cortex, resembling responses to natural sound. These findings establish that the auditory cortex can interpret spatially and temporally patterned electrical input in a behavioural relevant way. By linking neuroprosthetic stimulation to naturalistic neural representations and behavioural generalization, this work provides a mechanistic and functional foundation for cortical auditory neuroprostheses and points toward new strategies for restoring hearing through direct brain stimulation.

">A non-human primate model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 97% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of the ubiquitous nuclear protein, TDP-43. Current rodent models of this disease fail to replicate the progressive motor weakness and characteristic histopathology, possibly because of fundamental neuroanatomical and genetic differences between rodents and humans. In this study, the TDP-43 protein was overexpressed in the motor neuron pool of the brachioradialis muscle unilaterally in two six-year-old female rhesus macaques, using an intersectional genetics approach involving infection with genetically modified adeno-associated virus. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated delayed signal hyperintensities limited to the injected brachioradialis that persisted for 6-7 weeks, consistent with motor neuron degeneration and denervation of the targeted muscle. At post-mortem, the virus-mediated focal protein overexpression event was found to induce widespread deposits of pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 throughout the cervical spinal cord and motor cortex bilaterally, indicating an ALS-like spread of proteinopathy from the transfection site.

">Self-esteem modulates beneficial causal attributions in the formation of novel self-beliefs</a></h4>

              
                Healthy individuals typically attribute successes to internal causes, such as their abilities, and failures to external factors, like bad luck. In contrast, individuals with depression and low self-esteem are more likely to attribute failures to internal causes and successes to external causes. At the same time, depression and low self-esteem are associated with negatively biased self-related learning and self-beliefs. Although causal attributions have been shown to influence belief formation and updating, the dynamic interaction between real-time attributions and self-related learning remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a validated self-related learning task to investigate how internal versus external attributions of performance feedback affect the formation of self-beliefs and how these processes relate to depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Drawing on a computational model that incorporates prediction error valence and causal attributions, we found that participants updated their self-beliefs less when feedback was attributed to external causes. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem showed a stronger negativity bias in learning. Lower self-esteem was also linked to a reduced self-serving bias in attributions. These findings provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that may contribute to the development and maintenance of negative self-beliefs commonly observed in depression.

">Refinement of locomotor activity is developmentally regulated by dopaminergic signaling in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The refinement of gross motor skills, such as locomotion, during development is conserved across vertebrate species. Our previous work demonstrated, in larval zebrafish, that dopaminergic signaling through the dopamine D2-like family of receptors, specifically the dopamine 4 receptor subtype, was necessary for the developmental transformation of behaviorally relevant locomotor activity from an immature to a mature pattern between 3- and 4-days post-fertilization. In this study, we used a complement of tools, including electrophysiology, pharmacology, in vivo calcium imaging, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to characterize the functional and molecular mechanisms responsible for this dopaminergic-mediated refinement of spinal locomotor activity. The results demonstrate that the dopamine 4 receptor subtype is both present and functional in, at least, a subset of immature larvae. Further, gene expression of all D2-like receptor subtypes, levels of dopamine, and activity of diencephalic dopaminergic neurons are significantly greater in mature larvae compared to immature larvae. The integration of these results provides evidence for the developmental role of dopaminergic signaling, specifically the dopamine receptor 4 subtype, in the refinement of locomotor activity in vertebrates.

">The Intermediate CA1 and CA3 Subfields of the Hippocampus Differentially Encode Social Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Social recognition requires linking information about others to the spatial contexts in which they are encountered, a computation thought to engage the hippocampus. Although this process depends on coordinated activity across the hippocampal network, how specific subfields differentially contribute to social recognition remains unclear. Here, we performed one-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to record endogenous activity from the intermediate CA1 (iCA1) and the intermediate CA3 (iCA3) during a novel behavioral paradigm that disentangles social identity from spatial position. Neurons in both subfields encoded social and spatial variables, but iCA3 neurons more robustly discriminated between novel and familiar conspecifics, suggesting that iCA3 neurons more strongly encoded social novelty than those in the iCA1. In contrast, iCA1 neurons more robustly encoded spatial position, indicating distinct roles for these subfields in processing social-context sensitive information. Longitudinal tracking further revealed that social representations remapped across days in both subfields, whereas spatial representations remained stable. These results identify the iCA3 as a key locus for social novelty encoding and suggest a functional division of labor within the hippocampus, in which stable spatial frameworks in the iCA1 anchor flexible, context-dependent social representations in the iCA3 that support adaptive social memory.

In urethane-anesthetized rodents, frequently used in long-term potentiation experiments in vivo, brain activity alternates between a deactivated state, dominated by slow waves, and an activated state characterized by faster oscillations. However, the interplay between synaptic plasticity and slow wave dynamics within these fluctuating brain states remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether long-term potentiation in the hippocampal–medial prefrontal cortex (CA1-mPFC) circuit, critical for memory processing, modulates cortical slow wave dynamics during urethane anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of CA1 robustly evoked a transient (50 to 200 ms) event of population silence (down states) in the medial prefrontal cortex, which emerged after the typical evoked field post-synaptic potential, and was consistently associated with a slow waves. Importantly, long-term potentiation induction significantly enhanced the CA1-evoked medial prefrontal cortex down states and slowed spontaneous cortical slow wave oscillations, without altering the activated/deactivated brain state proportion. Our findings provide direct evidence of an interaction between synaptic plasticity and cortical slow wave dynamics, laying the groundwork for future studies on the underlying mechanisms of state-dependent synaptic homeostasis.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is a longitudinally extended brain structure characterized by its classic trisynaptic circuit, comprising the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subregions, evident in transverse slices and consistent throughout the hippocampal formation. Traditionally, the hippocampal circuit's intrinsic features have been studied using transverse slices. However, the trisynaptic flow extends beyond the transverse plane; Schaffer collaterals, the excitatory projections from CA3 to CA1, also extend along the longitudinal (septotemporal) axis. Despite the anatomical establishment of Schaffer collaterals' longitudinal projection, its physiological properties remain underexplored. In this study, we recorded the transverse and longitudinal transmission of Schaffer collaterals using photostimulation with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression. Our results revealed that optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs) were significantly smaller in distal CA1 compared to proximal CA1, while optically evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) remained consistent along the longitudinal axis. Additionally, CA1 interneurons mediating feedforward inhibition received smaller oEPSCs in distal planes. These findings indicate that Schaffer collaterals transmit excitatory signals more effectively than inhibitory signals along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>Although clinical and experimental evidence highlight the role of the thalamus in voluntary movement production, the involvement of the thalamus in complex motor tasks such as speech production remains to be elucidated. The present study examined neural activity within the bilateral thalamus in 13 participants (seven females) with essential tremor undergoing awake deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, using three speech tasks of varied complexity [vowel vocalization, a diadochokinetic task (DDK), and sentence repetition]. Low-frequency neural activity (delta/theta band) activity was significantly increased during sentence and DDK compared with vowel vocalization in the bilateral motor thalamus and, to a lesser extent, increased for sentence repetition compared with DDK. Moreover, there was prominent prespeech beta band activity, with a greater decrease in the power of beta activity for sentence compared with DDK and vowel vocalization. The greater low-frequency activity in more complex speech tasks may reflect the allocation of additional cognitive resources to monitor the execution of speech motor plans through cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical pathways in a temporally precise manner. The greater decrease in the power of beta activity prior to the onset of sentence repetition may imply greater involvement of the bilateral thalamus in the planning of complex speech tasks. These findings provide new insights into the role of the bilateral thalamus in speech production and may have clinical implications for neurological disorders that affect speech production.</p>

                <p>Aberrant dopamine transmission is a hallmark of several psychiatric disorders. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display distinct activity states that are regulated by discrete afferent inputs. For example, burst firing requires excitatory input from the mesopontine tegmentum, while dopamine neuron population activity, defined as the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons, is thought to be dependent on inhibitory drive from the ventral pallidum (VP). Rodent models used to study psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, consistently exhibit elevated dopamine neuron population activity, due to decreased tonic inhibition from the VP. However, it remains unclear whether the VP can modulate all dopamine neurons or if only a specific subset of VTA dopamine neurons receive innervation from the VP to be recruited as required. This knowledge is critical for understanding dopamine regulation in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology in male and female rats to record VTA dopamine neurons inhibited by electrical stimulation of the VP. Specifically, VP stimulation inhibited ~22% of spontaneously active dopamine neurons; however, activation of the ventral hippocampus, a modulator of VTA population activity, increased the proportion to ~48%. This increase suggests that VP selectively modulates a subset of dopamine neurons that can be recruited by afferent activation. Anterograde monosynaptic tracing revealed that approximately half of the VTA dopamine neurons receive input from the VP. Taken together, we demonstrate that a subset of VTA dopamine neurons receives monosynaptic input from the VP, providing valuable information regarding the regulation of VTA neuron activity.</p>

                <p>by Jeremy Charlier, Zeinab Sherkatghanad, Vladimir Makarenkov</p>

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive accuracy in complex tasks, particularly in scenarios where data is limited or imbalanced. This study explores the use of similarity-based pre-evaluation as a methodology to identify optimal source datasets for transfer learning, addressing the dual challenge of efficient source-target dataset pairing and off-target prediction in CRISPR-Cas9, while existing transfer learning applications in the field of gene editing often lack a principled method for source dataset selection. We use cosine, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances to evaluate similarity between the source and target datasets used in our transfer learning experiments. Four deep learning network architectures, i.e. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and two traditional machine learning models, i.e. Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), were tested and compared in our simulations. The results suggest that similarity scores are reliable indicators for pre-selecting source datasets in CRISPR-Cas9 transfer learning experiments, with cosine distance proving to be a more effective dataset comparison metric than either Euclidean or Manhattan distances. An RNN-GRU, a 5-layer FNN, and two MLP variants provided the best overall prediction results in our simulations. By integrating similarity-based source pre-selection with machine learning outcomes, we propose a dual-layered framework that not only streamlines the transfer learning process but also significantly improves off-target prediction accuracy.

                <p>by Hao Zhu, Donna K. Slonim</p>

A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of “dropout,” when some transcripts’ expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to improve resilience to zero inflation in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the “dropout” problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem. Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE.

Neuronal activity is organized in collective patterns that are critical for information coding, generation, and communication between neural populations. These patterns are often described in terms of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships. Many methods have been proposed for the quantification of these collective states of dynamic neuronal organization. However, it is difficult to determine which method is best suited for which experimental setting and research question. This choice is further complicated by the fact that most methods are sensitive to a combination of synchrony, oscillations, and other factors; in addition, some of them display systematic biases that can complicate their interpretation. To address these challenges, we adopt a highly comparative approach, whereby spike trains are represented by a diverse library of measures. This enables unsupervised or supervised analysis in the space of measures, or in that of spike trains. We compile a battery of 122 measures of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships, complemented with 9 measures of spiking intensity and variability. We first apply them to sets of synthetic spike trains with known statistical properties, and show that all measures are confounded by extraneous factors such as firing rate or population frequency, but to different extents. Then, we analyze spike trains recorded in different species—rat, mouse, and monkey—and brain areas—primary sensory cortices and hippocampus—and show that our highly comparative approach provides a high-dimensional quantification of collective network activity that can be leveraged for both unsupervised and supervised characterization of firing patterns. Overall, the highly comparative approach provides a detailed description of the empirical properties of multineuron spike train analysis methods, including practical guidelines for their use in experimental settings, and advances our understanding of neuronal coordination and coding.

                <p>by Victor Hugo Mello, Jiri Wald, Thomas C Marlovits, Pablo Sartori</p>

Proteins carry out cellular functions by changing their structure among a few conformations, each characterised by a different energy level. Therefore, structural changes, energy transformations, and protein function are intimately related. Despite its central importance, this relationship remains elusive. For example, while many hexameric ATPase motors are known to function using a hand-over-hand alternation of subunits, how energy transduction throughout the assembly structure drives the hand-over-hand mechanism is not known. In this work, we unravel the energetic basis of hand-over-hand in a model AAA+ motor, RuvB. To do so, we develop a general method to compute the residue-scale elastic pseudoenergy due to structure changes and apply it to RuvB structures, recently resolved through cryo-EM. This allows us to quantify how progression through RuvB’s mechanochemical cycle translates into residue-scale energy transduction. In particular, we find that DNA binding is associated with overcoming a high energy barrier. This is possible through inter-subunit transmission of energy, and ultimately driven by nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we show how this structure-inferred energetic quantification can be integrated into a non-equilibrium model of AAA+ assembly dynamics, consistent with single-molecule biophysics measurements. Overall, our work elucidates the energetic basis for the hand-over-hand mechanism in RuvB’s cycle. Furthermore, it presents a generally applicable methodology for studying the energetics of conformational cycles in other proteins, allowing to quantitatively bridge data from structural biology and single-molecule biophysics.

                <p>by Weifan Wang, Xueyan Niu, Liyuan Liang, Tai-Sing Lee</p>

A ubiquitous phenomenon observed along the ventral stream of the primate hierarchical visual system is the suppression of neural responses to familiar stimuli at the population level. The observation of the suppression of the neural response in the early visual cortex (V1 and V2) to familiar stimuli that are multiple times larger in size than the receptive fields of individual neurons implicates the plausible development of recurrent circuits for encoding these global stimuli. In this work, we investigated the neural mechanisms of familiarity suppression and showed that a recurrent neural circuit based on Hebbian learning, consisting of neurons with small and local receptive fields, can develop to encode specific global familiar stimuli robustly as a result of familiarity training. We proposed that the learned recurrent circuit implements a manifold transform. The recurrent circuit compresses the dimensions of nuisance variations of a familiar image in the neural response manifold relative to the dimensions for discriminating different familiar stimuli, resulting in increased robustness of the global stimulus representation against noise and other irrelevant perturbations. We demonstrate that a recurrent circuit implements the manifold transform using a mixed strategy of locally linear and globally nonlinear computations, where the local linear computation selectively redistributes recurrent gain to enhance concept discrimination. These results provide testable predictions for neurophysiological experiments.

                <p>by Huijuan Zhou, Jun Chen, Xianyang Zhang</p>

Microbiome sequencing data are inherently sparse and compositional, with excessive zeros arising from biological absence or insufficient sampling. These zeros pose significant challenges for downstream analyses, particularly those that require log-transformation. We introduce BMDD (BiModal Dirichlet Distribution), a novel probabilistic modeling framework for accurate imputation of microbiome sequencing data. Unlike existing imputation approaches that assume unimodal abundance, BMDD captures the bimodal abundance distribution of the taxa via a mixture of Dirichlet priors. It uses variational inference and a scalable expectation-maximization algorithm for efficient imputation. Through simulations and real microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that BMDD outperforms competing methods in reconstructing true abundances and improves the performance of differential abundance analysis. Through multiple posterior samples, BMDD enables robust inference by accounting for uncertainty in zero imputation. Our method offers a principled and computationally efficient solution for analyzing high-dimensional, zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data and is broadly applicable in microbial biomarker discovery and host-microbiome interaction studies.

                <p>by Etienne Gosselin, Sophie Bagur, Sara Jamali, Jean-Luc Puel, Jérôme Bourien, Brice Bathellier</p>

Early studies on orientation selectivity in the visual cortex have suggested that sensory systems generate new feature representations at specific processing stages. Many observations challenge this view, but in the absence of systematic, multistage measurements, the logic of how feature tuning emerges remains elusive. Here, using a generic approach based on representational similarity analysis with a noise-corrected population metric, we demonstrate in the mouse auditory system that feature representations evolve gradually with, in some cases, major, feature-specific improvements at particular stages. We observe that single frequency tuning is already fully developed in the cochlear nucleus, the first stage of processing, while tuning to higher-order features improves up to the auditory cortex, with major steps in the inferior colliculus for amplitude modulation frequency or noise bandwidth tuning and in the cortex for frequency modulation direction and for complex sound identity or direction. Moreover, we observe that intensity tuning is established in a feature-ependent manner, earlier for pure frequencies than for more complex sounds. This indicates that auditory feature computations are a mix of stepwise and gradual processes which together contribute to decorrelate sound representations.

Understanding how transcription factors regulate organized cellular diversity in developing tissues remains a major challenge due to their pleiotropic functions. We addressed this by monitoring and genetically modulating the activity of PAX3 and PAX7 during the specification of neural progenitor pools in the embryonic spinal cord. Using mouse models, we show that the balance between the transcriptional activating and repressing functions of these factors is modulated along the dorsoventral axis and is instructive to the patterning of spinal progenitor pools. By combining loss-of-function experiments with functional genomics in spinal organoids, we demonstrate that PAX-mediated repression and activation rely on distinct <i>cis-</i>regulatory genomic modules. This enables both the coexistence of their dual activity in dorsal cell progenitors and the specific control of two major differentiation programs. PAX promote H3K27me3 deposition at silencers to repress ventral identities, while at enhancers, they act as pioneer factors, opening and activating <i>cis-</i>regulatory modules to specify dorsal-most identities. Finally, we show that this pioneer activity is restricted to cells exposed to BMP morphogens, ensuring spatial specificity. These findings reveal how PAX proteins, modulated by morphogen gradients, orchestrate neuronal diversity in the spinal cord, providing a robust framework for neural subtype specification.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess whether their combination improves diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively analyzed 293 ALS patients, 85 neurodegenerative disease controls, and 29 healthy controls. A validation cohort of 501 ALS patients was analyzed to confirm reproducibility of the results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for sNfL, cTnT, and their combination, and the area under the curve (AUC) was compared across groups. An ALS-specific cTnT cut-off of 8.35ng/L was determined using the Youden index and applied in subgroup analyses, in which “biomarker-negative” ALS patients were compared to “biomarker-positive” patients regarding disease duration and progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sNfL showed excellent performance in discriminating ALS patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.94), but only moderate performance in discriminating neurodegenerative disease controls (AUC = 0.82). Combining sNfL and cTnT improved diagnostic accuracy for ALS over neurodegenerative controls, with an AUC of 0.90, whereas cTnT alone showed an AUC of 0.77. The validation cohort showed similar AUCs. “Biomarker-negative” ALS patients had a longer disease duration (73.0 vs 18.0 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0003) and a lower progression rate (0.19 vs 0.70 points per months, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than “biomarker-positive” patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although sNfL alone performs well in distinguishing ALS from healthy controls, repurposing cTnT for ALS provides additional value in discriminating ALS from disease controls. The combination of sNfL and cTnT improves diagnostic accuracy and may help identify prognostically distinct ALS subgroups. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Aim This study aims to compare the isokinetic strength of the Hamstrings against the Quadriceps for Football, Cricket, and Tennis among semi-professional athletes. Methodology An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with the inclusion of participants between 18-40 years, both males and females having an active athlete profile playing Football, Cricket, and Tennis as semi-professional (competing in inter-collegiate, national-level tournaments in the UAE). The minimum duration for each sport was one hour per day and three to five times per week. A total of 66 participants were enrolled, with 22 participants in each group. The ISOMOVE isokinetic device was used to assess the strength of dynamically contracting Quadriceps concentrically against eccentric contraction of the Hamstring muscles to determine the functional ratio (H/Q ratio). Results Age-wise distribution of players showed predominant male participants with 77.3% of players in Football, 68.2% in Cricket, and 59.1% in Tennis. The comparison for the mean peaks of isokinetic strength for functional ratio suggested a statistically significant difference between the three sports (Football p<0.001, Cricket p=0.006, Tennis p =0.003). The findings suggested that the highest H/Q ratio was found in Football players with a mean value of 0.51±0.07, followed by Cricket and Tennis with a mean of 0.48±0.08 and 0.42±0.05, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion The isokinetic strength testing for H/Q ratio was found to be higher in Football players, followed by Cricket and Tennis players for semi-professional athletes. The study concluded that the functional H/Q ratio varies between three similar sports as the demand on the target muscle would specifically vary. Thus, semi-professional players who play multiple games should consider enhancing FR for the Hamstring to the Quadriceps, besides the strength and training specific to sports, to avoid the risk of injuries.

                Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to HPV-related cancers such as cervical cancer and other cancers such as anal, vaginal, and penile cancer. HPV rarely produces symptoms and cannot be cured or treated; therefore, vaccination is essential to protect against HPV and HPV-related diseases. However, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter, respectfully, ‘Aboriginal’) people are not receiving their HPV vaccine dose, resulting in missed opportunities to be protected from HPV-related cancers. Health promotion is a critical way to empower people to take ownership over and control their health and is a core function of public health. One way to deliver health promotion is through social media platforms. In recent COVID-19 times, we have seen the effect of social media on public health messaging, both positive and harmful. In particular, Instagram influencers have had a profound impact on pro- and anti-vaccination messages. Aboriginal adolescents aged 13-15 years old have strong engagement with social media platforms. Combining co-created health promotion messages with local ‘micro-Influencers’ is a novel way to improve HPV vaccination rates. The overall aim of this project is to improve the rates of HPV vaccination amongst young Aboriginal people. We will achieve this through: i) co-creation of health promotion messages, ii) developing and delivering a social media campaign and iii) evaluating the effectiveness of the campaign through an interrupted time-series design. We hypothesise that the co-creation of health promotion messages with young Aboriginal people and their families and utilising the skills of micro-Influencers to engage and influence their followers will result in improvements HPV vaccination rates amongst this population.

                Background The use of ensemble learning has been crucial for improving predictive accuracy in healthcare, especially with regard to critical diagnostic and classification problems. Ensemble models combine the strengths of multiple ML models and reduce the risk of misclassification, which is important in healthcare, where accurate predictions impact patient outcomes. Methods This study introduces the Gradient-Based Weight Optimized Ensemble Model (GBWOEM), an advanced ensemble technique that optimizes the weights of five base models: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), through optimizing the weights. Two variants, GBWOEM-R (random weight initialization) and GBWOEM-U (uniform weight initialization), were proposed and tested on five healthcare-related datasets: breast cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, diabetic retinopathy debrecen, obesity level estimation based on physical condition and eating habits, and thyroid diseases. Results The test accuracy of the proposed models increased to 0.48-8.26% over the traditional ensemble models, such as Adaboost, Catboost, GradientBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Performance metrics, including ROC-AUC analyses, confirmed the model’s efficacy in handling imbalanced data, highlighting its potential for advancing predictive consistency in healthcare applications. Conclusion The GBWOEM model improves the predictive accuracy and offers a reliable solution for healthcare applications even when dealing with the imbalance data. This strategy has the potential to ensure patient outcomes and diagnostic consistency in healthcare settings.

                This study introduces a robust numerical method for addressing the fourth-order Fisher-Kolmogorov reaction-diffusion equation, employing a combination of quintic Hermite splines and Richardson extrapolation. The proposed technique effectively transformed the original equation into a system of linear and nonlinear equations, achieving sixth-order convergence in space and fourth-order convergence in time. A thorough stability analysis confirmed the unconditional stability of the method, ensuring that the numerical solutions remained accurate throughout various perturbation scenarios. Extensive numerical experiments validated the performance of the method, revealing significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing approaches. The findings underscore the applicability of the method in mathematical biology and related fields, where the precise modelling of dynamic processes is crucial. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of numerical techniques for complex differential equations, demonstrating enhanced reliability and precision in computational simulations.
