              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Automated Detection and Localization of Synaptic Vesicles in Electron Microscopy Images</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Information transfer and integration in the brain occurs at chemical synapses and is mediated by the fusion of synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter. Synaptic vesicle dynamic spatial organization regulates synaptic transmission as well as synaptic plasticity. Because of their small size, synaptic vesicles require electron microscopy (EM) for their imaging, and their analysis is conducted manually. The manual annotation and segmentation of the hundreds to thousands of synaptic vesicles, is highly time consuming and limits the throughput of data collection. To overcome this limitation, we built an algorithm, mainly relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), capable of automatically detecting and localizing synaptic vesicles in electron micrographs. The algorithm was trained on murine synapses but we show that it works well on synapses from different species, ranging from zebrafish to human, and from different preparations. As output, we provide the vesicle count and coordinates, the nearest neighbor distance (nnd) and the estimate of the vesicles area. We also provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through image analysis, result visualization, and manual proof-reading. The application of our algorithm is especially recommended for images produced by transmission EM. Since this type of imaging is used routinely to investigate presynaptic terminals, our solution will likely be of interest for numerous research groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Arcuate Angiotensin II Increases Arterial Pressure via Coordinated Increases in Sympathetic Nerve Activity and Vasopressin Secretion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The arcuate nucleus (ArcN) is an integrative hub for the regulation of energy balance, reproduction, and arterial pressure (AP), all of which are influenced by Angiotensin II (AngII); however, the cellular mechanisms and downstream neurocircuitry are unclear. Here, we show that ArcN AngII increases AP in female rats via two phases, both of which are mediated via activation of AngII type 1 receptors (AT1aRs): initial vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction, followed by slowly developing increases in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and heart rate (HR). In male rats, ArcN AngII evoked a similarly slow increase in SNA, but the initial pressor response was variable. In females, the effects of ArcN AngII varied during the estrous cycle, with significant increases in SNA, HR, and AP occurring during diestrus and estrus, but only increased AP during proestrus. Pregnancy markedly increased the expression of AT1aR in the ArcN with parallel substantial AngII-induced increases in SNA and MAP. In both sexes, the sympathoexcitation relied on suppression of tonic ArcN sympathoinhibitory neuropeptide Y (NPY) inputs, and activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) projections, to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Few or no NPY or POMC neurons expressed the AT1aR, suggesting that AngII increases AP and SNA at least in part indirectly via local interneurons, which express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VGat (i.e., GABAergic). ArcN TH neurons release GABA locally, and central AT1aR and TH neurons mediate stress responses; therefore, we propose that TH AT1aR neurons are well situated to locally coordinate the regulation of multiple modalities within the ArcN in response to stress.</p>

                Introduction: Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is rare but a potentially lethal adverse event. The pathophysiologic mechanism is still unknown. Patient concerns: A 22-year-old man was admitted for the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome. On day six, he required mechanical ventilation due to progressive muscle weakness; propofol (3.5 mg/kg/hour) was administered for five days for sedation. On day 13, he had hypotension with abnormal electrocardiogram findings, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia and severe rhabdomyolysis. Diagnosis and interventions: The patient was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) on suspicion of PRIS. Administration of noradrenaline and renal replacement therapy and fasciotomy for compartment syndrome of lower legs due to PRIS-rhabdomyolysis were performed. Outcomes: The patient gradually recovered and was discharged from the ICU on day 30. On day 37, he had repeated sinus bradycardia with pericardial effusion in echocardiography. Cardiac 18F-FDG PET on day 67 demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG uptake in the left ventricle. Electron microscopic investigation of endomyocardial biopsy on day 75 revealed mitochondrial myelinization of the cristae, which indicated mitochondrial damage of cardiomyocytes. He was discharged without cardiac abnormality on day 192. Conclusions: Mitochondrial damage in both morphological and functional aspects was observed in the present case. Sustained mitochondrial damage may be a therapeutic target beyond the initial therapy of discontinuing propofol administration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CRBPDL: Identification of circRNA-RBP interaction sites using an ensemble neural network approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengting Niu, Quan Zou, Chen Lin</p>

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with a special circular structure produced formed by the reverse splicing mechanism. Increasing evidence shows that circular RNAs can directly bind to RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and play an important role in a variety of biological activities. The interactions between circRNAs and RBPs are key to comprehending the mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. Accurately identifying binding sites is very useful for analyzing interactions. In past research, some predictors on the basis of machine learning (ML) have been presented, but prediction accuracy still needs to be ameliorated. Therefore, we present a novel calculation model, CRBPDL, which uses an Adaboost integrated deep hierarchical network to identify the binding sites of circular RNA-RBP. CRBPDL combines five different feature encoding schemes to encode the original RNA sequence, uses deep multiscale residual networks (MSRN) and bidirectional gating recurrent units (BiGRUs) to effectively learn high-level feature representations, it is sufficient to extract local and global context information at the same time. Additionally, a self-attention mechanism is employed to train the robustness of the CRBPDL. Ultimately, the Adaboost algorithm is applied to integrate deep learning (DL) model to improve prediction performance and reliability of the model. To verify the usefulness of CRBPDL, we compared the efficiency with state-of-the-art methods on 37 circular RNA data sets and 31 linear RNA data sets. Moreover, results display that CRBPDL is capable of performing universal, reliable, and robust. The code and data sets are obtainable at https://github.com/nmt315320/CRBPDL.git.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine-scale estimation of effective reproduction numbers for dengue surveillance</a></h4>

The effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> is an epidemiological quantity that provides an instantaneous measure of transmission potential of an infectious disease. While dengue is an increasingly important vector-borne disease, few have used <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> as a measure to inform public health operations and policy for dengue. This study demonstrates the utility of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> for real time dengue surveillance. Using nationally representative, geo-located dengue case data from Singapore over 2010–2020, we estimated <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> by modifying methods from Bayesian (EpiEstim) and filtering (EpiFilter) approaches, at both the national and local levels. We conducted model assessment of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> from each proposed method and determined exogenous temporal and spatial drivers for <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> in relation to a wide range of environmental and anthropogenic factors. At the national level, both methods achieved satisfactory model performance (R<sup>2</sup><sub>EpiEstim</sub> = 0.95, R<sup>2</sup><sub>EpiFilter</sub> = 0.97), but disparities in performance were large at finer spatial scales when case counts are low (MASE <sub>EpiEstim</sub> = 1.23, MASE<sub>EpiFilter</sub> = 0.59). Impervious surfaces and vegetation with structure dominated by human management (without tree canopy) were positively associated with increased transmission intensity. Vegetation with structure dominated by human management (with tree canopy), on the other hand, was associated with lower dengue transmission intensity. We showed that dengue outbreaks were preceded by sustained periods of high transmissibility, demonstrating the potential of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> as a dengue surveillance tool for detecting large rises in dengue cases. Real time estimation of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> at the fine scale can assist public health agencies in identifying high transmission risk areas and facilitating localised outbreak preparedness and response.

Over the last few decades, the nature of life sciences research has changed enormously, generating a need for a workforce with a variety of computational skills such as those required to store, manage, and analyse the large biological datasets produced by next-generation sequencing. Those with such expertise are increasingly in demand for employment in both research and industry. Despite this, bioinformatics education has failed to keep pace with advances in research. At secondary school level, computing is often taught in isolation from other sciences, and its importance in biological research is not fully realised, leaving pupils unprepared for the computational component of Higher Education and, subsequently, research in the life sciences. The 4273pi Bioinformatics at School project (https://4273pi.org) aims to address this issue by designing and delivering curriculum-linked, hands-on bioinformatics workshops for secondary school biology pupils, with an emphasis on equitable access. So far, we have reached over 180 schools across Scotland through visits or teacher events, and our open education resources are used internationally. Here, we describe our project, our aims and motivations, and the practical lessons we have learned from implementing a successful bioinformatics education project over the last 5 years.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Use of Raman and Raman optical activity to extract atomistic details of saccharides in aqueous solution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vladimír Palivec, Christian Johannessen, Jakub Kaminský, Hector Martinez-Seara</p>

Sugars are crucial components in biosystems and industrial applications. In aqueous environments, the natural state of short saccharides or charged glycosaminoglycans is floating and wiggling in solution. Therefore, tools to characterize their structure in a native aqueous environment are crucial but not always available. Here, we show that a combination of Raman/ROA and, on occasions, NMR experiments with Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) is a viable method to gain insights into structural features of sugars in solutions. Combining these methods provides information about accessible ring puckering conformers and their proportions. It also provides information about the conformation of the linkage between the sugar monomers, i.e., glycosidic bonds, allowing for identifying significantly accessible conformers and their relative abundance. For mixtures of sugar moieties, this method enables the deconvolution of the Raman/ROA spectra to find the actual amounts of its molecular constituents, serving as an effective analytical technique. For example, it allows calculating anomeric ratios for reducing sugars and analyzing more complex sugar mixtures to elucidate their real content. Altogether, we show that combining Raman/ROA spectroscopies with simulations is a versatile method applicable to saccharides. It allows for accessing many features with precision comparable to other methods routinely used for this task, making it a viable alternative. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed technique can scale up by studying the complicated Raffinose trisaccharide, and therefore, we expect its wide adoption to characterize sugar structural features in solution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">K-nearest-neighbor algorithm to predict the survival time and classification of various stages of oral cancer: a machine learning approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For years now, cancer treatments have entailed tried-and-true methods. Yet, oncologists and clinicians recommend a series of surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Yet, even amidst these treatments, the number of deaths due to cancer increases at an alarming rate. The prognosis of cancer patients is influenced by mutations, age, and various cancer stages. However, the association between these variables is unclear. Methods: The present work adopts a machine learning technique—k-nearest neighbor; for both regression and classification tasks, regression for predicting the survival time of oral cancer patients, and classification for classifying the patients into one of the predefined oral cancer stages. Two cross-validation approaches—hold-out and k-fold methods—have been used to examine the prediction results.   Results: The experimental results show that the k-fold method performs better than the hold-out method, providing the least mean absolute error score of 0.015. Additionally, the model classifies patients into a valid group. Of the 429 records, 97 (out of 106), 99 (out of 119), 95 (out of 113), and 77 (out of 91) were classified to its correct label as stages – 1, 2, 3, and 4. The accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure for each classification group obtained are 0.84, 0.85, 0.85, and 0.84.   Conclusions: The study showed that aged patients with a higher number of mutations than young patients have a higher risk of short survival. Senior patients with a more significant number of mutations have an increased risk of getting into the last cancer stage

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image.     Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 670 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Aging with long-term physical disability: Cohort analysis of survey sample in the U.S. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chronic health conditions, secondary conditions, and decreasing functional ability related to aging and/or changes in underlying impairment may influence participation for persons aging with long-term physical disability (AwD). Objective: To examine sample integrity and baseline findings through exploration of associations of sociodemographic, health, and disability factors with social participation for persons AwD. Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort study following persons AwD over three years, reporting baseline cohort study data. A convenience sample of 474 persons AwD aged 45–65 reporting physical disability of ≥5 years’ duration was recruited through community organizations and social media. The cohort was majority female (66.7%) and single (62.0%), and over one-third (38.6%) was non-White. Pain, fatigue, depression, ability to participate in, and satisfaction with, social roles and activities were measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Results: Participants aged 55–60 and 61–65 had significantly lower rates of employment and marriage and higher rates of living alone than participants aged 45–54. Participants reported higher rates of fatigue, pain, and depression and lower ability to participate in, and satisfaction with, participation in, social roles and activities than the general population. Ability to participate and satisfaction with participation were highest among Black/African American participants. Conclusions: Participants reported higher rates of common AwD symptoms and lower ability to participate and satisfaction with participation than the general population, consistent with prior studies of AwD samples. This cohort reflects the AwD population and can be considered an AwD sample, comparable to those found in existing literature. The focus of future analyses will be to gain a greater understanding of chronic health conditions, incidence of falls, engagement in everyday life activities, and the impact of the environment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synthetic time series data generation for edge analytics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Internet of Things (IoT) edge analytics enables data computation and  storage to be available adjacent to the source of data generation at the IoT system. This method improves sensor data handling and speeds up analysis, prediction, and action. Using machine learning for analytics and task offloading in edge servers could minimise latency and energy usage. However, one of the key challenges in using machine learning in edge analytics is to find a real-world dataset to implement a more representative predictive model. This challenge has undeniably slowed down the adoption of machine learning methods in IoT edge analytics. Thus, the generation of realistic synthetic datasets can leverage the need to speed up methodological use of machine learning in edge analytics. Methods: We create synthetic data with features that are like data from IoT devices. We use an existing air quality dataset that includes temperature and gas sensor measurements. This real-time dataset includes component values for the Air Quality Index (AQI) and ppm concentrations for various polluting gases. We build a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) model to capture the distribution of variables and the structure of this real dataset to generate the synthetic data. Based on the synthetic dataset and original dataset, we create a comparative predictive model. Results: Analysis of synthetic dataset predictive model shows that it can be successfully used for edge analytics purposes, replacing real-world datasets. There is no significant difference between the real-world dataset compared the synthetic dataset. The generated synthetic data requires no modification to suit the edge computing requirements. Conclusions: The framework can generate representative synthetic datasets based on JSON schema attributes. The accuracy, precision, and recall values for the real and synthetic datasets indicate that the logistic regression model is capable of successfully classifying data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of substance abuse and its associated factors among medical students: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Substance abuse by medical students poses a significant risk not only on their personal life but also on their professional life by putting their patients at risk. Our study aims to find out the prevalence of substance abuse and factors associated with it among medical students. Methods: An online-questionnaire based, cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out at Gandaki Medical College, a medical school in Gandaki Province of Nepal. Whole sampling technique was used. SPSS-25.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for analyzing demographic and substance abuse related variables. Chi square and Fishers exact test was used to find out if any differences existed in substance abuse by demographic characteristics. Results: Among 420 eligible participants, 219 participated in the survey (response rate: 52.2%). Alcohol was the most commonly used substance with overall lifetime prevalence of 58% followed by cigarette smoking and illegal drug abuse at 21.9% and 13.7%, respectively. The abuse of substances was significantly higher (p<0.05) in males, who were offered substances by friends, and amongst study participants who worked with an intoxicated colleague. The most common reason for substance abuse was “For pleasure, curiosity or to go along with friends” (23%, n=18). Major and minor dysfunction due to alcohol abuse was reported by 8(3.7%) and 33(15.1%) participants, while the same dysfunctions due to drug abuse were reported by 1(0.5%) and 14(6.4%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of substance abuse was high among medical students and was found to be associated with male gender, if offer of substances were made by friends, and amongst those who worked with an intoxicated colleague. This problem of substance abuse among medical students should be addressed timely as failing to do so might have serious consequences on the healthcare system of the country.

                Background: This study aimed to propose an experiential approach for understanding color vision variation using virtual reality technology. Methods: The study design was adapted from the phase 1 clinical trial for medical apps. A virtual classroom was developed in a three-dimensional space, and ten healthy university students were tested to understand color vision variations. Results: No participant interrupted the experience due to VR sickness. Most participants noted that the virtual classroom was an excellent educational tool, which could help teachers understand the problems associated with [visual analog scale (VAS): mean ± standard deviation (SD), 9.6 ± 0.6] and obtain a better understanding of (VAS: mean ± SD, 9.0 ± 1.0) color vision deficiencies. Conclusions: A pilot study was conducted on the impact of immersive virtual classroom experiences as an educational tool for color barrier-free presentations. This approach may help the participants to respond appropriately to children who suffer from this disorder. It is necessary to evaluate the impact of this approach on new teachers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease burden and adverse pregnancy outcomes due to cardiovascular conditions complicating pregnancy in Sri Lanka: a protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the commonest indirect medical cause of maternal deaths worldwide, both in high-income and low and middle-income countries. To minimize the effects of CVD in pregnancy, proper risk assessment and appropriate referral is required. In Sri Lanka, cardiovascular disease complicating pregnancy is a significant cause of maternal mortality, second only to postpartum hemorrhage. Screening for CVD in pregnancy in Sri Lanka is limited to a routine clinical assessment. Evidence-based guidelines are yet to be developed, and this deficit may have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the CVD burden. This study aims to determine the burden of CVD in early pregnancy and develop a risk prediction model to be used in field pregnancy clinics in Sri Lanka to reduce CVD effects in pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in the Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Following registration to the antenatal care, pregnant women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were invited to attend a special clinic at their relevant Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Risk assessment was done through history and a clinical examination, and suspected/probable cases were referred for an echocardiogram by a consultant cardiologist. All the recruited participants in the first trimester were prospectively followed up and screened again between 24–28 weeks of the period of amenorrhoea (POA). Antenatal ward admissions with CVD complicating pregnancy will be extracted, and a telephone interview will be carried out between 6–12 weeks after the expected delivery date to cover postpartum morbidities.  Discussion This proposed study will be the largest of its kind carried out in the local setting. The study's findings will be beneficial for policymakers to develop guidelines to reduce maternal cardiovascular disease morbidities and mortalities in Sri Lanka.

                Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by its progression of motor-related symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking and balance. Comorbid conditions in PD individuals include insulin resistance (IR) and narcolepsy-like sleep patterns. The intersecting sleep symptoms of both conditions include excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, insomnia, and falling into REM sleep more quickly than an average person. Understanding of the biological basis and relationship of these comorbid disorders with PD may help with early detection and intervention strategies to improve quality of life. Methods: In this study, an integrative genomics and systems biology approach was used to analyze gene expression patterns associated with PD, IR, and narcolepsy in order to identify genes and pathways that may shed light on how these disorders are interrelated. A correlation analysis with known genes associated with these disorders (LRRK2, HLA-DQB1, and HCRT) was used to query microarray data corresponding to brain regions known to be involved in PD and narcolepsy. This includes the hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, pons, and subcoeruleus nucleus. Risk factor genes for PD, IR, and narcolepsy were also incorporated into the analysis. Results: The PD and narcolepsy signaling networks are connected through insulin and immune system pathways. Important genes and pathways that link PD, narcolepsy, and IR are CACNA1C, CAMK1D, BHLHE41, HMGB1, and AGE-RAGE. Conclusions: We have identified the genetic signatures that link PD with its comorbid disorders, narcolepsy and insulin resistance, from the convergence and intersection of dopaminergic, insulin, and immune system related signaling pathways. These findings may aid in the design of early intervention strategies and treatment regimes for non-motor symptoms in PD patients as well as individuals with diabetes and narcolepsy.

                Background: Plant products, including seeds are an important source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, and energy. This study aimed to assess parasitic contaminations in roasted groundnuts, nabag, and tasali (watermelon seeds) sold by street vendors in Khartoum State, Sudan. Methods: The frequency of parasitic contaminations among all crop products was detected by washing the plants with saline, and then conducting an examination using a formal ether concentration technique (FECT), followed by a saturated sugar floatation technique. Results: The detected parasites belonged to two species: Entamoeba histolytica (33.3%) and Giardia lamblia (15.6%). No helminthic parasites were detected. Mixed contamination of the mentioned parasites was also observed (11.1%). The most contaminated crop was nabag, followed by groundnut, and finally tasali. Conclusion: No relation was established between the positivity of samples for parasites and crop type, Khartoum State city, or  seller sex. FECT was more sensitive than the saturated sugar floatation technique as a detection method.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences disease-related functional and structural changes in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of cognitive control.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home trainer) or stretching (active control) interventions (duration = 6 months). An unselected subset from this trial (exercise, n = 25; stretching, n = 31) underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an oculomotor cognitive control task (pro- and antisaccades), at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Aerobic exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge toward the conclusion that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic sleep disorder correlated with loss of hypocretin(orexin). In NT1 post-mortem brains, we observed 88% reduction in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and significantly less CRH-positive fibers in the median eminence, whereas CRH-neurons in the locus coeruleus and thalamus, and other PVN neuronal populations were spared: that is, vasopressin, oxytocin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and thyrotropin releasing hormone-expressing neurons. Other hypothalamic cell groups, that is, the suprachiasmatic, ventrolateral preoptic, infundibular, and supraoptic nuclei and nucleus basalis of Meynert, were unaffected. The surprising selective decrease in CRH-neurons provide novel targets for diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Judgments of agency are affected by sensory noise without recruiting metacognitive processing</a></h4>

              
                Acting in the world is accompanied by a sense of agency, or experience of control over our actions and their outcomes. As humans, we can report on this experience through judgments of agency. These judgments often occur under noisy conditions. We examined the computations underlying judgments of agency, in particular under the influence of sensory noise. Building on previous literature, we studied whether judgments of agency incorporate uncertainty in the same way that confidence judgments do, which would imply that the former share computational mechanisms with metacognitive judgments. In two tasks, participants rated agency, or confidence in a decision about their agency, over a virtual hand that tracked their movements, either synchronously or with a delay and either under high or low noise. We compared the predictions of two computational models to participants' ratings and found that agency ratings, unlike confidence, were best explained by a model involving no estimates of sensory noise. We propose that agency judgments reflect first-order measures of the internal signal, without involving metacognitive computations, challenging the assumed link between the two cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The imprinted Zdbf2 gene finely tunes control of feeding and growth in neonates</a></h4>

              
                Genomic imprinting refers to the mono-allelic and parent-specific expression of a subset of genes. While long recognized for their role in embryonic development, imprinted genes have recently emerged as important modulators of postnatal physiology, notably through hypothalamus-driven functions. Here, using mouse models of loss, gain and parental inversion of expression, we report that the paternally expressed <i>Zdbf2</i> gene controls neonatal growth in mice, in a dose-sensitive but parent-of-origin-independent manner. We further found that <i>Zdbf2</i>-KO neonates failed to fully activate hypothalamic circuits that stimulate appetite, and suffered milk deprivation and diminished circulating Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). Consequently, only half of <i>Zdbf2</i>-KO pups survived the first days after birth and those surviving were smaller. This study demonstrates that precise imprinted gene dosage is essential for vital physiological functions at the transition from intra- to extra-uterine life, here the adaptation to oral feeding and optimized body weight gain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Absolute quantitation of individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules provides a new paradigm for infection dynamics and variant differences</a></h4>

              
                Despite an unprecedented global research effort on SARS-CoV-2, early replication events remain poorly understood. Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency, while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, subgenomic RNAs, and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human interictal epileptiform discharges are bidirectional traveling waves echoing ictal discharges</a></h4>

              
                Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), also known as interictal spikes, are large intermittent electrophysiological events observed between seizures in patients with epilepsy. Though they occur far more often than seizures, IEDs are less studied, and their relationship to seizures remains unclear. To better understand this relationship, we examined multi-day recordings of microelectrode arrays implanted in human epilepsy patients, allowing us to precisely observe the spatiotemporal propagation of IEDs, spontaneous seizures, and how they relate. These recordings showed that the majority of IEDs are traveling waves, traversing the same path as ictal discharges during seizures, and with a fixed direction relative to seizure propagation. Moreover, the majority of IEDs, like ictal discharges, were bidirectional, with one predominant and a second, less frequent antipodal direction. These results reveal a fundamental spatiotemporal similarity between IEDs and ictal discharges. These results also imply that most IEDs arise in brain tissue outside the site of seizure onset and propagate toward it, indicating that the propagation of IEDs provides useful information for localizing the seizure focus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SNX9-induced membrane tubulation regulates CD28 cluster stability and signalling</a></h4>

              
                T cell activation requires engagement of a cognate antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) and the co-stimulatory signal of CD28. Both TCR and CD28 aggregate into clusters at the plasma membrane of activated T cells. While the role of TCR clustering in T cell activation has been extensively investigated, little is known about how CD28 clustering contributes to CD28 signalling. Here we report that upon CD28 triggering, the BAR-domain protein sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is recruited to CD28 clusters at the immunological synapse. Using three-dimensional correlative light and electron microscopy, we show that SNX9 generates membrane tubulation out of CD28 clusters. Our data further reveal that CD28 clusters are in fact dynamic structures and that SNX9 regulates their stability as well as CD28 phosphorylation and the resulting production of the cytokine IL-2. In summary, our work suggests a model in which SNX9-mediated tubulation generates a membrane environment that promotes CD28 triggering and downstream signalling events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic analysis of naturally occurring insertions and deletions that alter transcription factor spacing identifies tolerant and sensitive transcription factor pairs</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of gene expression requires the combinatorial binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) at promoters and enhancers. Prior studies showed that alterations in the spacing between TF binding sites can influence promoter and enhancer activity. However, the relative importance of TF spacing alterations resulting from naturally occurring insertions and deletions (InDels) has not been systematically analyzed. To address this question, we first characterized the genome-wide spacing relationships of 73 TFs in human K562 cells as determined by ChIP-seq. We found a dominant pattern of a relaxed range of spacing between collaborative factors, including 45 TFs exclusively exhibiting relaxed spacing with their binding partners. Next, we exploited millions of InDels provided by genetically diverse mouse strains and human individuals to investigate the effects of altered spacing on TF binding and local histone acetylation. These analyses suggested that spacing alterations resulting from naturally occurring InDels are generally tolerated in comparison to genetic variants directly affecting TF binding sites. To experimentally validate this prediction, we introduced synthetic spacing alterations between PU.1 and C/EBPβ binding sites at six endogenous genomic loci in a macrophage cell line. Remarkably, collaborative binding of PU.1 and C/EBPβ at these locations tolerated changes in spacing ranging from 5-bp increase to &gt;30-bp decrease. Collectively, these findings have implications for understanding mechanisms underlying enhancer selection and for the interpretation of non-coding genetic variation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An open-source tool for automated analysis of breathing behaviors in common marmosets and rodents</a></h4>

              
                The respiratory system maintains homeostatic levels of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the body through rapid and efficient regulation of breathing frequency and depth (tidal volume). The commonly used methods of analysing breathing data in behaving experimental animals are usually subjective, laborious, and time-consuming. To overcome these hurdles, we optimized an analysis toolkit for the unsupervised study of respiratory activities in animal subjects. Using this tool, we analyzed breathing behaviors of the common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), a New World non-human primate model. Using Whole-body Plethysmography in room air as well as acute hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypercapnic (6% CO<sub>2</sub>) conditions, we describe breathing behaviors in awake, freely behaving marmosets. Our data indicate that marmosets' exposure to acute hypoxia decreased metabolic rate and increased sigh rate. However, the hypoxic condition did not augment ventilation. Hypercapnia, on the other hand, increased both the frequency and depth (i.e., tidal volume) of breathing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global organization of neuronal activity only requires unstructured local connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Modern electrophysiological recordings simultaneously capture single-unit spiking activities of hundreds of neurons spread across large cortical distances. Yet, this parallel activity is often confined to relatively low-dimensional manifolds. This implies strong coordination also among neurons that are most likely not even connected. Here, we combine in vivo recordings with network models and theory to characterize the nature of mesoscopic coordination patterns in macaque motor cortex and to expose their origin: We find that heterogeneity in local connectivity supports network states with complex long-range cooperation between neurons that arises from multi-synaptic, short-range connections. Our theory explains the experimentally observed spatial organization of covariances in resting state recordings as well as the behaviorally related modulation of covariance patterns during a reach-to-grasp task. The ubiquity of heterogeneity in local cortical circuits suggests that the brain uses the described mechanism to flexibly adapt neuronal coordination to momentary demands.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synergistic phase separation of two pathways promotes integrin clustering and nascent adhesion formation</a></h4>

              
                Integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) are integrin-based plasma membrane-associated compartments where cells sense environmental cues. The physical mechanisms and molecular interactions that mediate initial IAC formation are unclear. We found that both p130Cas ('Cas') and Focal adhesion kinase ('FAK') undergo liquid-liquid phase separation <i>in vitro</i> under physiologic conditions. Cas- and FAK- driven phase separation is sufficient to reconstitute kindlin-dependent integrin clustering <i>in vitro </i>with recombinant mammalian proteins. <i>In vitro</i> condensates and IACs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit similar sensitivities to environmental perturbations including changes in temperature and pH. Furthermore, mutations that inhibit or enhance phase separation <i>in vitro</i> reduce or increase the number of IACs in MEFs, respectively. Finally, we find that the Cas and FAK pathways act synergistically to promote phase separation, integrin clustering, IAC formation and partitioning of key components <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. We propose that Cas- and FAK- driven phase separation provides an intracellular trigger for integrin clustering and nascent IAC formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Xbp1 and Brachyury establish an evolutionarily conserved subcircuit of the notochord gene regulatory network</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulatory networks coordinate the formation of organs and structures that compose the evolving body plans of different organisms. We are using a simple chordate model, the <i>Ciona</i> embryo, to investigate the essential gene regulatory network that orchestrates morphogenesis of the notochord, a structure necessary for the proper development of all chordate embryos. Although numerous transcription factors expressed in the notochord have been identified in different chordates, several of them remain to be positioned within a regulatory framework. Here we focus on Xbp1, a transcription factor expressed during notochord formation in <i>Ciona</i> and other chordates. Through the identification of Xbp1-downstream notochord genes in <i>Ciona</i>, we found evidence of the early co-option of genes involved in the unfolded protein response to the notochord developmental program. We report the regulatory interplay between Xbp1 and Brachyury, and by extending these results to <i>Xenopus</i>, we show that Brachyury and Xbp1 form a cross-regulatory subcircuit of the notochord gene regulatory network that has been consolidated during chordate evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An empirical energy landscape reveals mechanism of proteasome in polypeptide translocation</a></h4>

              
                The ring-like ATPase complexes in the AAA+ family perform diverse cellular functions that require coordination between the conformational transitions of their individual ATPase subunits<sup>1,2</sup>. How the energy from ATP hydrolysis is captured to perform mechanical work by these coordinated movements is unknown. In this study, we developed a novel approach for delineating the nucleotide-dependent free-energy landscape (FEL) of the proteasome's heterohexameric ATPase complex based on complementary structural and kinetic measurements. We used the FEL to simulate the dynamics of the proteasome and quantitatively evaluated the predicted structural and kinetic properties. The FEL model predictions are consistent with a wide range of experimental observations in this and previous studies and suggested novel mechanistic features of the proteasomal ATPases. We find that the cooperative movements of the ATPase subunits result from the design of the ATPase hexamer entailing a unique free-energy minimum for each nucleotide-binding status. ATP hydrolysis dictates the direction of substrate translocation by triggering an energy-dissipating conformational transition of the ATPase complex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automated annotation of birdsong with a neural network that segments spectrograms</a></h4>

              
                Songbirds provide a powerful model system for studying sensory-motor learning. However, many analyses of birdsong require time-consuming, manual annotation of its elements, called syllables. Automated methods for annotation have been proposed, but these methods assume that audio can be cleanly segmented into syllables, or they require carefully tuning multiple statistical models. Here we present TweetyNet: a single neural network model that learns how to segment spectrograms of birdsong into annotated syllables. We show that TweetyNet mitigates limitations of methods that rely on segmented audio. We also show that TweetyNet performs well across multiple individuals from two species of songbirds, Bengalese finches and canaries. Lastly, we demonstrate that using TweetyNet we can accurately annotate very large datasets containing multiple days of song, and that these predicted annotations replicate key findings from behavioral studies. In addition, we provide open-source software to assist other researchers, and a large dataset of annotated canary song that can serve as a benchmark. We conclude that TweetyNet makes it possible to address a wide range of new questions about birdsong.

                Injured neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system often die and seldom regenerate axons. To uncover transcriptional pathways that could ameliorate these disappointing responses we analyzed three interventions that increase survival and regeneration of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, albeit not to a clinically useful extent. We assessed gene expression in each of 46 RGC types by single cell transcriptomics following ONC and treatment. We also compared RGCs that regenerated to those that survived but did not regenerate. Each intervention enhanced survival of most RGC types, but type-independent axon regeneration required manipulation of multiple pathways. Distinct computational methods converged on separate sets of genes selectively expressed by RGCs likely to be dying, surviving, or regenerating. Overexpression of genes associated with the regeneration program enhanced axon regeneration in vivo, indicating that mechanistic analysis can be used to identify novel methods for promoting regeneration of injured neurons.

                This report is focusing on a function of the c-Fos protein in an associative, stress-induced memory. The shRNA vector injections were utilised to functionally silence the central amygdala nucleus in adult Wistar rats. Subsequently the operated animals and their control counterparts were screened in a selection of an emotionally-dependent tests and in a few standard behavioral neuroscience tools. Rats from the c-Fos silencing (ShFos) group expressed contra-depressive-like behaviors in Porsolt Swimming Test, spending more time actively searching for escape way then the rats from the control group. ShFos rats also had engaged in a more rapid activity in the Open Field Test, showing a decline in the neo-phobia. Micturition was decreased in shFos animals, indicating a change in the emotionality on an autonomic level. Presented results are showcasing a multi-directional regulation of the behaviors from the central amygdala nucleus by the c-Fos activity.

                Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic background. Recent genomic wide association studies have identified several loci linked to an increased risk of AD. However, genes regulated by these variants and the pathophysiological mechanisms regulated by those genes remain largely elusive. In this work, we studied the role of Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1), the second most important AD risk gene after APOE, in neurons generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in bi-dimensional cultures and cerebral organoids. We show that deletion of BIN1 is sufficient to cause neuronal hyperactivation and network desynchronization in a cell-autonomous fashion. These functional changes are correlated with increased Tau phosphorylation and transcriptional changes similar to those observed in the brains of AD patients, particularly in glutamatergic neurons. Together, our results reveal a role for BIN1 in the regulation of electrical activity in human neurons and suggest that its implication in AD pathogenesis could be related to the neuronal and network dysfunctions observed in the AD brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Denoising diffusion weighted imaging data using convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with multiple, high b-values is critical for extracting tissue microstructure measurements; however, high b-value DWI images contain high noise levels that can overwhelm the signal of interest and bias microstructural measurements. Here, we propose a simple denoising method that can be applied to any dataset, provided a low-noise, single-subject dataset is acquired using the same DWI sequence. The denoising method uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and deep learning to learn from a low-noise dataset, voxel-by-voxel. The trained model can then be applied to high-noise datasets from other subjects. We validated the 1D-CNN denoising method by first demonstrating that 1D-CNN denoising resulted in DWI images that were more similar to the noise-free ground truth than comparable denoising methods, e.g., MP-PCA, using simulated DWI data. Using the same DWI acquisition but reconstructed with two common reconstruction methods, i.e. SENSE1 and sum-of-square, to generate a pair of low-noise and high-noise datasets, we then demonstrated that 1D-CNN denoising of high-noise DWI data collected from human subjects showed promising results in three domains: DWI images, diffusion metrics, and tractography. In particular, the denoised images were very similar to a low-noise reference image of that subject, more than the similarity between repeated low-noise images (i.e. computational reproducibility). Finally, we demonstrated the use of the 1D-CNN method in two practical examples to reduce noise from parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice acquisition. We conclude that the 1D-CNN denoising method is a simple, effective denoising method for DWI images that overcomes some of the limitations of current state-of-the-art denoising methods, such as the need for a large number of subjects for training and accounting for the rectified noise floor.

                Color vision represents a vital aspect of perception that ultimately enables a wide variety of species to thrive in the natural world. However, unified methods for constructing chromatic visual stimuli in a laboratory setting are lacking. Here, we present stimulus design methods and an accompanying programming package to efficiently probe the color space of any species in which the photoreceptor spectral sensitivities are known. Our hardware-agnostic approach incorporates photoreceptor models within the framework of the principle of univariance. This enables experimenters to identify the most effective way to combine multiple light sources to create desired distributions of light, and thus easily construct relevant stimuli for mapping the color space of an organism. We include methodology to handle uncertainty of photoreceptor spectral sensitivity as well as to optimally reconstruct hyperspectral images given recent hardware advances. Our methods support broad applications in color vision science and provide a framework for uniform stimulus designs across experimental systems.

                Accurate decoding of neural signals often requires assigning extracellular waveforms acquired on the same electrode to their originating neurons, a process known as spike sorting. While many offline sorters are available, accurate online sorting of spikes with many channels is still a challenging problem. Existing online sorters either use simple algorithms with low accuracy, can only process a handful of channels, or depend on a complex runtime environment that is difficult to set up. We have developed a state-of-the-art online spike sorting platform in Python that enables large-scale, fully automatic real-time spike sorting and decoding on hundreds of channels. Our system is cross-platform and works seamlessly with the Open Ephys suite of open-source hardware and software widely used in many neuroscience laboratories worldwide. It also comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface to monitor the cluster quality, spike waveforms and neuronal firing rate. Our platform has comparable accuracy to offline sorters and can achieve an end-to-end sorting latency of around 160 ms for 128-channel signals. It will be useful for research in fundamental neuroscience, closed-loop feedback neuromodulation and brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory system-specific associations between brain structure and balance</a></h4>

              
                Nearly 75% of older adults in the United States report balance problems. Balance difficulties are more pronounced during sensory feedback perturbation (e.g., standing with the eyes closed or on foam). Although it is known that aging results in widespread brain atrophy, less is known about how brain structure relates to balance performance under varied sensory conditions in older age. We measured postural sway of 36 young (18-34 years) and 22 older (66-84 years) adults during four conditions: eyes open, eyes closed, eyes open on foam, and eyes closed on foam. We calculated three summary measures indicating visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular contributions to balance. We also collected T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted anatomical MRI scans. We aimed to: 1) test for age group differences in brain structure-balance relationships across a range of structural brain measures (i.e., volumetric, surface, and white matter microstructure); and 2) assess how brain structure measures relate to balance, regardless of age. Across both age groups, thinner cortex in multisensory integration regions was associated with greater reliance on visual inputs for balance. Greater gyrification within sensorimotor and parietal cortices was associated with greater reliance on proprioceptive inputs for balance. Poorer vestibular function was correlated with thinner vestibular cortex, greater gyrification within sensorimotor, parietal, and frontal cortices, and lower free water-corrected axial diffusivity in the superior-posterior corona radiata and across the corpus callosum. These results contribute to our scientific understanding of how individual differences in brain structure relate to balance. This has implications for developing brain stimulation interventions to improve balance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cross-domain functional organisation of posterior lateral temporal cortex: Insights from ALE meta-analyses of seven cognitive domains spanning 9515 participants</a></h4>

              
                The posterior lateral temporal cortex is implicated in many verbal, nonverbal and social cognitive domains and processes. Yet without directly comparing these disparate domains, the region's organisation remains unclear; do distinct processes engage discrete subregions, or could different domains engage shared neural correlates and processes? Here, using activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses, the bilateral posterior lateral temporal cortex subregions engaged in seven domains were directly compared. These domains comprised semantics, semantic control, phonology, biological motion, face processing, theory of mind, and representation of tools. Whilst phonology and biological motion were predominantly associated with distinct regions, other domains implicated overlapping areas, perhaps due to shared underlying processes. Theory of mind recruited regions implicated in semantic representation in the left hemisphere, tools engaged semantic control areas, and faces engaged subregions for biological motion and theory of mind. This cross-domain approach provides insight into how posterior lateral temporal cortex is organised and why.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Walking elicits global brain activity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Movement and behavioral state influence perception, and a stimulus can elicit opposite behavioral actions depending on whether the animal is moving toward or away from it. Here, we use fast wholebrain lightfield imaging in adult Drosophila melanogaster to analyze the relationship between movement and neuronal activity. Using pan-neuronal calcium imaging, we observe brainwide neuronal activity that tightly correlated with spontaneous bouts of movement. Imaging of specific sets of neurons across the brain reveals that both excitatory and inhibitory as well as different types of neuromodulatory neurons are active during walk inconsistent with a reduction of inhibition on neuronal activity. While most neuron types are activated at walk-onset, serotonergic neurons show more complex patterns of activity with neurons in several brain regions being inhibited during walk. Using available anatomical data, we map forward running and turning-induced activity onto different brain subregions and sometimes individual neurons. Moreover, we find that spontaneous walk and forced walk elicit highly similar wholebrain activity suggesting that a large part of the observed activity corresponds to walk itself rather than its initiation by higher brain centers. Based on our data, we conclude that movement and movement-related sensory feedback signals originating in the ventral nerve cord induce wide-spread activity in the brain allowing the integration of behavioral state into most or all brain processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ABLE: Automated Brain Lines Extraction Based on Laplacian Surface Collapse</a></h4>

              
                The archetypical folded shape of the human cortex has been a long-standing topic for neuroscientific research. Nevertheless, the accurate neuroanatomical segmentation of sulci remains a challenge. Part of the problem is the uncertainty of where a sulcus transitions into a gyrus and vice versa. This problem can be avoided by focusing on sulcal fundi and gyral crowns which represent the topological opposites of cortical folding. We present Automated Brain Lines Extraction (ABLE), a method based on Laplacian surface collapse to segment sulcal fundi and gyral crown lines reliably. ABLE is built to work on standard FreeSurfer outputs, and eludes the delineation of anastomotic sulci while maintaining sulcal fundi lines that traverse the regions with the highest depth and curvature. First, it segments the cortex into gyral and sulcal surfaces; then, each surface is spatially filtered. A Laplacian-collapse-based algorithm is then applied to obtain a thinned representation of the surfaces. This surface is then used for careful detection of the endpoints of the lines. Finally, sulcal fundi and gyral crown lines are obtained by eroding the surfaces while preserving the connectivity between the endpoints. The method is validated by comparing ABLE with three other sulcal extraction methods using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) test-retest database to assess the reproducibility of the different tools. The results confirm ABLE as a reliable method to obtain sulcal lines with an accurate representation of the sulcal topology while ignoring anastomotic branches and the overestimation of the sulcal fundi lines. ABLE is publicly available via https://github.com/HGGM-LIM/ABLE.

                Dopamine enables purposive behavior and adjusts vigor as a function of the relative value of actions. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine neurons die and give rise to a series of motor and cognitive changes that interfere with the expression of volitional actions. Here we report a novel inhibitory input to dopamine neurons originated in the mesencephalic locomotor region that selectively blocks purposive behavior. GABAergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) synapse onto dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and decrease dopamine release in the dorsal striatum. Activation of PPN neurons abolished exploratory locomotion and goal-directed actions while preserved other motor behaviors; furthermore, PPN caused a decrease in movement vigor and interrupted motor sequences presumably by modulating the immediate value of the learned action. Our results reveal an inhibitory mechanism in the midbrain that rapidly and reversibly adjusts the intrinsic value of ongoing actions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Specialization in somatostatin subnetworks in sensory and association cortex</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral states profoundly affect cortical population activity dynamics and coding, yet the local circuits mediating these shifts are poorly understood, especially outside of sensory cortex. Somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory interneurons are highly sensitive to changes in brain state, and are well situated to modulate local population activity patterns. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record the spike-related activity in populations of SOM and Non-SOM neurons in auditory cortex (AC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), to compare their functional interactions and activity modulation by behavioral state in sensory and association cortex. We have discovered both similarities and differences in the functional characteristics of SOM and Non-SOM populations across areas. In both regions, SOM neurons were more highly coordinated as populations than Non-SOM neurons. In PPC, SOM and Non-SOM neurons were positively modulated by increased arousal, while the effects of arousal in AC neurons were more diverse. Strikingly, the spatial structure of shared variability was different in AC and PPC: pairwise correlations in all cell types decayed rapidly with distance in AC but remained high over greater distances in PPC. Our results imply both generalization and specialization in the functional structure of excitatory and inhibitory subnetworks in sensory and association cortex.

                Regret describes recognizing that alternative actions could have led to better outcomes. This can transform into behavioral consequences, altering subsequent valuations, but remains unclear if regret derives from a generalized computation for mistake appraisal or instead is made up of dissociable action-specific processes. Using a novel neuroeconomic decision-making paradigm, we found mice were differentially sensitive to fundamentally distinct types of missed opportunities following exposure to chronic social defeat stress or manipulations of CREB, a key transcription factor implicated in chronic stress action. Bias to make compensatory decisions after rejecting high-value offers (regret type I) was unique to stress-susceptible mice. Bias following the converse operation, accepting low-value offers (regret type II), was enhanced in stress-resilient and absent in stress-susceptible mice. CREB function in either the medial prefrontal cortex or nucleus accumbens was required to suppress regret type I but differentially affected regret type II. We provide insight into how adaptive versus maladaptive stress-response traits may be related to fundamentally distinct forms of counterfactual thinking and could steer psychotherapy for mood disorders such as depression toward unveiling circuit-specific computations through a careful description of decision narrative.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Multisite and Multimodal Comparative Study of Cerebellar Connectome Between Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum has been increasingly recognized to play key roles in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and spectrum disorders (NMOSD), two main demyelinating diseases with similar clinical presentations. Despite accumulating evidence from neuroimaging research for cerebellar volumetric alterations in the diseases, however, there have been no network-based studies examining convergent and divergent alterations in cerebellar connectome between MS and NMOSD. This multisite and multimodal study examined common and specific alterations in within-cerebellar coordination and cerebello-cerebral communication between MS and NMOSD by retrospectively collecting structural and resting-state functional MRI data from 208 MS patients, 200 NMOSD patients and 228 healthy controls (HCs) in seven sites in China. Morphological brain networks were constructed by estimating interregional similarity in cortical thickness and functional brain networks were formed by calculating interregional temporal synchronization in functional signals. After identifying cerebellar modular architecture and based on prior cerebral cytoarchitectonic classification and functional partition, within-cerebellar and cerebello-cerebral morphological and functional connectivity were compared among the MS, NMOSD and HC groups. Five modules were identified within the cerebellum including Primary Motor A (PMA), Primary Motor B (PMB), Primary Non-Motor (PNM), Secondary Motor (SM) and Secondary Non-Motor (SNM) modules. Compared with the HCs, the MS and NMOSD patients exhibited both increases and decreases in within-cerebellar morphological connectivity that were mainly involved in the PMA, PMB and SNM. Particularly, the two patient groups showed a common altered pattern characterized by decreases between the PMA and SNM, both of which were more densely connected with the PMB. For cerebello-cerebral morphological connectivity, widespread reductions were found in both patient groups for the SM and SNM with almost all cerebral cytoarchitectonic classes and functional systems while increases were observed only in the NMOSD patients for the PMB with cerebral areas involving motor and sensory domains. With regard to cerebellar functional connectivity, fewer alterations were observed in the patients that were all characterized by reductions and were mainly involved in cerebello-cerebral interactions between cerebellar motor modules and cerebral association cortex and high-order networks, particularly in the NMOSD patients. Cerebellar connectivity-based classification achieved around 60% accuracies to distinguish the three groups to each other with morphological connectivity as predominant features for differentiating the patients from controls while functional connectivity for discriminating the two diseases. Altogether, this study characterizes common and specific circuit dysfunctions of the cerebellum between MS and NMOSD, which provide novel insights into shared and unique pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the two diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Membrane Stretch Gates NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                N-Methyl-D-aspartic (NMDA) receptors are excitatory glutamate-gated ion channels. Their activation is essential for the normal development, maintenance, and plasticity of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. They function as glutamate-gated Ca2+-permeable channels, require glycine as co-agonist, and can be modulated by myriad of diffusible ligands and cellular cues, including mechanical stimuli. Previously, we found that in cultured astrocytes, shear stress initiates NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry in the absence of added agonists, suggesting that in addition to being mechanosensitive, NMDA receptors may be mechanically activated. Here, we used controlled expression of recombinant receptors and non-invasive on-cell single-channel current recordings to show that gentle membrane stretch can substitute for the neurotransmitter glutamate in gating NMDA receptor currents. Notably, stretch-activated currents preserved the hallmark features of the glutamate-gated currents, including glycine-requirement, large unitary conductance, high Ca2+ permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg2+ blockade. Further, we found that the stretch-gated current required the receptor intracellular domain, which may suggest a force-from-filament sensing mechanism. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical forces can gate NMDA receptor currents even in the absence of synaptic glutamate release, which has important implications for understanding mechanotransduction and the effect of mechanical forces on cells of the central nervous system.

                Dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTADA) are critical for a variety of motivated behaviors. These cells receive synaptic inputs from over 100 anatomically-defined brain regions, which enables control from a distributed set of inputs across the brain. Extensive efforts have been made to map inputs to VTA cells based on neurochemical phenotype and output site. However, all of these studies have the same fundamental limitation that inputs local to the VTA cannot be properly assessed due to non-Cre-dependent uptake of EnvA-pseudotyped virus. Therefore, the quantitative contribution of local inputs to the VTA, including GABAergic, DAergic, and serotonergic, is not known. Here, we used a modified viral-genetic strategy that enables examination of both local as well as long-range inputs to VTADA cells. We found that nearly half of the total inputs to VTADA cells are located locally, revealing a substantial portion of inputs that have been missed by previous analyses. The majority of inhibition to VTADA cells arises from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, with large contributions from the VTA and the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to receiving inputs from VTAGABA neurons, DA neurons are connected with other DA neurons within the VTA as well as the nearby retrorubal field. Lastly, we show that VTADA neurons receive inputs from distributed serotonergic neurons throughout the midbrain and hindbrain, with the majority arising from the dorsal raphe. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate combination of viral-genetic reagents to unmask the complexity of connectivity relationships to defined cells in the brain.

                Cell-based therapies are a promising treatment paradigm for neurodegenerative diseases and other brain injuries. Despite recent advances in stem cell technology, major concerns have been raised regarding the feasibility and safety of cell therapies for clinical applications. Here, we generate good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transgene- and xeno-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be smoothly adapted for clinical applications. The produced NPCs have a stable gene-expression over at least 15 passages and can be scaled for up to 1018 cells per initially seeded 106 cells. To ensure a pure NPC population for in vivo applications, we reduce risks of iPSC contamination using micro RNA-switch technology as a safety checkpoint. Using lentiviral transduction with a fluorescent and bioluminescent dual-reporter construct, combined with non-invasive in vivo bioluminescent imaging, we longitudinally tracked the grafted cells in healthy wild-type and genetically immunosuppressed mice as well as in a mouse model of ischemic stroke. Long term in-depth characterization revealed that transplanted cells have the capability to survive and spontaneously differentiate into functional and mature neurons throughout a time course of a month.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by heterogeneous motor and non-motor symptoms. The majority of PD cases are sporadic, whereas the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutation is the most common monogenic cause of familial PD and symptomatically indistinguishable from the sporadic form. Deficits in protein synthesis have been reported in PD. However, it is not known which proteins are affected or if there are synthesis differences between patients with sporadic and LRRK2 G2019S PD. Here we used non-canonical amino acid labeling and mass-spectrometry based proteomics to perform a quantitative comparison of nascent proteins in fibroblasts from sporadic and G2019S mutation PD patients compared to healthy individuals. We found that several proteins were under-represented among nascent proteins in cells from PD patients. Among these were regulators endo-lysosomal sorting, mRNA processing and translation itself. We further validated which of these proteins were dysregulated at the static proteome level using targeted proteomics. Key downregulated proteins included the autophagy regulator ATG9A and translational stability regulator YTHDF3. Notably, 68% of the identified proteins were downregulated in both sporadic and LRRK2-G2019S forms of PD. We identify translational repression of key regulators of proteostasis in patient fibroblasts that are common to both sporadic and LRRK2-G2019S PD.

                Histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) regulate gene expression via changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor recruitment. At a given locus, the coordinated enrichment of several distinct hPTMs regulate gene expression in response to external stimuli. However, neuronal hPTMs have been primarily characterized in bulk brain tissue and/or tissue pooled across subjects. This obscures both cell-type and individual variability, features essential to understand individual susceptibility to psychiatric disease. To address this limitation, we optimized a hybrid protocol, ICuRuS, to profile both activating and repressive hPTMs in neuronal subtypes from a single mouse. We report here profiling of striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, genetically defined by expression of Adenosine 2a Receptor (A2a) or Dopamine Receptor D1 (D1), which differentially regulate reward processing and pathophysiology. Using ICuRuS, we defined genome-wide, A2a- or D1-specific combinatorial hPTM profiles, and discovered regulatory epigenomic features at genes implicated in neurobiological function and disease.

                Building precise and detailed parcellations of anatomically and functionally distinct brain areas has been a major focus in Neuroscience. Pioneer anatomists parcellated the cortical manifold based on extensive histological studies of post-mortem brain, harnessing local variations in cortical cyto- and myeloarchitecture to define areal boundaries. Compared to the cytoarchitectonic field, where multiple neuroimaging studies have recently translated this old legacy data into useful analytical resources, myeloarchitectonics, which parcellate the cortex based on the organization of myelinated fibers, has received less attention. Here, we present the neocortical surface-based myeloarchitectonic atlas based on the histology-derived maps of the Vogt-Vogt school and its 2D translation by Nieuwenhuys. In addition to a myeloarchitectonic parcellation, our package includes intracortical laminar profiles of myelin content based on Vogt-Vogt-Hopf original publications. Histology-derived myelin density mapped on our atlas demonstrate close overlap with in vivo quantitative MRI markers for myelin and relates to cytoarchitectural features. Complementing the existing battery of approaches for digital cartography, the whole-brain myeloarchitectonic atlas offers an opportunity to validate imaging surrogate markers of myelin in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Isolating perceptual biases caused by trial history during auditory categorization</a></h4>

              
                Just as most experiences have their origin in our perceptions, our perceptions can also be fundamentally shaped by our experiences. However, isolating which events in the recent past can impact perceptual judgments remains a difficult question, partly because post-perceptual processes can also introduce strong history dependencies. Two mechanisms have been hypothesized to specifically modulate perception: 1) the repulsive influence caused by previous stimuli and generally labeled as aftereffects, and 2) the modulation caused by stimulus predictions based on learned temporal regularities of the sensory environment, a key assumption in the predictive coding framework. Here, we ask whether these two mechanisms do indeed bias perception by training rats in an auditory task featuring serial correlations along the sequence of stimuli. We develop a detailed behavioral model that isolates the repulsive aftereffect generated by previous stimuli and shows that this repulsion cannot be explained from an interaction between past and current stimuli, and that it is still present in catch trials lacking the current stimulus. Moreover, the model describes that the bias caused by the animals' expectation, as they leverage the predictability of the stimulus sequence, is present in a foraging task without the sensory component but with the same serial correlations in the sequence of rewards. These results indicate that the aftereffect and the prediction biases observed during an auditory task can all be revealed in the absence of a sensory stimulus, putting into question their perceptual nature.

                Background: A growing body of evidence supports the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction might represent a key feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Central regulators of energy production, mitochondria are also involved in several other essential functions such as cell death pathways and neuroinflammation which make them a potential therapeutic target for PD management. Interestingly, recent studies related to PD have reported a neuroprotective effect of targeting mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) by the insulin sensitizer MSDC-0160. As the sole point of entry of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix, MPC plays a crucial role in energetic metabolism which is impacted in PD. This study therefore aimed at providing insights into the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of MSDC-0160. Methods: We investigated behavioral, cellular and metabolic impact of chronic MSDC-0160 treatment in unilateral 6-OHDA PD rats. We evaluated mitochondrial related processes through the expression of pivotal mitochondrial enzymes in dorsal striatal biopsies and the level of metabolites in serum samples using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics. Results: MSDC-0160 treatment in unilateral 6-OHDA rats improved motor behavior, decreased dopaminergic denervation and reduced mTOR activity and neuroinflammation. Concomitantly, MSDC-0160 administration strongly modified energy metabolism as revealed by increased ketogenesis, beta oxidation and glutamate oxidation to satisfy energy needs and maintain energy homeostasis. Conclusion: MSDC-0160 exerts its neuroprotective effect through reorganization of multiple pathways connected to energy metabolism. Keywords: Parkinson's disease, Neuroprotection, Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, Energy metabolism

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Region Selective Cortical Control Of The Thalamic Reticular Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Corticothalamic pathways, responsible for the top-down control of the thalamus display a classical, canonical organization in that every cortical region sends dual, layer 6 (L6) and layer 5 (L5) output to the thalamus. Here we demonstrate a qualitative, region-specific difference in the organization of corticothalamic pathways. We show that L5 pyramidal cells of the frontal, but not other cortical regions establish monosynaptic connection with the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The frontal L5-TRN pathway paralleled the L6-TRN projection but displayed distinct morphological and physiological features. The exact spike output of the L5 contacted TRN cells correlated with the level of cortical synchrony. Optogenetic perturbation of the L5-TRN connection disrupted the tight link between cortical and TRN activity. L5-driven TRN cells innervated all thalamic nuclei involved in the control of frontal cortical activity. Our data show that frontal cortical functions require a highly specialized cortical control over intrathalamic inhibitory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust, long-term video EEG monitoring in a porcine model of post-traumatic epilepsy.</a></h4>

              
                To date, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) research in large animal models has been limited. Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 14 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal to noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metastability, fractal scaling, and synergistic information processing: what phase relationships reveal about intrinsic brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in resting-state fMRI holds promise to deliver candidate biomarkers for clinical applications. However, the reliability and interpretability of dFC metrics remain contested. Despite a myriad of methodologies and resulting measures, few studies have combined metrics derived from different conceptualizations of brain functioning within the same analysis - perhaps missing an opportunity for improved interpretability. Using a complexity-science approach, we assessed the reliability and interrelationships of a battery of phase-based dFC metrics including tools originated from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and information dynamics approaches. Our analysis revealed novel relationships between these metrics, which allowed us to build a predictive model for integrated information using metrics from dynamical systems and information theory. Furthermore, global metastability - a metric reflecting simultaneous tendencies for coupling and decoupling - was found to be the most representative and stable metric in brain parcellations that included cerebellar regions. Additionally, spatiotemporal patterns of phase-locking were found to change in a slow, non-random, continuous manner over time. Taken together, our findings show that the majority of characteristics of resting-state fMRI dynamics reflect an interrelated dynamical- and informational-complexity profile, which is unique to each acquisition. This finding challenges the interpretation of results from cross-sectional designs for brain neuromarker discovery, suggesting that individual life-trajectories may be more informative than sample means.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural insights into the galanin receptors signaling</a></h4>

              
                Galanin is a biologically active neuropeptide, and functions through three distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely GALR1, GALR2 and GLAR3. GALR signaling plays important roles in regulating various physiological processes such as energy metabolism, neuropathic pain, epileptic activity, and sleep homeostasis. GALR1 and GALR3 signal through the Gi/o pathway, whereas GALR2 signals mainly through the Gq/11 pathway. However, the molecular basis for galanin recognition and G protein selectivity of GALRs remains poorly understood. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy structures of the GALR1-Go and the GALR2-Gq complexes bound to the endogenous ligand galanin or spexin. The galanin peptide mainly adopts an alpha helical structure, which binds at the extracellular vestibule of the receptors, nearly parallel to the membrane plane without penetrating deeply into the receptor core. Structural analysis combined with functional studies reveals important structural determinants for the G protein selectivity of GALRs as well as other class A GPCRs. In addition, we show that the zinc ion is a negative allosteric regulator of GALR1 but not GALR2. Our studies provide insight into the mechanisms of G protein selectivity of GPCRs and highlight potential novel function of the neuromodulator zinc ion as a modulator of GPCR signaling in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural changes after early life adversity in rodents: a systematic review with meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Early life adversity (ELA) is a well-documented risk factor for psychiatric illnesses in humans. This risk may, in part, be conferred by structural changes induced by ELA, lasting into adulthood. We here review the evidence for such lasting structural changes in rodent models for ELA involving altered maternal care during the first two postnatal weeks. In total, we extracted data from 64 studies reporting on 260 comparisons in adult rats or mice which experienced ELA or control treatment. Most of the observations concerned structural changes in the hippocampus of adult male rats earlier exposed to maternal separation. A 3-level meta-analysis revealed that ELA reduced hippocampal volume and the number of dendritic branches as well as dendritic length of principal hippocampal cells. No differences were observed across the hippocampal subfields. In terms of adult neurogenesis in the dentate subgranular zone, both staining for BrdU and the early neuronal marker DCX were significantly reduced, while the general proliferation marker Ki67 remained unchanged. The neuronal growth factor BDNF did not show significant changes, although the unexplained heterogeneity was moderate. Generally, the effect of ELA compared to control on structural markers was not affected by additional stressors experienced in life. Overall, the data available support the notion that ELA, at least in the hippocampus of male rats, lastingly reduces volume, hampers dendritic growth and suppresses adult neurogenesis.

                COVID-19 has prominent neurological manifestations including psychiatric symptoms, indicating significant synaptic pathology. Surprisingly, existing evidence suggests negligible expression of the key SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry mediators ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human brain, which complicates understanding of the pathomechanisms of the neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID-19. Recent studies suggested that an alternative host-cell entry receptor, NRP1, can mediate entry of furin cleaved SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins into the host cells. However, the role of NRP1 and furin in mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry in human brain cells has been least explored and remains a lacuna in the literature. We performed an in silico analysis of the transcriptomic and proteomic expressions of SARS-CoV-2 host-cell entry receptors and associated tissue proteases in human brain tissue, using the publically available databases. Based on the expression analysis, SARS-CoV-2 entry in human brain cells is likely to be mediated through NRP1 and furin.

                The Stroop effect is a well-known behavioral phenomenon in humans that refers to robust interference between language and color information. Although this effect has long been studied, it remains unclear when the interference occurs and how it is resolved in the brain. By manipulating the verbality of stimulus perception and response generation, here we show that the Stroop effect occurs during perception of color-word stimuli and is resolved by a cross-hemispheric, excitatory-inhibitory functional loop involving the lateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Humans performed a Stroop task and a control task in which the stimulus did not contain verbal information, and made a response either vocally or manually. The resolution of Stroop interference involved the lateral prefrontal cortex in the left hemisphere and the cerebellum in the right hemisphere, independently of whether the response was made vocally or manually. In contrast, such cross-hemispheric lateralization was absent during the non-verbal control task. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex amplified cerebellar activity, whereas the cerebellum suppressed prefrontal activity, and these effects were enhanced during interference resolution. These results suggest that this fronto-cerebellar loop involving language and cognitive systems regulates goal-relevant information to resolve the interference occurring during simultaneous perception of a word and color.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing sounds: Neural mechanisms underlying auditory contributions to visual detection</a></h4>

              
                Sounds enhance the detection of visual stimuli while concurrently biasing observers decisions. To investigate the neural mechanisms that underly such multisensory interactions, we decoded time-resolved signal detection theory (SDT) sensitivity and criterion parameters from magnetoencephalography activity while participants performed a visual detection task. Using temporal generalization analysis, we found that sounds improve visual detection by enhancing the maintenance of the most informative perceptual samples over time. In parallel, criterion decoding analyses revealed that sounds evoke patterns of activity that resembled the patterns evoked by an actual visual stimulus. These two complementary mechanisms of audiovisual interaction differed in terms of their automaticity: Whereas the sound-induced enhancement in visual information maintenance depended on participants being actively engaged in a detection task, sounds evoked visual activity patterns in the visual cortex in a bottom-up fashion, challenging the classical assumption that sound-induced reductions in criterion correspond to decision-level biases.

	<p>For more than two decades, research focusing on both clinical and non-clinical populations has suggested a key role for specific regions in the regulation of self-conscious emotions. It is speculated that both the expression and the interpretation of self-conscious emotions are critical in humans for action planning and response, communication, learning, parenting, and most social encounters. Empathy, Guilt, Jealousy, Shame, and Pride are all categorized as self-conscious emotions, all of which are crucial components to one&amp;amp;rsquo;s sense of self. There has been an abundance of evidence pointing to the right Fronto-Temporal involvement in the integration of cognitive processes underlying the expression of these emotions. Numerous regions within the right hemisphere have been identified including the right temporal parietal junction (rTPJ), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). In this review, we aim to investigate patient cases, in addition to clinical and non-clinical studies. We also aim to highlight these specific brain regions pivotal to the right hemispheric dominance observed in the neural correlates of such self-conscious emotions and provide the potential role that self-conscious emotions play in evolution.</p>

	<p>Sensory processing differences are an established feature of both syndromic and non-syndromic Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Significant work has been carried out to characterize and classify specific sensory profiles in non-syndromic autism. However, it is not known if syndromic autism disorders, such as Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMD) or SYNGAP1-related Intellectual Disability (SYNGAP1-ID), have unique sensory phenotypes. Understanding the sensory features of these disorders is important for providing appropriate care and for understanding their underlying mechanisms. Our objective in this work was to determine the sensory processing abnormalities present in two syndromic ASDs: Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and SYNGAP1-related Intellectual Disability. Using a standardized instrument, the Short Sensory Profile-2, we characterized sensory features in 41 patients with PMD and 24 patients with SYNGAP1-ID, and sub-scores were then calculated for seeking, avoiding, sensitivity and registration, as well as overall sensory and behavior scores. We found both patient groups exhibited atypical sensory features, including high scores in the areas of avoiding and seeking. Thus, we discovered significant sensory processing abnormalities are common in these syndromic ASDs. Measurements of sensory processing could serve as useful clinical endpoints for trials of novel therapeutics for these populations.</p>

	<p>Due to phoenixin&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in restraint stress and glucocorticoid stress, as well as its recently shown effects on the inflammasome, we aimed to investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory stress on the activity of brain nuclei-expressing phoenixin. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6/group) were intraperitoneally injected with either LPS or control (saline). Brains were processed for c-Fos and phoenixin immunohistochemistry and the resulting slides were evaluated using ImageJ software. c-Fos was counted and phoenixin was evaluated using densitometry. LPS stress significantly increased c-Fos expression in the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeM, 7.2-fold), supraoptic nucleus (SON, 34.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.3 vs. 0.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.0), arcuate nucleus (Arc, 4.9-fold), raphe pallidus (RPa, 5.1-fold), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSt, 5.9-fold), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMN, 89-fold), and medial part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (mNTS, 121-fold) compared to the control-injected group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Phoenixin expression also significantly increased in the CeM (1.2-fold), SON (1.5-fold), RPa (1.3-fold), DMN (1.3-fold), and mNTS (1.9-fold, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), leading to a positive correlation between c-Fos and phoenixin in the RPa, BSt, and mNTS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, LPS stress induces a significant increase in activity in phoenixin immunoreactive brain nuclei that is distinctively different from restraint stress.</p>

	<p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is a vertebrate-specific nucleus and the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. This nucleus has conserved properties across species: highly homogeneous cell types, a small number of cells but extensive axonal projections, and potent influence on brain states. Comparative studies on LC benefit greatly from its homogeneity in cell types and modularity in projection patterns, and thoroughly understanding the LC-NE system could shed new light on the organization principles of other more complex modulatory systems. Although studies on LC are mainly focused on mammals, many of the fundamental properties and functions of LC are readily observable in other vertebrate models and could inform mammalian studies. Here, we summarize anatomical and functional studies of LC in non-mammalian vertebrate classes, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, on topics including axonal projections, gene expressions, homeostatic control, and modulation of sensorimotor transformation. Thus, this review complements mammalian studies on the role of LC in the brain.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The human amygdala and hippocampus are critically involved in various processes in face perception. However, it remains unclear how task demands or evaluative contexts modulate processes underlying face perception. In this study, we employed two task instructions when participants viewed the same faces and recorded single-neuron activity from the human amygdala and hippocampus. We comprehensively analyzed task modulation for three key aspects of face processing and we found that neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus (1) encoded high-level social traits such as perceived facial trustworthiness and dominance and this response was modulated by task instructions; (2) encoded low-level facial features and demonstrated region-based feature coding, which was not modulated by task instructions; and (3) encoded fixations on salient face parts such as the eyes and mouth, which was not modulated by task instructions. Together, our results provide a comprehensive survey of task modulation of neural processes underlying face perception at the single-neuron level in the human amygdala and hippocampus.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In <I>Drosophila</I>, molecular pathways affecting longevity have been extensively studied. However, corresponding neurophysiological changes underlying aging-related functional and behavioral deteriorations remain to be fully explored. We examined different motor circuits in <I>Drosophila</I> across the life span and uncovered distinctive age-resilient and age-vulnerable trajectories in their established functional properties. In the giant fiber (GF) and downstream circuit elements responsible for the jump-and-flight escape reflex, we observed relatively mild deterioration toward the end of the life span. In contrast, more substantial age-dependent modifications were seen in the plasticity of GF afferent processing, specifically in use dependence and habituation properties. In addition, there were profound changes in different afferent circuits that drive flight motoneuron activities, including flight pattern generation and seizure spike discharges evoked by electroconvulsive stimulation. Importantly, in high-temperature (HT)-reared flies (29&deg;C), the general trends in these age-dependent trajectories were largely maintained, albeit over a compressed time scale, lending support for the common practice of HT rearing for expediting <I>Drosophila</I> aging studies. We discovered that shortened life spans in <I>Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase</I> (<I>Sod</I>) mutant flies were accompanied by altered aging trajectories in motor circuit properties distinct from those in HT-reared flies, highlighting differential effects of oxidative versus temperature stressors. This work helps to identify several age-vulnerable neurophysiological parameters that may serve as quantitative indicators for assessing genetic and environmental influences on aging progression in <I>Drosophila</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">D1/D5 Dopamine Receptors and mGluR5 Jointly Enable Non-Hebbian Long-Term Potentiation at Sensory Synapses onto Lamina I Spinoparabrachial Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Highly correlated firing of primary afferent inputs and lamina I projection neurons evokes synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism by which ascending nociceptive transmission can be amplified at the level of the spinal dorsal horn. However, the degree to which neuromodulatory signaling shapes the temporal window governing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at sensory synapses onto projection neurons remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that activation of spinal D1/D5 dopamine receptors (D1/D5Rs) creates a highly permissive environment for the production of LTP in male and female adult mouse spinoparabrachial neurons by promoting non-Hebbian plasticity. Bath application of the mixed D1/D5R agonist SKF82958 unmasked LTP at STDP pairing intervals that normally fail to alter synaptic efficacy. Furthermore, during D1/D5R signaling, action potential discharge in projection neurons became dispensable for LTP generation, and primary afferent stimulation alone was sufficient to induce strengthening of sensory synapses. This non-Hebbian LTP was blocked by the D1/D5R antagonist SCH 39166 or genetic deletion of D5R, and required activation of mGluR5 and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but was independent of NMDAR activation. D1/D5R-enabled non-Hebbian plasticity was observed across multiple neuronal subpopulations in the superficial dorsal horn but was more prevalent in spinoparabrachial neurons than interneurons. Interestingly, the ability of neonatal tissue damage to promote non-Hebbian LTP in adult projection neurons was not observed in D5R knock-out mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that joint spinal D1/D5R and mGluR5 activation can allow unfettered potentiation of sensory synapses onto the output neurons responsible for conveying pain and itch information to the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic LTP in spinal projection neurons has been implicated in the generation of chronic pain. Under normal conditions, plasticity at sensory synapses onto adult mouse spinoparabrachial neurons follows strict Hebbian learning rules, requiring coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic firing. Here, we demonstrate that the activation of spinal D1/D5Rs promotes a switch from Hebbian to non-Hebbian LTP so that primary afferent stimulation alone is sufficient to evoke LTP in the absence of action potential discharge in projection neurons, which required joint activation of mGluR5 and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but not NMDARs. These results suggest that D1/D5Rs cooperate with mGluR5 receptors in the spinal dorsal horn to powerfully influence the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission to the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Embryonic Pericytes Promote Microglial Homeostasis and Their Effects on Neural Progenitors in the Developing Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multifaceted microglial functions in the developing brain, such as promoting the differentiation of neural progenitors and contributing to the positioning and survival of neurons, have been progressively revealed. Although previous studies have noted the relationship between vascular endothelial cells and microglia in the developing brain, little attention has been given to the importance of pericytes, the mural cells surrounding endothelial cells. In this study, we attempted to dissect the role of pericytes in microglial distribution and function in developing mouse brains. Our immunohistochemical analysis showed that approximately half of the microglia attached to capillaries in the cerebral walls. Notably, a magnified observation of the position of microglia, vascular endothelial cells and pericytes demonstrated that microglia were preferentially associated with pericytes that covered 79.8% of the total capillary surface area. Through <I>in vivo</I> pericyte depletion induced by the intraventricular administration of a neutralizing antibody against platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)&beta; (clone APB5), we found that microglial density was markedly decreased compared with that in control antibody-treated brains because of their low proliferative capacity. Moreover, <I>in vitro</I> coculture of isolated CD11b<sup>+</sup> microglia and NG2<sup>+</sup>PDGFR&alpha;<sup>&ndash;</sup> cells, which are mostly composed of pericytes, from parenchymal cells indicated that pericytes promote microglial proliferation via the production of soluble factors. Furthermore, pericyte depletion by APB5 treatment resulted in a failure of microglia to promote the differentiation of neural stem cells into intermediate progenitors. Taken together, our findings suggest that pericytes facilitate microglial homeostasis in the developing brains, thereby indirectly supporting microglial effects on neural progenitors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study highlights the novel effect of pericytes on microglia in the developing mouse brain. Through multiple analyses using an <I>in vivo</I> pericyte depletion mouse model and an <I>in vitro</I> coculture study of isolated pericytes and microglia from parenchymal cells, we demonstrated that pericytes contribute to microglial proliferation and support microglia in efficiently promoting the differentiation of neural stem cells into intermediate progenitors. Our present data provide evidence that pericytes function not only in the maintenance of cerebral microcirculation and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity but also in microglial homeostasis in the developing cerebral walls. These findings will expand our knowledge and help elucidate the mechanism of brain development both in healthy and disease conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Existence of Functional Connectome Fingerprint during Infancy and Its Stability over Months</a></h4>

              
                <p>The functional connectome fingerprint is a cluster of individualized brain functional connectivity patterns that are capable of distinguishing one individual from others. Although its existence has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults, whether such individualized patterns exist during infancy is barely investigated despite its importance in identifying the origin of the intrinsic connectome patterns that potentially mirror distinct behavioral phenotypes. To fill this knowledge gap, capitalizing on a longitudinal high-resolution structural and resting-state functional MRI dataset with 104 human infants (53 females) with 806 longitudinal scans (age, 16&ndash;876 d) and infant-specific functional parcellation maps, we observe that the brain functional connectome fingerprint may exist since infancy and keeps stable over months during early brain development. Specifically, we achieve an ~78% individual identification rate by using ~5% selected functional connections, compared with the best identification rate of 60% without connection selection. The frontoparietal networks recognized as the most contributive networks in adult functional connectome fingerprinting retain their superiority in infants despite being widely acknowledged as rapidly developing systems during childhood. The existence and stability of the functional connectome fingerprint are further validated on adjacent age groups. Moreover, we show that the infant frontoparietal networks can reach similar accuracy in predicting individual early learning composite scores as the whole-brain connectome, again resembling the observations in adults and highlighting the relevance of functional connectome fingerprint to cognitive performance. For the first time, these results suggest that each individual may retain a unique and stable marker of functional connectome during early brain development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional connectome fingerprinting during infancy featuring rapid brain development remains almost uninvestigated even though it is essential for understanding the early individual-level intrinsic pattern of functional organization and its relationship with distinct behavioral phenotypes. With an infant-tailored functional connection selection and validation strategy, we strive to provide the delineation of the infant functional connectome fingerprint by examining its existence, stability, and relationship with early cognitive performance. We observe that the brain functional connectome fingerprint may exist since early infancy and remains stable over months during the first 2 years. The identified key contributive functional connections and networks for fingerprinting are also verified to be highly predictive for cognitive score prediction, which reveals the association between infant connectome fingerprint and cognitive performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuregulin 1 and ErbB4 Kinase Actively Regulate Sharp Wave Ripples in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sharp wave ripples (SW-Rs) in the hippocampus are synchronized bursts of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (PyNs), critical for spatial working memory. However, the molecular underpinnings of SW-Rs remain poorly understood. We show that SW-Rs in hippocampal slices from both male and female mice were suppressed by neuregulin 1 (NRG1), an epidermal growth factor whose expression is enhanced by neuronal activity. Pharmacological inhibition of ErbB4, a receptor tyrosine kinase for NRG1, increases SW-R occurrence rate in hippocampal slices. These results suggest an important role of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in regulating SW-Rs. To further test this notion, we characterized SW-Rs in freely moving male mice, chemical genetic mutant mice, where ErbB4 can be specifically inhibited by the bulky inhibitor 1NMPP1. Remarkably, SW-R occurrence was increased by 1NMPP1. We found that 1NMPP1 increased the firing rate of PyN neurons, yet disrupted PyN neuron dynamics during SW-R events. Furthermore, 1NMPP1 increased SW-R occurrence during both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep states and wake states with a greater impact on SW-Rs during wake states. In accord, spatial working memory was attenuated in male mice. Together these results indicate that dynamic activity of ErbB4 kinase is critical to SW-Rs and spatial working memory. This study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of SW-Rs and a novel function of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sharp wave ripples (SW-Rs) are a hippocampal event, important for memory functioning. Yet the molecular pathways that regulate SW-Rs remain unclear. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), previously known to be increased in pyramidal neuron's (PyNs) in an activity dependent manner, signals to its receptor, ErbB4 kinase, that is in important regulator of GABAergic transmission and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that SW-Rs are regulated by this signaling pathway in a dynamic manner. Not only so, we show that this signaling pathway is dynamically needed for spatial working memory. These data suggest a molecular signaling pathway, NRG1-ErbB4, that regulates an important network event of the hippocampus, SW-Rs, that underlies memory functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroendocrine Stress Axis-Dependence of Duloxetine Analgesia (Anti-Hyperalgesia) in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). While it is only effective in little more than half of patients, our ability to predict patient response remains incompletely understood. Given that stress exacerbates CIPN, and that the therapeutic effect of duloxetine is thought to be mediated, at least in part, via its effects on adrenergic mechanisms, we evaluated the contribution of neuroendocrine stress axes, sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, to the effect of duloxetine in preclinical models of oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced CIPN. Systemic administration of duloxetine, which alone had no effect on nociceptive threshold, both prevented and reversed mechanical hyperalgesia associated with oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-CIPN. It more robustly attenuated oxaliplatin CIPN in male rats, while it was more effective for paclitaxel CIPN in females. Gonadectomy attenuated these sex differences in the effect of duloxetine. To assess the role of neuroendocrine stress axes in the effect of duloxetine on CIPN, rats of both sexes were submitted to adrenalectomy combined with fixed level replacement of corticosterone and epinephrine. While CIPN, in these rats, was of similar magnitude to that observed in adrenal-intact animals, rats of neither sex responded to duloxetine. Furthermore, duloxetine blunted an increase in corticosterone induced by oxaliplatin, and prevented the exacerbation of CIPN by sound stress. Our results demonstrate a role of neuroendocrine stress axes in duloxetine analgesia (anti-hyperalgesia) for the treatment of CIPN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating dose-dependent and therapy-limiting side effect of many of the cytostatic drugs used to treat cancer (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Argyriou et al., 2010</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B44">Marmiroli et al., 2017</cross-ref>). Duloxetine is the only treatment for CIPN currently recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B26">Hershman et al., 2014</cross-ref>). In the present study, focused on elucidating mechanisms mediating the response of oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy to duloxetine, we demonstrate a major contribution to its effect of neuroendocrine stress axis function. These findings, which parallel the clinical observation that stress may impact response of CIPN to duloxetine (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B76">Taylor et al., 2007</cross-ref>), open new approaches to the treatment of CIPN and other stress-associated pain syndromes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Representations of Tonotopy and Pitch in Human Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frequency-to-place mapping, or tonotopy, is a fundamental organizing principle throughout the auditory system, from the earliest stages of auditory processing in the cochlea to subcortical and cortical regions. Although cortical maps are referred to as tonotopic, it is unclear whether they simply reflect a mapping of physical frequency inherited from the cochlea, a computation of pitch based on the fundamental frequency, or a mixture of these two features. We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure BOLD responses as male and female human participants listened to pure tones that varied in frequency or complex tones that varied in either spectral content (brightness) or fundamental frequency (pitch). Our results reveal evidence for pitch tuning in bilateral regions that partially overlap with the traditional tonotopic maps of spectral content. In general, primary regions within Heschl's gyri (HGs) exhibited more tuning to spectral content, whereas areas surrounding HGs exhibited more tuning to pitch.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tonotopy, an orderly mapping of frequency, is observed throughout the auditory system. However, it is not known whether the tonotopy observed in the cortex simply reflects the frequency spectrum (as in the ear) or instead represents the higher-level feature of fundamental frequency, or pitch. Using carefully controlled stimuli and high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we separated these features to study their cortical representations. Our results suggest that tonotopy in primary cortical regions is driven predominantly by frequency, but also reveal evidence for tuning to pitch in regions that partially overlap with the tonotopic gradients but extend into nonprimary cortical areas. In addition to resolving ambiguities surrounding cortical tonotopy, our findings provide evidence that selectivity for pitch is distributed bilaterally throughout auditory cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Increased Connectivity among Sensory and Motor Regions during Visual and Audiovisual Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday conversation, we usually process the talker's face as well as the sound of the talker's voice. Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is degraded. Here, we used fMRI to monitor brain activity while adult humans (<I>n</I> = 60) were presented with visual-only, auditory-only, and audiovisual words. The audiovisual words were presented in quiet and in several signal-to-noise ratios. As expected, audiovisual speech perception recruited both auditory and visual cortex, with some evidence for increased recruitment of premotor cortex in some conditions (including in substantial background noise). We then investigated neural connectivity using psychophysiological interaction analysis with seed regions in both primary auditory cortex and primary visual cortex. Connectivity between auditory and visual cortices was stronger in audiovisual conditions than in unimodal conditions, including a wide network of regions in posterior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we also conducted a region-of-interest analysis on the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), implicated in many previous studies of audiovisual speech perception. We found evidence for both activity and effective connectivity in pSTS for visual-only and audiovisual speech, although these were not significant in whole-brain analyses. Together, our results suggest a prominent role for cross-region synchronization in understanding both visual-only and audiovisual speech that complements activity in integrative brain regions like pSTS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In everyday conversation, we usually process the talker's face as well as the sound of the talker's voice. Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is hard to understand (e.g., background noise). Prior work has suggested that specialized regions of the brain may play a critical role in integrating information from visual and auditory speech. Here, we show a complementary mechanism relying on synchronized brain activity among sensory and motor regions may also play a critical role. These findings encourage reconceptualizing audiovisual integration in the context of coordinated network activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior-Posterior Hippocampal Dynamics Support Working Memory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is a locus of working memory (WM) with anterior and posterior subregions that differ in their transcriptional and external connectivity patterns. However, the involvement and functional connections between these subregions in WM processing are poorly understood. To address these issues, we recorded intracranial EEG from the anterior and the posterior hippocampi in humans (seven females and seven males) who maintained a set of letters in their WM. We found that WM maintenance was accompanied by elevated low-frequency activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus and by increased theta/alpha band (3&ndash;12 Hz) phase synchronization between anterior and posterior subregions. Cross-frequency and Granger prediction analyses consistently showed that the correct WM trials were associated with theta/alpha band-coordinated unidirectional influence from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus. In contrast, WM errors were associated with bidirectional interactions between the anterior and posterior hippocampus. These findings imply that theta/alpha band synchrony within the hippocampus may support successful WM via a posterior to anterior influence. A combination of intracranial recording and a fine-grained atlas may be of value in understanding the neural mechanisms of WM processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Working memory (WM) is crucial to everyday functioning. The hippocampus has been proposed to be a subcortical node involved in WM processes. Previous studies have suggested that the anterior and posterior hippocampi differ in their external connectivity patterns and gene expression. However, it remains unknown whether and how human hippocampal subregions are recruited and coordinated during WM tasks. Here, by recording intracranial electroencephalography simultaneously from both hippocampal subregions, we found enhanced power in both areas and increased phase synchronization between them. Furthermore, correct WM trials were associated with a unidirectional influence from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus, whereas error trials were correlated with bidirectional interactions. These findings indicate a long-axis specialization in the human hippocampus during WM processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decreasing Alertness Modulates Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to make decisions based on external information, prior knowledge, and evidence is a crucial aspect of cognition and may determine the success and survival of an organism. Despite extensive work on decision-making mechanisms/models, understanding the effects of alertness on neural and cognitive processes remain limited. Here we use EEG and behavioral modeling to characterize cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making in awake/low alertness periods in humans (14 male, 18 female) and characterize the compensatory mechanisms as alertness decreases. Well-rested human participants, changing between full-wakefulness and low alertness, performed an auditory tone-localization task, and its behavioral dynamics were quantified with psychophysics, signal detection theory, and drift-diffusion modeling, revealing slower reaction times, inattention to the left side of space, and a lower rate of evidence accumulation in periods of low alertness. Unconstrained multivariate pattern analysis (decoding) showed a ~280 ms delayed onset driven by low alertness of the neural signatures differentiating between left and right decision, with a spatial reconfiguration from centroparietal to lateral frontal regions 150-360 ms. To understand the neural compensatory mechanisms with decreasing alertness, we connected the evidence-accumulation behavioral parameter to the neural activity, showing in the early periods (125-325 ms) a shift in the associated patterns from right parietal regions in awake, to right frontoparietal during low alertness. This change in the neurobehavioral dynamics for central accumulation-related cognitive processes defines a clear reconfiguration of the brain networks' regions and dynamics needed for the implementation of decision-making, revealing mechanisms of resilience of cognition when challenged by decreased alertness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most living organisms make multiple daily decisions, and these require a degree of evidence from both the environment and the internal milieu. Such decisions are usually studied under sequential sampling models and involve making a behavioral choice based on sensory encoding, central accumulation, and motor implementation processes. Since there is little research on how decreasing alertness affects such cognitive processes, this study has looked at the cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making in people while fully awake and in drowsy periods. Using computational modeling of behavior and neural dynamics on human participants performing an auditory tone-localization task, we reveal how low alertness modulates evidence accumulation-related processes and its corresponding compensatory neural signatures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurocomputational Underpinnings of Expected Surprise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Predictive coding accounts of brain functions profoundly influence current approaches to perceptual synthesis. However, a fundamental paradox has emerged, that may be very relevant for understanding hallucinations, psychosis, or cognitive inflexibility: in some situations, surprise or prediction error-related responses can decrease when predicted, and yet, they can increase when we know they are predictable. This paradox is resolved by recognizing that brain responses reflect precision-weighted prediction error. This presses us to disambiguate the contributions of precision and prediction error in electrophysiology. To meet this challenge for the first time, we appeal to a methodology that couples an original experimental paradigm with fine dynamic modeling. We examined brain responses in healthy human participants (<I>N</I> = 20; 10 female) to unexpected and expected surprising sounds, assuming that the latter yield a smaller prediction error but much more amplified by a larger precision weight. Importantly, addressing this modulation requires the modeling of trial-by-trial variations of brain responses, that we reconstructed within a fronto-temporal network by combining EEG and MEG. Our results reveal an adaptive learning of surprise with larger integration of past (relevant) information in the context of expected surprises. Within the auditory hierarchy, this adaptation was found tied down to specific connections and reveals in particular precision encoding through neuronal excitability. Strikingly, these fine processes are automated as sound sequences were unattended. These findings directly speak to applications in psychiatry, where specifically impaired precision weighting has been suggested to be at the heart of several conditions such as schizophrenia and autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In perception as Bayesian inference and learning, context sensitivity expresses as the precision weighting of prediction errors. A subtle mechanism that is thought to lie at the heart of several psychiatric conditions. It is thus critical to identify its neurophysiological and computational underpinnings. We revisit the passive auditory oddball paradigm by manipulating sound predictability and use a twofold modeling approach to simultaneous EEG-MEG recordings: (1) trial-by-trial modeling of cortical responses reveals a context-sensitive perceptual learning process; (2) the dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of evoked responses uncovers the associated changes in synaptic efficacy. Predictability discloses a link between precision weighting and self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal (SP) cells, a result that paves the way to a fine description of healthy and pathologic perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Preservation of Eye Movements in Parkinson's Disease Is Stimulus- and Task-Specific</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that includes motor impairments, such as tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Although eye movement deficits are commonly found in saccade and pursuit tasks, preservation of oculomotor function has also been reported. Here we investigate specific task and stimulus conditions under which oculomotor function in PD is preserved. Sixteen PD patients and 18 healthy, age-matched controls completed a battery of movement tasks that included stationary or moving targets eliciting reactive or deliberate eye movements: pro-saccades, anti-saccades, visually guided pursuit, and rapid go/no-go manual interception. Compared with controls, patients demonstrated systematic impairments in tasks with stationary targets: pro-saccades were hypometric and anti-saccades were incorrectly initiated toward the cued target in ~35% of trials compared with 14% errors in controls. In patients, task errors were linked to short latency saccades, indicating abnormalities in inhibitory control. However, patients' eye movements in response to dynamic targets were relatively preserved. PD patients were able to track and predict a disappearing moving target and make quick go/no-go decisions as accurately as controls. Patients' interceptive hand movements were slower on average but initiated earlier, indicating adaptive processes to compensate for motor slowing. We conclude that PD patients demonstrate stimulus and task dependency of oculomotor impairments, and we propose that preservation of eye and hand movement function in PD is linked to a separate functional pathway through the superior colliculus-brainstem loop that bypasses the fronto-basal ganglia network. Our results demonstrate that studying oculomotor and hand movement function in PD can support disease diagnosis and further our understanding of disease progression and dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Eye movements are a promising clinical tool to aid in the diagnosis of movement disorders and to monitor disease progression. Although Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show some oculomotor abnormalities, it is not clear whether previously described eye movement impairments are task-specific. We assessed eye movements in PD under different visual (stationary vs moving targets) and movement (reactive vs deliberate) conditions. We demonstrate that PD patients are able to accurately track moving objects but make inaccurate eye movements toward stationary targets. The preservation of eye movements toward dynamic stimuli might enable patients to accurately act on the predicted motion path of the moving target. These results can inform the development of tools for the rehabilitation or maintenance of functional performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Do You Feel the Rhythm: Dynamic Motor-Auditory Interactions Are Involved in the Imagination of Hierarchical Timing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Predicting and organizing patterns of events is important for humans to survive in a dynamically changing world. The motor system has been proposed to be actively, and necessarily, engaged in not only the production but the perception of rhythm by organizing hierarchical timing that influences auditory responses. It is not yet well understood how the motor system interacts with the auditory system to perceive and maintain hierarchical structure in time. This study investigated the dynamic interaction between auditory and motor functional sources during the perception and imagination of musical meters. We pursued this using a novel method combining high-density EEG, EMG, and motion capture with independent component analysis to separate motor and auditory activity during meter imagery while robustly controlling against covert movement. We demonstrated that endogenous brain activity in both auditory and motor functional sources reflects the imagination of binary and ternary meters in the absence of corresponding acoustic cues or overt movement at the meter rate. We found clear evidence for hypothesized motor-to-auditory information flow at the beat rate in all conditions, suggesting a role for top-down influence of the motor system on auditory processing of beat-based rhythms, and reflecting an auditory-motor system with tight reciprocal informational coupling. These findings align with and further extend a set of motor hypotheses from beat perception to hierarchical meter imagination, adding supporting evidence to active engagement of the motor system in auditory processing, which may more broadly speak to the neural mechanisms of temporal processing in other human cognitive functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans live in a world full of hierarchically structured temporal information, the accurate perception of which is essential for understanding speech and music. Music provides a window into the brain mechanisms of time perception, enabling us to examine how the brain groups musical beats into, for example a march or waltz. Using a novel paradigm combining measurement of electrical brain activity with data-driven analysis, this study directly investigates motor-auditory connectivity during meter imagination. Findings highlight the importance of the motor system in the active imagination of meter. This study sheds new light on a fundamental form of perception by demonstrating how auditory-motor interaction may support hierarchical timing processing, which may have clinical implications for speech and motor rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Theta-Burst Stimulation of Primary Afferents Drives Long-Term Potentiation in the Spinal Cord and Persistent Pain via {alpha}2{delta}-1-Bound NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the spinal dorsal horn reflect activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and central sensitization in chronic pain. Tetanic high-frequency stimulation is commonly used to induce LTP in the spinal cord. However, primary afferent nerves often display low-frequency, rhythmic bursting discharges in painful conditions. Here, we determined how theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of primary afferents impacts spinal cord synaptic plasticity and nociception in male and female mice. We found that TBS induced more LTP, whereas tetanic stimulation induced more LTD, in mouse spinal lamina II neurons. TBS triggered LTP, but not LTD, in 50% of excitatory neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2). By contrast, TBS induced LTD and LTP in 12&ndash;16% of vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-expressing inhibitory neurons. Nerve injury significantly increased the prevalence of TBS-induced LTP in VGluT2-expressing, but not VGAT-expressing, lamina II neurons. Blocking NMDARs, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin, or &alpha;2-1 knockout abolished TBS-induced LTP in lamina II neurons. Also, disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction with &alpha;2-1Tat peptide prevented TBS-induced LTP in VGluT2-expressing neurons. Furthermore, TBS of the sciatic nerve induced long-lasting allodynia and hyperalgesia in wild-type, but not &alpha;2-1 knockout, mice. TBS significantly increased the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction and synaptic trafficking in the spinal cord. In addition, treatment with NMDAR antagonists, gabapentin, or &alpha;2-1Tat peptide reversed TBS-induced pain hypersensitivity. Therefore, TBS-induced primary afferent input causes a neuropathic pain-like phenotype and LTP predominantly in excitatory dorsal horn neurons via &alpha;2-1-dependent NMDAR activation. &alpha;2-1-bound NMDARs may be targeted for reducing chronic pain development at the onset of tissue/nerve injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spinal dorsal horn synaptic plasticity is a hallmark of chronic pain. Although sensory nerves display rhythmic bursting discharges at theta frequencies during painful conditions, the significance of this naturally occurring firing activity in the induction of spinal synaptic plasticity is largely unknown. In this study, we found that theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of sensory nerves induced LTP mainly in excitatory dorsal horn neurons and that the prevalence of TBS-induced LTP was potentiated by nerve injury. This TBS-driven synaptic plasticity required &alpha;2-1 and its interaction with NMDARs. Furthermore, TBS of sensory nerves induced persistent pain, which was maintained by &alpha;2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, TBS-induced LTP at primary afferent&ndash;dorsal horn neuron synapses is an appropriate cellular model for studying mechanisms of chronic pain.</p>

First, we retrieved all influenza-related articles using an advanced PubMed search query, then we inputted the resulted query into Altmetric explorer. We then calculated the average AAS for each month during the years 2012-2018. Results: A total of 24,964 PubMed documents were extracted, among them, 12,395 documents had at least one attention. We found a significant difference in mean AAS between February and each of January and March (p< 0.001, mean difference of 117.4 and 460.7, respectively). We found a significant difference between June and each of May and July (p< 0.001, mean difference of 1221.4 and 162.7, respectively). We also found a significant difference between October and each of September and November (p< 0.001, mean difference of 88.8 and 154.8, respectively). Conclusion: We observed a seasonal trend in the attention toward influenza-related research, with three annual peaks that correlated with the beginning, peak, and end of influenza seasons in the USA, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anomalous energy consumption detection using a Naïve Bayes approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Industrial energy management has emerged as an important component in monitoring energy consumption particularly with the recent trend of migrating towards IR 4.0. The capability to detect anomalies is essential as it serves as a precautionary step for real-time response to mitigate the maximum demand penalty. The purpose of this research was to develop a high accuracy anomalies detection algorithm to identify anomalies in the energy consumption data recorded by a smart meter. Methods: The proposed algorithm utilized supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, namely Isolation Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes.  The data were first labeled by using Isolation Forest to categorize them into normal and abnormal groups. This was followed by Gaussian Naïve Bayes to classify and predict the anomalies of the smart meter reading. Results: These machine learning techniques showed significant accuracy in predicting the anomalies in smart meter readings. The data used were simulated data collected in less than a month with 30-minute reading intervals.  The data were divided into testing and validation sets according to a ratio of 7:3. The balanced accuracy score in predicting anomalies for each different smart meter was above 89%. The average precision, average recall and average F1 score for the normal data were 98%, 99% and 98%, respectively. Whereas the corresponding scores for the abnormal data set were 95%, 90% and 92%. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm is a hybrid approach based on Isolation Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes and it provided satisfactory accuracy in anomaly electricity consumption detection based on smart meter readings. The study presents a quick and simple method for categorizing energy consumption data as normal or abnormal, which assists in automatically labelling vast datasets of energy consumption readings. The proposed approach establishes a fundamental framework for predicting the occurrence of anomalies in the industrial energy management system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and factors associated with anemia among children under five years of age in Rombo district, Kilimanjaro region, Northern Tanzania [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Anemia is a severe public health problem affecting more than half of children under five years of age in low-, middle- and high-income countries. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among children under five years of age in northern Tanzania. Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Rombo district, Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania, in April 2016. Multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 602 consenting mothers and their children aged 6-59 months and interviewed using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Stata version 15.1. We used generalized linear models (binomial family and logit link function) with a robust variance estimator to determine factors associated with anemia. Results: Prevalence of anemia was 37.9%, and it was significantly higher among children aged 6-23 months (48.3%) compared to those aged 24-59 months (28.5%). There were no significant differences in anemia prevalence by sex of the child. Adjusted for other factors, children aged 6-23 months had over two times higher odds of being anemic (OR=2.47, 95% CI 1.73, 3.53, p<0.001) compared to those aged 24-59 months. No significant association was found between maternal and nutritional characteristics with anemia among children in this study. Conclusion: Prevalence of anemia was lower than the national and regional estimates, and it still constitutes a significant public health problem, especially among children aged 6-23 months. The study recommends iron supplementation, food fortification, dietary diversification, and management of childhood illnesses interventions for mothers and children under two years.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differential enrichment of yeast DNA in SARS-CoV-2 and related genomes supports synthetic origin hypothesis [version 3; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain; for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its critical domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast DNA encoding for the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a passage model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that among SARS-like coronaviruses only the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain information that points to a synthetic passage in genetically modified yeast cells. Our data specifically allow the identification of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a potential recombination donor for the critical furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparisons of the effects of solute interactions on partition coefficient, kD, in selected binary immiscible solvents: a case of oxalic acid and succinic acid [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The molecular distributions of solutes in binary immiscible solvents as used in partition coefficient technique serve as measures of the solute separation, concentration and beneficiation from contaminants. Methods: The effects of solute interactions on partition coefficient, kD, in selected binary immiscible solvents were investigated at 300C and atmospheric pressure. The activities from the interactions with changes of concentrations within the solvents were analysed. These were done using simple titration method. The solutes were distributed in the binary solvents and the concentrations from the two layers formed were determined by titration method. The interactions of oxalic acid and succinic acid in carbon tetrachloride-water, diethyl ether-water, and n-hexane-water were studied for the partition coefficient values in the respective systems, to determine the nature and degree of the interfering reactions that are affecting the distributions, and to ascertain the best binary solvents from the three systems. Results: Oxalic acid has the partition coefficient of 0.0738 in carbon tetrachloride-water with the dimerization constant of -15.7092 and ionization constant of 0.0303. Oxalic acid has the distribution coefficient of 0.0173, dimerization constant of 144.0167 and the ionization constant of 0.0035 in diethyl ether-water. Oxalic acid has the partition coefficient of 0.0279, dimerization constant of 20.2798 and ionization constant of 0.0019 in n-hexane-water. Succinic acid has the partition coefficient of -0.05617, dimerization constant of -18.5655 and ionization constant of 0.0284 in carbon tetrachloride-water. In diethyl ether-water, succinic acid has the partition coefficient of 0.0427, dimerization constant of -18.1611 and ionization constant of 0.0332. In n-hexane-water, succinic acid has the partition coefficient of -0.04274, dimerization constant of 71.9491 and ionization constant of 0.0265. Conclusion: From these results, carbon tetrachloride-water is recommended for the purification and extraction of oxalic acid from contaminants. Carbon tetrachloride-water is also the best binary immiscible solvent for succinic acid.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extended ensemble simulations of a SARS-CoV-2 nsp1–5’-UTR complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shun Sakuraba, Qilin Xie, Kota Kasahara, Junichi Iwakiri, Hidetoshi Kono</p>

Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 180-residue protein that blocks translation of host mRNAs in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Although it is known that SARS-CoV-2’s own RNA evades nsp1’s host translation shutoff, the molecular mechanism underlying the evasion was poorly understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the mechanism of the viral RNA evasion. Simulation results suggested that the stem loop structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5’-untranslated region (SL1) binds to both nsp1’s N-terminal globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The consistency of the results was assessed by modeling nsp1-40<i>S</i> ribosome structure based on reported nsp1 experiments, including the X-ray crystallographic structure analysis, the cryo-EM electron density map, and cross-linking experiments. The SL1 binding region predicted from the simulation was open to the solvent, yet the ribosome could interact with SL1. Cluster analysis of the binding mode and detailed analysis of the binding poses suggest residues Arg124, Lys47, Arg43, and Asn126 may be involved in the SL1 recognition mechanism, consistent with the existing mutational analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution enhances mutational robustness and suppresses the emergence of a new phenotype: A new computational approach for studying evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tadamune Kaneko, Macoto Kikuchi</p>

The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a new computational method to investigate the particularities of evolution. Second, we apply this method to a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and explore the evolution of mutational robustness and bistability. Living systems have developed their functions through evolutionary processes. To understand the particularities of this process theoretically, evolutionary simulation (ES) alone is insufficient because the outcomes of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. We need a reference system for comparison. An appropriate reference system for this purpose is an ensemble of the randomly sampled genotypes. However, generating high-fitness genotypes by simple random sampling is difficult because such genotypes are rare. In this study, we used the multicanonical Monte Carlo method developed in statistical physics to construct a reference ensemble of GRNs and compared it with the outcomes of ES. We obtained the following results. First, mutational robustness was significantly higher in ES than in the reference ensemble at the same fitness level. Second, the emergence of a new phenotype, bistability, was delayed in evolution. Third, the bistable group of GRNs contains many mutationally fragile GRNs compared with those in the non-bistable group. This suggests that the delayed emergence of bistability is a consequence of the mutation-selection mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy in COVID-19 patients globally: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, resulting in pneumonia. Apart from steroids, other anti-COVID drugs that have been studied appear to have little or no effect on COVID-19 pneumonia. There is a well-known history of inflammatory disease, including pneumonia, treated with low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT). It reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-1a (IL-1a), and leukocyte recruitment.   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, with keywords such as “radiotherapy,” “low-dose radiation therapy,” “low-dose irradiation,” “covid-19 pneumonia,” “SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,” and “covid pneumonia.” with additional filters for human studies and customized articles in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We reviewed randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies with a clearly defined intervention, including low-dose radiotherapy alone or in combination with any therapy to treat COVID-19 pneumonia from December 2019 to May 2021. Patients receiving standard or high-dose radiotherapy, including for other diseases, were excluded. Zotero software was used to collect and organize research from various databases, remove duplicates, extract relevant data, and record decisions. Participants’ demographics and baseline status were obtained from the full-text articles along with the intervention’s outcome/effect on patient status.  Results: Four studies with 61 participants that met the inclusion criteria were included. One was a double-blind randomized controlled trial, one a non-randomized trial, while the other two were single-arm clinical trials. Low-dose radiation therapy did not show any significant improvement in COVID-19 patients.  Conclusion: Only two studies included in this review demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory markers; however, patients were also given steroids or other drugs. Therefore, the confounding effects must be considered before drawing conclusions. This systematic review does not support mortality benefit, clinical course improvement, or imaging changes with LDRT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The improvement of inflammatory markers and disease progression among moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients: a cross-sectional study from two second referral hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To date, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has no definitive treatment. Thrombosis and hypercoagulation may occur in the advanced stage. Further study on how to use anticoagulants is still required to promote the best prognosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 110 moderate, 140 severe, and 81 critical patients receiving unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux was conducted. Data were collected from March 15th to August 31st 2020 at Universitas Airlangga and Husada Utama Hospital. A comparative study of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, all-cause mortality rate, length of stay, and days of death among three severities of COVID-19 was done. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine the correlation between inflammatory state after anti-coagulant with patients’ mortality. Results: Two deaths occurred in moderate cases, 36 deaths in severe cases, and 70 deaths in critical cases on ventilators. On day 13, moderate and severe groups showed decreased WBC, neutrophils, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p < 0.05). NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p<0.05) in critically ill and ventilated patients decreased. Day-13 evaluation revealed 32.73% decrease of inflammatory markers in moderate group; 32.86% in severe patients; and 16.05% in critically ill, ventilated patients. A significant correlation between day 13 inflammatory status with mortality was seen in moderate and critical cases with a ventilator (r=0.337; p< 0.05 and r=0.25; p 0.05). Inflammatory profile on day 6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; p < 0.05) and day 13 ([aOR] = 4.15; p < 0.05) was associated with patients’ mortality. Conclusions: Anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients lower inflammation markers. Evaluating inflammatory status is essential to predict the mortality. Inflammatory markers on day 13, based on the severity of COVID-19 and comorbidities, were associated with mortality in moderate and critical cases.

     alt="Neural heterogeneity underlying late adolescent motivational processing is linked to individual differences in behavioral sensation seeking"/>
<p>Adolescents completed two runs of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Using a data-driven person-specific network connectivity approach, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), we uncovered two subgroups for MID runs. During Run 01, subgroups significantly related to sensation seeking; however, during Run 02 subgroups did not significantly relate to sensation seeking.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent risk-taking, including sensation seeking (SS), is often attributed to developmental changes in connectivity among brain regions implicated in cognitive control and reward processing. Despite considerable scientific and popular interest in this neurodevelopmental framework, there are few empirical investigations of adolescent functional connectivity, let alone examinations of its links to SS behavior. The studies that have been done focus on mean-based approaches and leave unanswered questions about individual differences in neurodevelopment and behavior. The goal of this paper is to take a person-specific approach to the study of adolescent functional connectivity during a continuous motivational state, and to examine links between connectivity and self-reported SS behavior in 104 adolescents (<i>M</i>
<sub>Age</sub> = 19.3; <i>SD</i>
<sub>Age</sub> = 1.3). Using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), person-specific connectivity during two neuroimaging runs of a monetary incentive delay task was estimated among 12 a priori brain regions of interest representing reward, cognitive, and salience networks. Two data-driven subgroups were detected, a finding that was consistent between both neuroimaging runs, but associations with SS were only found in the first run, potentially reflecting neural habituation in the second run. Specifically, the subgroup that had unique connections between reward-related regions had greater SS and showed a distinctive relation between connectivity strength in the reward regions and SS. These findings provide novel evidence for heterogeneity in adolescent brain-behavior relations by showing that subsets of adolescents have unique associations between neural motivational processing and SS. Findings have broader implications for future work on reward processing, as they demonstrate that brain-behavior relations may attenuate across runs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The topic of typical sex and gender difference in empathy is examined in both a developmental and neuroscientific perspective. Empathy is construed as a multi-layered phenomenon with various degrees of complexity unfolding in ontogeny. The different components of empathy (i.e., affective, cognitive, and prosocial motivation) will be discussed as they interact and are expressed behaviorally. Significant sex/gender differences in empathy are discussed in relation to putative bottom-up or top-down processes underlying empathetic responses. The early onset and the pervasive presence of such sex/gender differences throughout the lifespan are further discussed in light of social and neurobiological modeling factors, including early socialization, brain's structural/functional variances, as well as genetics and hormonal factors.</p>

<p>Genotype differences in the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) that reduce SERT expression levels significantly alter mitochondrial abundance and gene expression in a brain region and sex-dependent manner.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex conditions attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. There is a growing body of evidence showing that serotonergic signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders and are linked as signaling through specific serotonin (5-HT) receptors drives mitochondrial biogenesis. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is important in these disorders as it regulates synaptic serotonin and therapeutically is the target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which are a major class of anti-depressant drug. Human allelic variants of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) such as the S/S variant, are associated with reduced SERT expression and increased susceptibility for developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Using a rat model that is haploinsufficient for SERT and displays reduced SERT expression similar to the human S/S variant, we demonstrate that reduced SERT expression modulates mitochondrial copy number and expression of respiratory chain electron transfer components in the brain. In the frontal cortex, genotype-related trends were opposing for males and females, such that reduced SERT expression led to increased expression of the Complex I subunit <i>mt-Nd1</i> in males but reduced expression in females. Our findings suggest that SERT expression and serotonergic signaling have a role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the brain. We speculate that the sexual dimorphism in mitochondrial abundance and gene expression contributes to the sex bias found in the incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as MDD and ASD.</p>

     alt="Dose-dependent effect of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein on visual function and optic nerve damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis"/>
<p>In rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increasing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) quantity produced optic nerve (ON) damage in a dose-dependent gradient. Visual function was measured through visual evoked potential (VEP), with final ON histology. Forty and fifty micrograms of MOG resulted in VEP latency increase, correlating with demyelination, whereas 60 µg caused VEP amplitude decrease associated with axonal loss. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Female Dark Agouti rats were immunized with increasing doses of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis. Typical EAE motor impairments were assessed daily and noninvasive visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded at baseline and 5 weeks after immunization, with final histopathology of optic nerves (ONs). Immunized rats exhibited a relapsing-remitting clinical course. Both VEP and histological abnormalities were detected in a MOG dose-dependent gradient. Increasing MOG dosage augmented visual function impairment in EAE, which could be monitored with VEP recording to assess demyelination and axonal loss along ONs.</p>

<p>The early chronic melatonin administration modifies the expression of key molecules involved in cognitive process in a male murine transgenic model of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The results show that melatonin may be a possible adjuvant therapeutic strategy in ASDs and encourage new clinical trials.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders sharing common features related to impaired social and communication abilities in addition to stereotyped behaviors. ASD patients present encephalic morphological, physiological, and biomolecular alterations with low levels of melatonin due to alterations in its pathways. Therefore, even if ASDs have traditionally been framed as behavioral disorders, several lines of evidence are accumulating that ASDs are characterized by certain anatomical and physiological abnormalities, including oxidative stress and inflammation in peripheral biomarkers, but likewise present in human brain tissue also characterized by alterations in synaptic remodeling and neuromodulation. Melatonin has also protective and antioxidant properties, so we can therefore hypothesize that alterations in melatonin's pathways may be one of the causes of the symptomatology of autism. The aim of the present study was to analyze the beneficial effect induced by melatonin administration and its possible mechanism of action in a transgenic mouse model of autism, immediately after weaning. The male mice were daily treated <i>per os</i> with melatonin (10 mg/Kg/day) or vehicle for 8 weeks starting from the sixth week of life. The antioxidant modulation, the GABAergic/glutamatergic impairment, and the synaptic remodeling in the prefrontal cortex have been evaluated. Social and repetitive behaviors were also evaluated. The behavioral results showed no statistical evidences, instead the immunohistochemical results indicated the ability of melatonin to promote the activity of antioxidant system, the GABAergic/glutamatergic equilibrium, and the synaptic remodeling. The results show that melatonin may be a possible adjuvant therapeutic strategy in ASDs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions whose shared core features are impairments in social interaction and communication as well as restricted patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The significant and consistent male preponderance in ASD prevalence has historically affected the scientific knowledge of autism in females as regards, inter alia, the clinical presentation, the genetic architecture, and the structural brain underpinnings. Indeed, females with ASD are under-investigated as samples recruited for clinical research typically reflect the strong male bias of the disorder. In the last years, the study of the various aspects of sex/gender (s/g) differences in ASD is gaining increased clinical and research interest resulting in a growing number of investigations on this topic. Here, I review and discuss evidence emerged from epidemiological, clinical, and neuroimaging studies in the last decade focusing on s/g differences in children with ASD. These studies are the prerequisites for the development of assessment and treatment practices which take into consideration s/g differences in ASD. Ultimately, a better understanding of s/g differences aims at improving healthcare for both ASD males and females.</p>

     alt="Elucidation of pathological mechanism caused by human disease mutation in CaMKIIβ"/>
<p>We elucidated the pathogenic mechanism of the CaMKIIβ P213L mutation identified in a patient with neurodevelopmental disorder by next generation sequencing. The functional role of the P213 site has not been understood, but we found that the mutation at this site caused destabilization and degradation of CaMKIIβ <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in motor dysfunction of mutant mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently, we have identified CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ mutations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders by whole exome sequencing study. Most CaMKII mutants have increased phosphorylation of Thr286/287, which induces autonomous activity of CaMKII, using cell culture experiments. In this study, we explored the pathological mechanism of motor dysfunction observed exclusively in a patient with Pro213Leu mutation in CaMKIIβ using a mouse model of the human disease. The homozygous CaMKIIβ Pro213Leu knockin mice showed age-dependent motor dysfunction and growth failure from 2 weeks after birth. In the cerebellum, the mutation did not alter the mRNA transcript level, but the CaMKIIβ protein level was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, in contrast to previous result from cell culture, Thr287 phosphorylation of CaMKIIβ was also reduced. CaMKIIβ Pro213Leu knockin mice showed similar motor dysfunction as CaMKIIβ knockout mice, newly providing evidence for a loss of function rather than a gain of function. Our disease model mouse showed similar phenotypes of the patient, except for epileptic seizures. We clearly demonstrated that the pathological mechanism is a reduction of mutant CaMKIIβ in the brain, and the physiological aspects of mutation were greatly different between <i>in vivo</i> and cell culture.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Rapid Identification of Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Variants by mRNA Display</a></h4>

              
                Tanaka et al identify a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-targeted potentially neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) by mRNA display. Structural analyses reveal distinct binding modes, including targeting of rare cryptic S receptor-binding domain epitopes. A further engineered ACE2-blocking nAb show sustained binding to S RBD with the E484K and L452R substitutions

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Induces Robust Specific and Cross-reactive IgG and Unequal Neutralizing Antibodies in Naïve and Previously Infected Recipients</a></h4>

              
                Narowski et al. investigate mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses in 168 healthy individuals with longitudinal specimens. After complete vaccination, both previously infected and naïve individuals develop comparably robust SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. However, neutralizing antibody response to vaccination is variable among these individuals, supporting future tailored vaccination strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
