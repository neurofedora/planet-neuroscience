<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Loss-of-function variants in <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> or <em class="a-plus-plus">EP300</em> result in Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS). The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em>, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Mechanisms and progression of ischemic injuries in the retina are still incompletely clarified. Therefore, the time course of microglia activation as well as resulting cytokine expression and downstream signaling were investigated. Ischemia was induced in one eye by transiently elevated intraocular pressure (60 min) followed by reperfusion; the other eye served as a control. Eyes were processed for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Already 2 h after ischemia, more microglia/macrophages were in an active state in the ischemia group. This was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. Activation of TLR3, TLR2, and the adaptor molecule Myd88 was also observed after 2 h. NFκB revealed a wave-like activation pattern. In addition, an extrinsic caspase pathway activation was noted at early time points, while enhanced numbers of cleaved caspase 3<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> cells could be observed in ischemic retinae throughout the study. Retinal ischemia induced an early and strong microglia/macrophage response as well as cytokine and apoptotic activation processes. Moreover, in early and late ischemic damaging processes, TLR expression and downstream signaling were involved, suggesting an involvement in neuronal death in ischemic retinae.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The effective prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) needs to be explored, and the effect of preoperative pain on POCD remains unclear. We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial, central nervous system, immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Evidence suggests a steady rise in MS prevalence over the past five decades in the United States and around the world. Even with increased understanding of immunology, the specific etiological trigger of MS remains unknown. Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease–modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Due to molecular mimicry, maternal antibacterial antibodies are suspected to promote neurodevelopmental changes in the offspring that finally can cause disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Using a human first trimester prenatal brain multiprotein array (MPA), we demonstrate here that antibodies to the digestive tract bacteria <em class="a-plus-plus">Helicobacter pylori</em> (α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em>) and <em class="a-plus-plus">Campylobacter jejuni</em> (α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>) interact with different synaptic proteins, including the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 5 (Syt5). Interactions of both antisera with Syt5 were confirmed by Western blot with a HEK293-cells overexpression lysate of this protein. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed SiMa cells to express Syt5, which also co-migrated with a band/spot labeled by either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>. Functionally, a 12-h pretreatment of SiMa cells with 10 μg/ml of either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em> resulted in a significant reduction of acetylcholine(ACh)-dependent calcium signals as compared to controls. Also ACh-dependent vesicle recycling was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>. Similar effects were observed upon pretreatment of SiMa cells with Syt5-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the present study supports the view that prenatal maternal antibacterial immune responses towards <em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> and by this to Syt5 are able to cause functional changes, which in the end might contribute also to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and development of stroke. However, the regulatory function of many lncRNAs in large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) has not been fully elucidated. Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis recently proposed by Pandolfi, the present study was conducted using experimental techniques and bioinformatics to investigate the expression and regulatory function of a lncRNA involved in the development of LAA. The lncRNAs differentially expressed in stroke were obtained using meta-analysis, and one lncRNA was selected for experimental studies on patients with LAA (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 100) and healthy controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 100) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The patients were also evaluated through meta-analysis to identify the function of the selected lncRNA, miRNAs, and mRNAs with altered expression in stroke. Finally, the experimental results and meta-analysis findings were integrated, and different functional groups were assigned. The results indicated that the level of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was significantly lower in the patients with LAA compared to the healthy control subjects (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the expression of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was inversely correlated with LAA (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 009, OR = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.786–0.965). In addition, a network of differentially expressed genes (DE genes) was created for miRNAs and mRNAs based on their association with lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1. Functional analysis showed that the DE genes in the network are involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs. The findings of the present study suggest that the downregulation of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 is associated with LAA development by interrupting the regulatory network of cells. The results of network analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 could influence the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> has been used for the past two decades as neuroprotective treatment in a variety of preterm conditions. Despite the putative advantages of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the short- and long-term molecular function of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent has not been fully elucidated. Neuregulin (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, in the biology of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We hypothesize that this pathway may be associated with the neuroprotective role of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub>. The current study aims to investigate the ability of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> to modulate the normal developing expression pattern of selected genes related to the NRG1-ErbB, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We demonstrate that overall short-term treatment of dam rats with MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> affects the expression of fetal brain NRG1, NRG3, ErbB4, GAD67, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine D<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> and D<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub> receptors, GluN1, and GluN2B. More specifically, the administration of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> alters the expression of NRG-ErbB, GAD67, TH, and D2R at early gestation day 16 (GD16) regardless of the activation of the maternal immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data suggest that MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> treatment may affect the expression of major neuronal systems and pathways mostly at an early gestation day. These changes might be an initial clue (foundation stone) in the molecular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent for the developmental brain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Psychosocial stress has been widely reported to contribute to psychiatric disturbances. Perturbations in the enzymes of GABAergic and cholinergic systems have been implicated as precursors in different stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 kDa (GAD67) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been recognized as prospective strategies for the prevention of psychosocial stress-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin, a neuro-active flavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruits, has been shown to produce memory-enhancing, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory activities similarly to ginseng, a very potent adaptogen. In this communication, we assessed the effect of naringin on social-defeat stress (SDS)-induced behavioral, GABAergic, cholinergic, oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes in mice using the resident–intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were culled into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 (normal- and SDS-controls) received sterile saline, groups 3–5 were given naringin (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) whereas group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, but followed by 10 min SDS (physical and psychological) exposure to groups 2–6 with aggressor–resident mice. Behavioral effects using Y-maze, elevated-plus maze, sociability, and tail-suspension tests were assessed on day 14. GAD67, AChE enzymes, and biomarkers of oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Naringin and ginseng reversed all SDS-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin increased the levels of GAD67 and decreased AChE activities in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Furthermore, naringin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), malondialdehyde, nitrite concentrations, and increased glutathione levels in a region-dependent manner. Our study suggests that naringin attenuated SDS-induced behavioral endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disease through increased GAD67 synthesis, inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative, nitrergic stress, and neuroinflammatory processes in stress-sensitive brain regions.</p>

<p>Insider threats are the cyber attacks from within the trusted entities of an
organization. Lack of real-world data and issue of data imbalance leave insider
threat analysis an understudied research area. To mitigate the effect of skewed
class distribution and prove the potential of multinomial classification
algorithms for insider threat detection, we propose an approach that combines
generative model with supervised learning to perform multi-class classification
using deep learning. The generative adversarial network (GAN) based insider
detection model introduces Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to
enrich minority class samples to provide data for multi-class anomaly
detection. The comprehensive experiments performed on the benchmark dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of introducing GAN derived synthetic data and
the capability of multi-class anomaly detection in insider activity analysis.
Moreover, the method is compared with other existing methods against different
parameters and performance metrics.

<p>Descent methods for deep networks are notoriously capricious: they require
careful tuning of step size, momentum and weight decay, and which method will
work best on a new benchmark is a priori unclear. To address this problem, this
paper conducts a combined study of neural architecture and optimisation,
leading to a new optimiser called Nero: the neuronal rotator. Nero trains
reliably without momentum or weight decay, works in situations where Adam and
SGD fail, and requires little to no learning rate tuning. Also, Nero's memory
footprint is ~ square root that of Adam or LAMB. Nero combines two ideas: (1)
projected gradient descent over the space of balanced networks; (2)
neuron-specific updates, where the step size sets the angle through which each
neuron's hyperplane turns. The paper concludes by discussing how this geometric
connection between architecture and optimisation may impact theories of
generalisation in deep learning.

<p>We here study a network of synaptic relations mingling excitatory and
inhibitory neuron nodes that displays oscillations quite similar to
electroencephalogram (EEG) brain waves, and identify abrupt variations brought
about by swift synaptic mediations. We thus conclude that corresponding changes
in EEG series surely come from the slowdown of the activity in neuron
populations due to synaptic restrictions. The latter happens to generate an
imbalance between excitation and inhibition causing a quick explosive increase
of excitatory activity, which turns out to be a (first-order) transition among
dynamic mental phases. Besides, near this phase transition, our model system
exhibits waves with a strong component in the so-called \textit{delta-theta
domain} that coexist with fast oscillations. These findings provide a simple
explanation for the observed \textit{delta-gamma} and \textit{theta-gamma
modulation} in actual brains, and open a serious and versatile path to
understand deeply large amounts of apparently erratic, easily accessible brain
data.

higher resolution, better energy-efficiency, and improved throughput. On
average, CrossLight offers 9.5x lower energy-per-bit and 15.9x higher

<p>Convolutional networks are successful, but they have recently been
outperformed by new neural networks that are equivariant under rotations and
translations. These new networks work better because they do not struggle with
learning each possible orientation of each image feature separately. So far,
they have been proposed for 2D and 3D data. Here we generalize them to 6D
diffusion MRI data, ensuring joint equivariance under 3D roto-translations in
image space and the matching 3D rotations in $q$-space, as dictated by the
image formation. Such equivariant deep learning is appropriate for diffusion
MRI, because microstructural and macrostructural features such as neural fibers
can appear at many different orientations, and because even
non-rotation-equivariant deep learning has so far been the best method for many
diffusion MRI tasks. We validate our equivariant method on multiple-sclerosis
lesion segmentation. Our proposed neural networks yield better results and
require fewer scans for training compared to non-rotation-equivariant deep
learning. They also inherit all the advantages of deep learning over classical
diffusion MRI methods. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/philip-mueller/equivariant-deep-dmri and can be used off the
shelf without understanding the mathematical background.

<p>Comprehensive benchmarking of clustering algorithms is rendered difficult by
two key factors: (i)~the elusiveness of a unique mathematical definition of
this unsupervised learning approach and (ii)~dependencies between the
generating models or clustering criteria adopted by some clustering algorithms
and indices for internal cluster validation. Consequently, there is no
consensus regarding the best practice for rigorous benchmarking, and whether
this is possible at all outside the context of a given application. Here, we
argue that synthetic datasets must continue to play an important role in the
evaluation of clustering algorithms, but that this necessitates constructing
benchmarks that appropriately cover the diverse set of properties that impact
clustering algorithm performance. Through our framework, HAWKS, we demonstrate
the important role evolutionary algorithms play to support flexible generation
of such benchmarks, allowing simple modification and extension. We illustrate
two possible uses of our framework: (i)~the evolution of benchmark data
consistent with a set of hand-derived properties and (ii)~the generation of
datasets that tease out performance differences between a given pair of
algorithms. Our work has implications for the design of clustering benchmarks
that sufficiently challenge a broad range of algorithms, and for furthering
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches.

<p>In large infrastructures such as dams, which have a relatively high economic
value, ensuring the proper operation of the associated hydraulic facilities in
different operating conditions is of utmost importance. To ensure the correct
and successful operation of the dam's hydraulic equipment and prevent possible
damages, including gates and downstream tunnel, to build laboratory models and
perform some tests are essential (the advancement of the smart sensors based on
artificial intelligence is essential). One of the causes of damage to dam
bottom outlets is cavitation in downstream and between the gates, which can
impact on dam facilities, and air aeration can be a solution to improve it. In
the present study, six dams in different provinces in Iran has been chosen to
evaluate the air entrainment in the downstream tunnel experimentally. Three
artificial neural networks (ANN) based machine learning (ML) algorithms are
used to model and predict the air aeration in the bottom outlet. The proposed
models are trained with genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization
(PSO), i.e., ANN-GA, ANN-PSO, and ANFIS-PSO. Two hydrodynamic variables, namely
volume rate and opening percentage of the gate, are used as inputs into all
bottom outlet models. The results showed that the most optimal model is
ANFIS-PSO to predict the dependent value compared with ANN-GA and ANN-PSO. The
importance of the volume rate and opening percentage of the dams' gate
parameters is more effective for suitable air aeration.

<p>In this paper, we propose self-reorganizing and rejuvenating convolutional
neural networks; a biologically inspired method for improving the computational
resource utilization of neural networks. The proposed method utilizes the
channel activations of a convolution layer in order to reorganize that layers
parameters. The reorganized parameters are clustered to avoid parameter
redundancies. As such, redundant neurons with similar activations are merged
leaving room for the remaining parameters to rejuvenate. The rejuvenated
parameters learn different features to supplement those learned by the
reorganized surviving parameters. As a result, the network capacity utilization
increases improving the baseline network performance without any changes to the
network structure. The proposed method can be applied to various network
architectures during the training stage, or applied to a pre-trained model
improving its performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed method
is model-agnostic and can be applied to any backbone architecture increasing
its performance due to the elevated utilization of the network capacity.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06847">Representing Alzheimer's Disease Progression via Deep Prototype Tree. (arXiv:2102.06847v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>For decades, a variety of predictive approaches have been proposed and
evaluated in terms of their predicting capability for Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
and its precursor - mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Most of them focused on
prediction or identification of statistical differences among different
clinical groups or phases (e.g., longitudinal studies). The continuous nature
of AD development and transition states between successive AD related stages
have been overlooked, especially in binary or multi-class classification.
Though a few progression models of AD have been studied recently, they mainly
designed to determine and compare the order of specific biomarkers. How to
effectively predict the individual patient's status within a wide spectrum of
AD progression has been understudied. In this work, we developed a novel
structure learning method to computationally model the continuum of AD
progression as a tree structure. By conducting a novel prototype learning with
a deep manner, we are able to capture intrinsic relations among different
clinical groups as prototypes and represent them in a continuous process for AD
development. We named this method as Deep Prototype Learning and the learned
tree structure as Deep Prototype Tree - DPTree. DPTree represents different
clinical stages as a trajectory reflecting AD progression and predict clinical
status by projecting individuals onto this continuous trajectory. Through this
way, DPTree can not only perform efficient prediction for patients at any
stages of AD development (77.8% accuracy for five groups), but also provide
more information by examining the projecting locations within the entire AD
progression process.

<p>In this paper, we introduce a Model-based Algorithm Turning Engine, namely
MATE, where the parameters of an algorithm are represented as expressions of
the features of a target optimisation problem. In contrast to most static
(feature-independent) algorithm tuning engines such as irace and SPOT, our
approach aims to derive the best parameter configuration of a given algorithm
for a specific problem, exploiting the relationships between the algorithm
parameters and the features of the problem. We formulate the problem of finding
the relationships between the parameters and the problem features as a symbolic
regression problem and we use genetic programming to extract these expressions.
For the evaluation, we apply our approach to configuration of the (1+1) EA and
RLS algorithms for the OneMax, LeadingOnes, BinValue and Jump optimisation
problems, where the theoretically optimal algorithm parameters to the problems
are available as functions of the features of the problems. Our study shows
that the found relationships typically comply with known theoretical results,
thus demonstrating a new opportunity to consider model-based parameter tuning
as an effective alternative to the static algorithm tuning engines.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Hands play a fundamental role in everyday behaviour. Nevertheless, healthy adults show striking misrepresentations of their hands which have been documented by a wide range of studies addressing various aspects of body representation. For example, when asked to indicate the location within the hand of the knuckles, people place them substantially farther forward than they actually are. Previous research, however, has focused exclusively on the knuckles at the base of each finger, not considering the other knuckles in the fingers. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate conceptual knowledge of the structure of the whole hand, by investigating judgements of the location of all 14 knuckle joints in the hand. Participants localised each of the 14 knuckles of their own hand (Experiment 1) or of the experimenter’s hand (Experiment 2) on a hand silhouette. We measured whether there are systematic localisation biases. The results showed highly similar pattern of mislocalisation for the knuckles of one’s own hand and those of another person’s hand, suggesting that people share an abstract conceptual knowledge about the hand structure. In line with previous reports, we showed that the metacarpophalangeal joints at the base of the fingers are judged as substantially father forward in the hand than they actually are. Moreover, for the first time we showed a gradient of this bias, with progressive reduction of distal bias from more proximal to more distal joints. In sum, people think their finger segments are roughly the same, and that their fingers are shorter than they are.</p>

<p>Whereas, there is data to support that cuneothalamic projections predominantly reach a topographically confined volume of the rat thalamus, the ventroposterior lateral (VPL) nucleus, recent findings show that cortical neurons that process tactile inputs are widely distributed across the neocortex. Since cortical neurons project back to the thalamus, the latter observation would suggest that thalamic neurons could contain information about tactile inputs, in principle regardless of where in the thalamus they are located. Here we use a previously introduced electrotactile interface for producing sets of highly reproducible tactile afferent spatiotemporal activation patterns from the tip of digit 2 and record neurons throughout widespread parts of the thalamus of the anesthetized rat. We find that a majority of thalamic neurons, regardless of location, respond to single pulse tactile inputs and generate spike responses to such tactile stimulation patterns that can be used to identify which of the inputs that was provided, at above-chance decoding performance levels. Thalamic neurons with short response latency times, compatible with a direct tactile afferent input via the cuneate nucleus, were typically among the best decoders. Thalamic neurons with longer response latency times as a rule were also found to be able to decode the digit 2 inputs, though typically at a lower decoding performance than the thalamic neurons with presumed direct cuneate inputs. These findings provide support for that tactile information arising from any specific skin area is widely available in the thalamocortical circuitry.</p>

<p>Novelty detection is a core feature of behavioral adaptation and involves cascades of neuronal responses—from initial evaluation of the stimulus to the encoding of new representations—resulting in the behavioral ability to respond to unexpected inputs. In the past decade, a new important novelty detection feature, beta2 (~20–30 Hz) oscillations, has been described in the hippocampus (HC). However, the interactions between beta2 and the hippocampal network are unknown, as well as the role—or even the presence—of beta2 in other areas involved with novelty detection. In this work, we combined multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings with novelty-related behavioral tasks in mice to describe the oscillatory dynamics associated with novelty detection in the CA1 region of the HC, parietal cortex, and mid-prefrontal cortex. We found that transient beta2 power increases were observed only during interaction with novel contexts and objects, but not with familiar contexts and objects. Also, robust theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was observed during the exploration of novel environments. Surprisingly, bursts of beta2 power had strong coupling with the phase of delta-range oscillations. Finally, the parietal and mid-frontal cortices had strong coherence with the HC in both theta and beta2. These results highlight the importance of beta2 oscillations in a larger hippocampal-cortical circuit, suggesting that beta2 plays a role in the mechanism for detecting and modulating behavioral adaptation to novelty.</p>

<p>This study adopted diffusion tensor imaging to detect alterations in the diffusion parameters of the white matter fiber in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and used quantitative susceptibility mapping to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility. However, whether the changes of susceptibility values due to excessive iron in the basal ganglia have correlations with the alterations of the diffusion properties of the white matter in patients with AD are still unknown. We aim to investigate the correlations among magnetic susceptibility values of the basal ganglia, diffusion indexes of the white matter, and cognitive function in patients with AD. Thirty patients with AD and nineteen healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Diffusion indexes of the whole brain were detected using tract-based spatial statistics. The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus were selected as regions of interest, and their magnetic susceptibility values were measured. Compared with HCs, patients with AD showed that there were significantly increased axial diffusivity (AxD) in the internal capsule, superior corona radiata (SCR), and right anterior corona radiata (ACR); increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule, ACR, and genu of the corpus callosum (GCC); and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right ACR and GCC. The alterations of RD values, FA values, and susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD were correlated with cognitive scores. Besides, AxD values in the right internal capsule, ACR, and SCR were positively correlated with the magnetic susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD. Our findings revealed that the magnetic susceptibility of the caudate nucleus may be an MRI-based biomarker of the cognitive dysfunction of AD and abnormal excessive iron distribution in the basal ganglia had adverse effects on the diffusion properties of the white matter.</p>

<p>Early- and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often exhibit distinct features. We sought to compare overall white matter connectivity and evaluate the pathological factors (amyloid, tau, and vascular pathologies) that affect the disruption of connectivity in these two groups. A total of 50 early- and 38 late-onset AD patients, as well as age-matched cognitively normal participants, were enrolled and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to construct fractional anisotropy-weighted white matter connectivity maps. [<sup>18</sup>F]-THK5351 PET, [<sup>18</sup>F]-Flutemetamol PET, and magnetic resonance imaging were used for the evaluation of tau and related astrogliosis, amyloid, and small vessel disease markers (lacunes and white matter hyperintensities). Cluster-based statistics was performed for connectivity comparisons and correlation analysis between connectivity disruption and the pathological markers. Both patient groups exhibited significantly disrupted connectivity compared to their control counterparts with distinct patterns. Only THK retention was related to connectivity disruption in early-onset AD patients, and this disruption showed correlations with most cognitive scores, while late-onset AD patients had disrupted connectivity correlated with amyloid deposition, white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes in which only a few cognitive scores showed associations. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of connectivity disruption and its effects on cognition are distinct between EOAD and LOAD.</p>

<p>Studies on weak current stimulation (1–2 mA) examine effects on neuronal cells for the treatment of neurological diseases, like depression. Ocular current stimulation showed positive effects on retinal nerve cells which indicate that neurodegenerative ocular diseases, e.g., glaucoma, can be treated with current stimulation of the eye. However, up to now it remains unclear which exact retinal cells can be influenced. During an ocular direct current stimulation, a significant reduction of the characteristic P50 amplitude of a pattern-reversal electroretinogram (PERG) was found for an anodal and a cathodal stimulation. This current stimulation effect could originate from the modulation of pre-ganglion cell activity or by changes in local ON and OFF responses of ganglion cells. For clarification, we investigate acute direct current stimulation effects on a full field electroretinogram (ERG), which represents the activity of pre-ganglion cells (specifically cones and bipolar cells). The ERG from 15 subjects was evaluated before (ERG 1) and during (ERG 2) an ocular direct current stimulation with 800 μA over 5 min. The current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple. For ERG measurements, sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes were positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). The volunteers were stimulated in three independent sessions, each with a different current application (randomized order): cathodal polarity, anodal polarity (referred to the electrode around the eye), or sham stimulation. The changes between the two ERG measurements of the characteristic full field ERG amplitudes, a-wave, b-wave, and b′-wave (b-wave measured from zero line) were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Comparing before to during the current stimulation for all applications, the ERG waves showed no effects on amplitudes or latencies. Furthermore, no significant difference between the cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation could be found by a Friedman test. These results indicate an unlikely contribution of pre-ganglion cells to the previously reported stimulation effect on PERG signals.</p>

<p>We present a framework for the topological and semantic assembly of multiscale physiology route maps. The framework, called ApiNATOMY, consists of a knowledge representation (KR) model and a set of knowledge management (KM) tools. Using examples of ApiNATOMY route maps, we present a KR format that is suitable for the analysis and visualization by KM tools. The conceptual KR model provides a simple method for physiology experts to capture process interactions among anatomical entities. In this paper, we outline the KR model, modeling format, and the KM procedures to translate concise abstraction-based specifications into fully instantiated models of physiology processes.</p>

Background<p>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded to be at high risk of converting to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) can reflect functional deterioration while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of detecting white matter integrity. Our study aimed to investigate the structural and functional alterations to further reveal convergence and divergence among SCD, naMCI, and aMCI and how these contribute to cognitive deterioration.</p>Methods<p>We analyzed ALFF under slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz) bands and white matter fiber integrity among normal controls (CN), SCD, naMCI, and aMCI groups. Correlation analyses were further utilized among paired DTI alteration, ALFF deterioration, and cognitive decline.</p>Results<p>For ALFF calculation, ascended ALFF values were detected in the lingual gyrus (LING) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within SCD and naMCI patients, respectively. Descended ALFF values were presented mainly in the LING, SFG, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus in aMCI patients compared to CN, SCD, and naMCI groups. For DTI analyses, white matter alterations were detected within the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in aMCI patients and within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in naMCI patients. SCD patients presented alterations in both fasciculi. Correlation analyses revealed that the majority of these structural and functional alterations were associated with complicated cognitive decline. Besides, UF alterations were correlated with ALFF deterioration in the SFG within aMCI patients.</p>Conclusions<p>SCD shares structurally and functionally deteriorative characteristics with aMCI and naMCI, and tends to convert to either of them. Furthermore, abnormalities in white matter fibers may be the structural basis of abnormal brain activation in preclinical AD stages. Combined together, it suggests that structural and functional integration may characterize the preclinical AD progression.</p>

<p>Basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger are universal, regardless of the human species, and are governed by specific brain regions. A recent report revealed that mentalizing, which is the ability to estimate other individuals’ emotional states via facial expressions, can be preserved with the help of awake surgery. However, it is still questionable whether we can maintain the ability to understand others’ emotions by preserving the positive mapping sites of intraoperative assessment. Here, we demonstrated the cortical regions related to basic emotions via awake surgery for patients with frontal glioma and investigated the usefulness of functional mapping in preserving basic emotion. Of the 56 consecutive patients with right cerebral hemispheric glioma who underwent awake surgery at our hospital, intraoperative assessment of basic emotion could be successfully performed in 22 patients with frontal glioma and were included in our study. During surgery, positive responses were found in 18 points in 12 patients (54.5%). Of these, 15 points from 11 patients were found at the cortical level, mainly the premotor and posterior part of the prefrontal cortices. Then, we focused on cortical 15 positive mappings with 40 stimulations and investigated the types of emotions that showed errors by every stimulation. There was no specific rule for the region-emotional type, which was beyond our expectations. In the postoperative acute phase, the test score of basic emotion declined in nine patients, and of these, it decreased under the cut-off value (Z-score ≤ −1.65) in three patients. Although the total score declined significantly just after surgery (p = 0.022), it recovered within 3 months postoperatively. Our study revealed that through direct electrical stimulation (DES), the premotor and posterior parts of the prefrontal cortices are related to various kinds of basic emotion, but not a single one. When the region with a positive mapping site is preserved during operation, basic emotion function might be maintained although it declines transiently after surgery.</p>

<p>Understanding and producing embedded sequences according to supra-regular grammars in language has always been considered a high-level cognitive function of human beings, named “syntax barrier” between humans and animals. However, some neurologists recently showed that macaques could be trained to produce embedded sequences involving supra-regular grammars through a well-designed experiment paradigm. Via comparing macaques and preschool children's experimental results, they claimed that human uniqueness might only lie in the speed and learning strategy resulting from the chunking mechanism. Inspired by their research, we proposed a Brain-inspired Sequence Production Spiking Neural Network (SP-SNN) to model the same production process, followed by memory and learning mechanisms of the multi-brain region cooperation. After experimental verification, we demonstrated that SP-SNN could also handle embedded sequence production tasks, striding over the “syntax barrier.” SP-SNN used Population-Coding and STDP mechanism to realize working memory, Reward-Modulated STDP mechanism for acquiring supra-regular grammars. Therefore, SP-SNN needs to simultaneously coordinate short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP) mechanisms. Besides, we found that the chunking mechanism indeed makes a difference in improving our model's robustness. As far as we know, our work is the first one toward the “syntax barrier” in the SNN field, providing the computational foundation for further study of related underlying animals' neural mechanisms in the future.</p>

<p>Given the rapid development of light weight EEG devices which we have witnessed the past decade, it is reasonable to ask to which extent neuroscience could now be taken outside the lab. In this study, we have designed an EEG paradigm well suited for deployment “in the wild.” The paradigm is tested in repeated recordings on 20 subjects, on eight different occasions (4 in the laboratory, 4 in the subject's own home). By calculating the inter subject, intra subject and inter location variance, we find that the inter location variation for this paradigm is considerably less than the inter subject variation. We believe the paradigm is representative of a large group of other relevant paradigms. This means that given the positive results in this study, we find that if a research paradigm would benefit from being performed in less controlled environments, we expect limited problems in doing so.</p>

<p>The ability to identify and avoid environmental stimuli that signal danger is essential to survival. Our understanding of how the brain encodes aversive behaviors has been primarily focused on roles for the amygdala, hippocampus (HIPP), prefrontal cortex, ventral midbrain, and ventral striatum. Relatively little attention has been paid to contributions from the dorsal striatum (DS) to aversive learning, despite its well-established role in stimulus-response learning. Here, we review studies exploring the role of DS in aversive learning, including different roles for the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum in Pavlovian fear conditioning as well as innate and inhibitory avoidance (IA) behaviors. We outline how future investigation might determine specific contributions from DS subregions, cell types, and connections that contribute to aversive behavior.</p>

<p>While it is well-known that pre-stroke exercise conditioning reduces the incidence of stroke and the development of comorbidities, it is unclear whether post-stroke exercise conditioning is also neuroprotective. The present study investigated whether exercise postconditioning (PostE) induced neuroprotection and elucidated the involvement of SIRT1 regulation on the ROS/ER stress pathway. Adult rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by either: (1) resting; (2) mild exercise postconditioning (MPostE); or (3) intense exercise postconditioning (IPostE). PostE was initiated 24 h after reperfusion and performed on a treadmill. At 1 and 3 days thereafter, we determined infarct volumes, neurological defects, brain edema, apoptotic cell death through measuring pro- (BAX and Caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) proteins, and ER stress through the measurement of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Caspase-12, and SIRT1. Proteins were measured by Western blot. ROS production was detected by flow cytometry.Compared to resting rats, both MPostE and IPostE significantly decreased brain infarct volumes and edema, neurological deficits, ROS production, and apoptotic cell death. MPostE further increased Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2/BAX ratio as well as BAX and Caspase-3 expressions and ROS production (*p &lt; 0.05). Both PostE groups saw decreases in ER stress proteins, while MPostE demonstrated a further reduction in GRP78 (***p &lt; 0.001) and Caspase-12 (*p &lt; 0.05) expressions at 1 day and IRE1α (**p &lt; 0.01) and CHOP (*p &lt; 0.05) expressions at 3 days. Additionally, both PostE groups saw significant increases in SIRT1 expression.In this study, both mild and intense PostE levels induced neuroprotection after stroke through SIRT1 and ROS/ER stress pathway. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of SIRT1 on the ROS/ER stress pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke neuroprotection. The results suggest that mild exercise postconditioning might play a similar neuroprotective role as intensive exercise and could be an effective exercise strategy as well.</p>

<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is a highly conserved limbic structure in the vertebrate brain, located in the isthmus and rhombomere 1. It is formed by various populations that migrate from different sites to the distinct domains within the IPN: the prodromal, rostral interpeduncular, and caudal interpeduncular nuclei. The aim here was to identify genes that are differentially expressed across these domains, characterizing their putative functional roles and interactions. To this end, we screened the 2,038 genes in the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas database expressed at E18.5 and we identified 135 genes expressed within the IPN. The functional analysis of these genes highlighted an overrepresentation of gene families related to neuron development, cell morphogenesis and axon guidance. The interactome analysis within each IPN domain yielded specific networks that mainly involve members of the ephrin/Eph and Cadherin families, transcription factors and molecules related to synaptic neurotransmission. These results bring to light specific mechanisms that might participate in the formation, molecular regionalization, axon guidance and connectivity of the different IPN domains. This genoarchitectonic model of the IPN enables data on gene expression and interactions to be integrated and interpreted, providing a basis for the further study of the connectivity and function of this poorly understood nuclear complex under both normal and pathological conditions.</p>

Background<p>Accruing positron emission tomography (PET) studies have suggested that dopaminergic functioning and metabolic changes are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Yet, the relationship between dopaminergic or cerebral metabolism and different cognitive domains in PD is poorly understood. To address this scarcity, we aimed to investigate the interactions among dopaminergic bindings, metabolic network changes, and the cognitive domains in PD patients.</p>Methods<p>We recruited 41 PD patients, including PD patients with no cognitive impairment (PD-NC; n = 21) and those with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 20). All patients underwent clinical evaluations and a schedule of neuropsychological tests and underwent both 11C-N-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (11C-CFT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging.</p>Results<p>11C-CFT imaging revealed a significant positive correlation between executive function and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding at both the voxel and regional levels. Metabolic imaging revealed that executive function correlated with 18F-FDG uptake, mainly in inferior frontal gyrus, putamen, and insula. Further analysis indicated that striatal DAT binding correlated strictly with metabolic activity in the temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings might promote the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in PD.</p>

Background<p>It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults.</p>Methods<p>This clinical trial was registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures.</p>Results<p>Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life and dual-task performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction in dual-task performance.</p>Conclusion<p>We suggest that the dual-task combination of multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on healthy older adults.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials: https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-9zrx3d -UTN code: U1111-1233-6349.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65389">Structural basis of Stu2 recruitment to yeast kinetochores</a></h4>

Chromosome segregation during cell division requires engagement of kinetochores of sister chromatids with microtubules emanating from opposite poles. As the corresponding microtubules shorten, these 'bioriented' sister kinetochores experience tension-dependent stabilization of microtubule attachments. The yeast XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, associates with kinetochores and contributes to tension-dependent stabilization in vitro. We show here that a C-terminal segment of Stu2 binds the four-way junction of the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) and that residues conserved both in yeast Stu2 orthologs and in their metazoan counterparts make specific contacts with Ndc80 and Spc24. Mutations that perturb this interaction prevent association of Stu2 with kinetochores, impair cell viability, produce biorientation defects, and delay cell cycle progression. Ectopic tethering of the mutant Stu2 species to the Ndc80c junction restores wild-type function in vivo. These findings show that the role of Stu2 in tension-sensing depends on its association with kinetochores by binding with Ndc80c.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64693">Early postnatal interactions between beige adipocytes and sympathetic neurites regulate innervation of subcutaneous fat</a></h4>

While beige adipocytes have been found to associate with dense sympathetic neurites in mouse inguinal subcutaneous white fat (iWAT), little is known about when and how this patterning is established. Here, we applied whole-tissue imaging to examine the development of sympathetic innervation in iWAT. We found that parenchymal neurites actively grow between postnatal day 6 (P6) and P28, overlapping with early postnatal beige adipogenesis. Constitutive deletion of <i>Prdm16</i> in adipocytes led to a significant reduction in early postnatal beige adipocytes and sympathetic density within this window. Using an inducible, adipocyte-specific <i>Prdm16</i> knockout model, we found that <i>Prdm16</i> is required for guiding sympathetic growth during early development. Deleting <i>Prdm16</i> in adult animals, however, did not affect sympathetic structure in iWAT. Together, these findings highlight that beige adipocyte-sympathetic neurite communication is crucial to establish sympathetic structure during the early postnatal period but may be dispensable for its maintenance in mature animals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64690">Mitochondrial copper and phosphate transporter specificity was defined early in the evolution of eukaryotes</a></h4>

The mitochondrial carrier family protein SLC25A3 transports both copper and phosphate in mammals yet in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the transport of these substrates is partitioned across two paralogs: PIC2 and MIR1. To understand the ancestral state of copper and phosphate transport in mitochondria, we explored the evolutionary relationships of PIC2 and MIR1 orthologs across the eukaryotic tree of life. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that PIC2-like and MIR1-like orthologs are present in all major eukaryotic supergroups, indicating an ancient gene duplication created these paralogs. To link this phylogenetic signal to protein function, we used structural modelling and site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues involved in copper and phosphate transport. Based on these analyses, we generated a L175A variant of mouse SLC25A3 that retains the ability to transport copper but not phosphate. This work highlights the utility of using an evolutionary framework to uncover amino acids involved in substrate recognition by mitochondrial carrier family proteins.

Protein interaction networks are crucial for complex cellular processes. However, the elucidation of protein interactions occurring within highly specialised cells and tissues is challenging. Here we describe the development, and application, of a new method for proximity-dependent biotin labelling in whole zebrafish. Using a conditionally stabilised GFP-binding nanobody to target a biotin ligase to GFP-labelled proteins of interest, we show tissue-specific proteomic profiling using existing GFP-tagged transgenic zebrafish lines. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach, termed BLITZ (Biotin Labelling In Tagged Zebrafish), in diverse cell types such as neurons and vascular endothelial cells. We applied this methodology to identify interactors of caveolar coat protein, cavins, in skeletal muscle. Using this system, we defined specific interaction networks within <i>in vivo </i>muscle cells for the closely related but functionally distinct Cavin4 and Cavin1 proteins.

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are a class of widely prescribed psychotropic drugs that modulate activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), neurotransmitter-gated ion channels critical for synaptic transmission. However, the physical basis of this modulation is poorly understood. We explore the role of an important gating domain, the a<sub>1</sub>M2-M3 linker, in linkage between the BZD site and pore gate. To probe energetics of this coupling without complication from bound agonist we use a gain of function mutant (a<sub>1</sub>L9'Tb<sub>2</sub>g<sub>2L</sub>) directly activated by BZDs. We identify a specific residue whose mutation (a<sub>1</sub>V279A) more than doubles the energetic contribution of the BZD positive modulator diazepam (DZ) to pore opening and also enhances DZ-potentiation of GABA-evoked currents in a wild-type background. In contrast, other linker mutations have little effect on DZ efficiency, but generally impair unliganded pore opening. Our observations reveal an important residue regulating BZD-pore linkage, thereby shedding new light on the molecular mechanism of these drugs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64139">Antimicrobial resistance and COVID-19: Intersections and implications</a></h4>

Before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was among the top priorities for global public health. Already a complex challenge, AMR now needs to be addressed in a changing healthcare landscape. Here, we analyse how changes due to COVID-19 in terms of antimicrobial usage, infection prevention, and health systems affect the emergence, transmission, and burden of AMR. Increased hand hygiene, decreased international travel, and decreased elective hospital procedures may reduce AMR pathogen selection and spread in the short term. However, the opposite effects may be seen if antibiotics are more widely used as standard healthcare pathways break down. Over 6 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of AMR remain uncertain. We call for the AMR community to keep a global perspective while designing finely tuned surveillance and research to continue to improve our preparedness and response to these intersecting public health challenges.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63204">Individual variation in Achilles tendon morphology and geometry changes susceptibility to injury</a></h4>

The unique structure of the Achilles tendon, combining three smaller sub-tendons, enhances movement efficiency by allowing individual control from connected muscles. This requires compliant interfaces between sub-tendons, but compliance decreases with age and may account for increased injury frequency. Current understanding of sub-tendon sliding and its role in the whole Achilles tendon function is limited. Here we show changing the degree of sliding greatly affects the tendon mechanical behaviour. Our in vitro testing discovered distinct sub-tendon mechanical properties in keeping with their mechanical demands. In silico study based on measured properties, subject-specific tendon geometry, and modified sliding capacity demonstrated age-related displacement reduction similar to our in vivo ultrasonography measurements. Peak stress magnitude and distribution within the whole Achilles tendon are affected by individual tendon geometries, the sliding capacity between sub-tendons, and different muscle loading conditions. These results suggest clinical possibilities to identify patients at risk and design personalised rehabilitation protocols.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61803">A paucigranulocytic asthma host environment promotes the emergence of virulent influenza viral variants</a></h4>

Influenza virus has a high mutation rate, such that within one host different viral variants can emerge. Evidence suggests that influenza virus variants are more prevalent in pregnant and/or obese individuals due to their impaired interferon response. We have recently shown that the non-allergic, paucigranulocytic subtype of asthma is associated with impaired type I interferon production. Here, we seek to address if this is associated with an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Compared to controls, mice with paucigranulocytic asthma had increased disease severity and an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Specifically, PB1 mutations exclusively detected in asthmatic mice were associated with increased polymerase activity. Furthermore, asthmatic host-derived virus led to increased disease severity in wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that at least a subset of patients with asthma may be more susceptible to severe influenza and may be a possible source of new influenza virus variants.

Painful stimuli evoke a mixture of sensations, negative emotions and behaviors. These myriad effects are thought to be produced by parallel ascending circuits working in combination. Here we describe a pathway from spinal cord to brain for ongoing pain. Activation of a subset of spinal neurons expressing Tacr1 evokes a full repertoire of somatotopically-directed pain-related behaviors in the absence of noxious input. Tacr1 projection neurons (expressing NKR1) target a tiny cluster of neurons in the superior lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN-SL). We showed that these neurons, which also express Tacr1 (PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup>), are responsive to sustained but not acute noxious stimuli. Activation of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons alone did not trigger pain responses but instead served to dramatically heighten nocifensive behaviors and suppress itch. Remarkably, mice with silenced PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons ignored long-lasting noxious stimuli. Together, these data reveal new details about this spinoparabrachial pathway and its key role in the sensation of ongoing pain.

Iron is a biochemically critical metal cofactor in enzymes involved in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, nitrate assimilation, nitrogen fixation, and reactive oxygen species defense. Marine microeukaryotes have evolved a phytotransferrin-based iron uptake system to cope with iron scarcity, a major factor limiting primary productivity in the global ocean. Diatom phytotransferrin is endocytosed, however proteins downstream of this environmentally ubiquitous iron receptor are unknown. We applied engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX2-based subcellular proteomics to catalog proximal proteins of phytotransferrin in the model marine diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Proteins encoded by poorly characterized iron-sensitive genes were identified including three that are expressed from a chromosomal gene cluster. Two of them showed unambiguous colocalization with phytotransferrin adjacent to the chloroplast. Further phylogenetic, domain, and biochemical analyses suggest their involvement in intracellular iron processing. Proximity proteomics holds enormous potential to glean new insights into iron acquisition pathways and beyond in these evolutionarily, ecologically, and biotechnologically important microalgae.

Predictive coding represents a promising framework for understanding brain function. It postulates that the brain continuously inhibits predictable sensory input, ensuring a preferential processing of surprising elements. A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge as a consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input. Moving beyond the view of purely top-down driven predictions, we demonstrate via virtual lesioning experiments that networks perform predictions on two timescales: fast lateral predictions among sensory units, and slower prediction cycles that integrate evidence over time.

Cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) are usually regarded as a uniform cell type that collectively expands the coding space of the cerebellum by integrating diverse combinations of mossy fiber inputs. Accordingly, stable molecularly or physiologically defined GrC subtypes within a single cerebellar region have not been reported. The only known cellular properties that distinguishes otherwise homogeneous GrCs is the correspondence between GrC birthtime and the depth of the molecular layer to which their axons (parallel fibers) project. To determine the role birth timing plays in GrC wiring and function, we developed genetic strategies to access early- and late-born GrCs. We initiated retrograde monosynaptic rabies virus tracing from control, early-born, and late-born GrCs, revealing the different patterns of mossy fiber input to GrCs in vermis lobule 6 and simplex, as well as to early- and late-born GrCs of vermis lobule 6: sensory and motor nuclei provide more input to early-born GrCs, while basal pontine and cerebellar nuclei provide more input to late-born GrCs. In vivo multi-depth 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of parallel fibers of early- and late-born GrCs revealed representations of diverse task variables and stimuli by both populations, with differences in the proportions of parallel fibers encoding movement, reward anticipation, and reward consumption. Our results suggest neither organized parallel processing nor completely random organization of mossy fiber--&gt;GrC circuitry, but instead a moderate influence of birth timing on GrC wiring and encoding. Our imaging data also suggest that GrCs can represent general aversiveness, in addition to recently described reward representations.

The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region of human inferotemporal cortex that emerges at a fixed location in occipitotemporal cortex during reading acquisition, and systematically responds to written words in literate individuals. According to the neuronal recycling hypothesis, this region arises through the repurposing, for letter recognition, of a subpart of the ventral visual pathway initially involved in face and object recognition. Furthermore, according to the biased connectivity hypothesis, its universal localization is due to pre-existing connections from this subregion to areas involved in spoken language processing. Here, we evaluate those hypotheses in an explicit computational model. We trained a deep convolutional neural network of the ventral visual pathway, first to categorize pictures, and then to recognize written words invariantly for case, font and size. We show that the model can account for many properties of the VWFA, particularly when a subset of units possesses a biased connectivity to word output units. The network develops a sparse, invariant representation of written words, based on a restricted set of reading-selective units. Their activation mimics several properties of the VWFA, and their lesioning causes a reading-specific deficit. Our simulation fleshes out the neuronal recycling hypothesis, and make several testable predictions concerning the neural code for written words.

The thalamus is a phylogenetically well-preserved structure. Known to densely contact cortical regions, its role in the transmission of sensory information to the striatal complex has been widely reconsidered in recent years. The parafascicular of the thalamus (Pf) has been implicated the orientation of attention towards salient sensory stimuli. In a stimulus-driven reward seeking task, we sought to characterize the electrophysiological activity of Pf neurons in rats. We observed a predominance of excitatory responses over inhibitory responses for all events of the task. Neurons responded more strongly to the stimulus compared to lever-pressing and collecting reward, confirming the strong involvement of the Pf in sensory information processing. The use of long sessions allowed us to compare neuronal responses to stimuli when the animal engaged in action or when it did not. We distinguished two populations of neurons responding in an opposite way: MOTIV+ neurons responded more intensively to stimuli followed by a behavioral response than those that did not. Conversely, MOTIV-neurons responded more strongly when the stimulus was ignored by the animal. In addition, MOTIV-neurons excitations appeared at a shorter latency after the stimulus than MOTIV+ neurons. Through this encoding, Pf could perform an early selection of environmental stimuli transmitted to the striatum according to motivational level.

Ongoing neural activity, which represents internal brain states, is constantly modulated by the sensory information that is generated by the environment. In this study, we show that the habenular circuits act as a major brain hub integrating the structured ongoing activity of the limbic forebrain circuitry and the olfactory information. We demonstrate that ancestral homologs of amygdala and hippocampus in zebrafish forebrain are the major drivers of ongoing habenular activity. We also reveal that odor stimuli can modulate the activity of specific habenular neurons that are driven by this forebrain circuitry. Our results highlight a major role for the olfactory system in regulating the ongoing activity of the habenula and the forebrain, thereby altering brains internal states.

Successful extinction of traumatic memories depends on neuronal plasticity in the fear extinction network. However, the mechanisms involved in the extinction process remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the fear extinction network by using a new optogenetic technique that allows temporal and spatial control of neuronal plasticity in vivo. We optimized an optically inducible TrkB (CKII-optoTrkB), the receptor of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which can be activated upon blue light exposure to increase plasticity specifically in pyramidal neurons. The activation of CKII-optoTrkB facilitated the induction of LTP in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses after brief theta-burst stimulation and increased the expression of FosB in the pyramidal neurons of the ventral hippocampus, indicating enhanced plasticity in that brain area. We showed that optical stimulation of the CA1 region of the ventral hippocampus during fear extinction training led to an attenuated conditioned fear memory. This was a specific effect only observed when combining extinction training with CKII-optoTrkB activation, and not when using either intervention alone. Thus, TrkB activation in ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons promotes a state of neuronal plasticity that allows extinction training to guide neuronal network remodeling to overcome fear memories. Our methodology is a powerful tool to induce neuronal network remodeling in the adult brain, and can attenuate neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by malfunctioning networks.

Daily life is full of situations where many people converse at the same time. Under these noisy circumstances, individuals can employ different listening strategies to deal with the abundance of sounds around them. In this fMRI study we investigated how applying two different listening strategies - Selective vs. Distributed attention - affects the pattern of neural activity. Specifically, in a simulated  cocktail party paradigm, we compared brain activation patterns when listeners attend selectively to only one speaker and ignore all others, versus when they distribute their attention and attempt to follow two or four speakers at the same time. Results indicate that the two attention types activate a highly overlapping, bilateral fronto-temporal-parietal network of functionally connected regions. This network includes auditory association cortex (bilateral STG/STS) and higher-level regions related to speech processing and attention (bilateral IFG/insula, right MFG, left IPS). Within this network, responses in specific areas were modulated by the type of attention required. Specifically, auditory and speech-processing regions exhibited higher activity during Distributed attention, whereas fronto-parietal regions were activated more strongly during Selective attention. This pattern suggests that a common perceptual-attentional network is engaged when dealing with competing speech-inputs, regardless of the specific task at hand. At the same time, local activity within nodes of this network varies when implementing different listening strategies, reflecting the different cognitive demands they impose. These results nicely demonstrate the systems flexibility to adapt its internal computations to accommodate different task requirements and listener goals.

Significance StatementHearing many people talk simultaneously poses substantial challenges for the human perceptual and cognitive systems. We compared neural activity when listeners applied two different listening strategy to deal with these competing inputs: attending selectively to one speaker vs. distributing attention among all speakers. A network of functionally connected brain regions, involved in auditory processing, language processing and attentional control was activated when applying both attention types. However, activity within this network was modulated by the type of attention required and the number of competing speakers. These results suggest a common  attention to speech network, providing the computational infrastructure to deal effectively with multi-speaker input, but with sufficient flexibility to implement different prioritization strategies and to adapt to different listener goals.

Why do people discount future rewards? Multiple theories in psychology argue that future events are imagined less concretely than immediate events, thereby diminishing their perceived value. Here we provide neuroscientific evidence for this proposal. First, we construct a neural signature of the concreteness of prospective thought, using an fMRI dataset where the concreteness of imagined future events is orthogonal to their valence by design. Then, we apply this neural signature in two additional fMRI datasets, each using a different delay discounting task, to show that neural measures of concreteness decline as rewards are delayed farther into the future.

Significance StatementPeople tend to devalue, or discount, outcomes in the future relative to those that are more immediate. This tendency is evident in peoples difficulty in making healthy food choices or saving money for retirement. Several psychological theories propose that discounting occurs because delayed outcomes are perceived less concretely that more immediate ones. Here we build a brain decoder for the concreteness of future thought and use this unobtrusive measure to show that outcomes are processed less concretely as they occur farther into the future.

Attention is central for many aspects of cognitive performance, but there is no singular measure of a persons overall attentional functioning across tasks. To develop a universal measure that integrates multiple components of attention, we collected data from more than 90 participants performing three different attention-demanding tasks during fMRI. We constructed a suite of whole-brain models that can predict a profile of multiple attentional components - sustained attention, divided attention and tracking, and working memory capacity - from a single fMRI scan type within novel individuals. Multiple brain regions across the frontoparietal, salience, and subcortical networks drive accurate predictions, supporting a universal (general) attention factor across tasks, which can be distinguished from task-specific attention factors and their neural mechanisms. Furthermore, connectome-to-connectome transformation modeling enhanced predictions of an individuals attention-task connectomes and behavioral performance from their rest connectomes. These models were integrated to produce a new universal attention measure that generalizes best across multiple, independent datasets, and which should have broad utility for both research and clinical applications.

Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms, often with the motor dysfunction initiated unilaterally. Knowledge regarding disease-related alterations in white matter pathways can effectively help improve the understanding of the disease and propose targeted treatment strategies. Microstructural imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), allows inspection of white matter integrity to study the pathogenesis of various neurological conditions. Previous voxel-based analyses with DTI measures, such as fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity have uncovered changes in brain regions that are associated with PD, but the conclusions were inconsistent, partially due to small patient cohorts and the lack of consideration for clinical laterality onset, particularly in early PD. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) is a recent framework that offers tract-specific insights regarding white matter health, but very few FBA studies on PD exist. We present a study that reveals strengthened and weakened white matter integrity that is subject to symptom laterality in a large drug-naive de novo PD cohort using complementary DTI and FBA measures. The findings suggest that the disease gives rise to both functional degeneration and the creation of compensatory networks in the early stage.

Prioritizing memory for valuable information can promote adaptive behavior across the lifespan, but it is unclear how the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable the selective acquisition of useful knowledge develop. Here, using a novel task coupled with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how children, adolescents, and adults (N = 90) learn from experience what information is likely to be rewarding, and modulate encoding and retrieval processes accordingly. We found that the ability to use learned value signals to selectively enhance memory for useful information strengthened throughout childhood and into adolescence. Encoding and retrieval of high-vs. low-value information was associated with increased activation in striatal and prefrontal regions implicated in value processing and cognitive control. Age-related increases in value-based lateral prefrontal cortex modulation mediated the relation between age and memory selectivity. Our findings demonstrate that developmental increases in the flexible recruitment of the prefrontal cortex support the emergence of adaptive memory.

To improve future decisions, people should seek information based on the value of information (VOI), which depends on the current evidence and the reward structure of the upcoming decision. When additional evidence is supplied, people should update VOI to adjust subsequent information seeking, but the neurocognitive mechanisms of this updating process remain unknown. We used a modified beads task to examine how the VOI is represented and updated in the human brain. We theoretically derived, and empirically verified, a normative prediction that the VOI depends on decision evidence and is biased by reward asymmetry. Using fMRI, we found that the subjective VOI is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Critically, this VOI representation was updated when additional evidence was supplied, showing that DLPFC dynamically tracks the up-to-date VOI over time. These results provide new insights into how humans adaptively seek information in the service of decision making.

Current neuroimaging acquisition and processing approaches tend to be optimised for quality rather than speed. However, rapid acquisition and processing of neuroimaging data can lead to novel neuroimaging paradigms, such as adaptive acquisition, where rapidly processed data is used to inform subsequent image acquisition steps. Here we first evaluate the impact of several processing steps on the processing time and quality of registration of manually labelled T1-weighted MRI scans. Subsequently, we apply the selected rapid processing pipeline both to rapidly acquired multicontrast EPImix scans of 95 participants (which include T1-FLAIR, T2, T2*, T2-FLAIR, DWI &amp; ADC contrasts, acquired in [~]1 minute), as well as to slower, more standard single-contrast T1-weighted scans of a subset of 66 participants. We quantify the correspondence between EPImix and single-contrast T1-weighted scans, using correlations between voxels and regions of interest across participants, measures of within- and between-participant identifiability as well as regional structural covariance networks. Furthermore, we explore the use of EPImix for the rapid construction of morphometric similarity networks. Finally, we quantify the reliability of EPImix-derived data using test-retest scans of 10 participants. Our results demonstrate that quantitative information can be derived from a neuroimaging scan acquired and processed within minutes, which could further be used to implement adaptive multimodal imaging and tailor neuroimaging examinations to individual patients.

The topographical distribution of oscillatory power in the alpha band is known to vary depending on the current focus of spatial attention. Here, we investigated to what extend univariate and multivariate measures of post-stimulus alpha power are sensitive to the required spatial specificity of a task. To this end, we varied the perceptual load and the spatial demand in an auditory search paradigm. A centrally presented sound at the beginning of each trial indicated the to-be-localized target sound. This spatially unspecific pre-cue was followed by a sound array, containing either two (low perceptual load) or four (high perceptual load) simultaneously presented lateralized sound stimuli. In separate task blocks, participants were instructed either to report whether the target was located on the left or the right side of the sound array (low spatial demand) or to indicate the exact target location (high spatial demand). Univariate alpha lateralization magnitude was neither affected by perceptual load nor by spatial demand. However, an analysis of onset latencies revealed that alpha lateralization emerged earlier in low (vs. high) perceptual load trials as well as in low (vs. high) spatial demand trials. Moreover, across all conditions, participants with earlier alpha lateralization onset showed faster response times. Finally, we trained a classifier to decode the specific target location based on the multivariate alpha power scalp topography. A comparison of decoding accuracy in the low and high spatial demand conditions suggests that the amount of spatial information present in the scalp distribution of alpha-band power increases as the task demands a higher degree of spatial specificity. Altogether, the results offer new insights into how the dynamic adaption of alpha-band oscillations in response to changing task demands is associated with post-stimulus attentional processing.

The scientific and clinical value of event-related potentials (ERPs) depends on understanding the contributions to them of three possible mechanisms: (1) additivity of time-locked voltage changes; (2) phase resetting of ongoing oscillations; (3) asymmetrical oscillatory activity. Their relative contributions are currently uncertain. This study uses analysis of human electrocorticographic activity to quantify the origins of movement-related potentials (MRPs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). The results show that MRPs are generated primarily by endogenous additivity (88%). In contrast, P1 and N1 components of AEPs are generated almost entirely by exogenous phase reset (93%). Oscillatory asymmetry contributes very little. By clarifying ERP mechanisms, these results enable creation of ERP models; and they enhance the value of ERPs for understanding the genesis of normal and abnormal auditory or sensorimotor behaviors.

BackgroundOzone (O3), one of the main photochemical pollutants in the atmosphere today, is a serious health risk factor. Although the effects of O3 exposure have been documented on many diseases, they have not yet been examined on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)- a fatal progressive and neurodegenerative disease.

ObjectivesTo investigate the effect of the O3 exposure in a mice model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, exploring a possible association between the O3 exposure and the ALS pathogenesis.

MethodsTDP-43A315T and wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to O3 (0.25 ppm) or filtered air (FA) for 15 days (4 hours/day). We assessed (1) weight loss (2) motor performance (3) plasma glucose content and (4) metabolic markers from plasma samples of the animals.

ResultsThroughout the experiment, we observed a progressive decline in body weight and the motor coordination in TDP-43A315T mice compared to WT controls. Although there was a trend, there were no significant differences in the decline of body weight of TDP-43A315T mice when exposed to either FA or O3. In O3-TDP-43A315T mice, the disease duration lasted longer. In addition, O3-TDP-43A315T mice showed improvements in motor performance as well TDP-43A315T mice were hypoglycemic compared to WT mice. However, FA-TDP-43A315T mice showed lower plasma glucose levels at the disease end-stage. We found altered levels of adipokines and metabolic proteins in TDP-43A315T mice compared to WT controls. A positive correlation was found among GIP and glucagon compared to insulin concentrations in control mice. Interestingly, resistin, Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP), Glucagon Like Peptide 1 (GIP-1) and insulin levels were higher in O3-TDP-43A315T mice.

DiscussionWe provide new evidence about a mechanistic link between O3 exposure and the improvement of the metabolic disturbances present in TDP-43A315T mice. Further studies are needed to corroborate the obtained results as they warrant to understanding the underlying mechanisms.

Deposition of amyloid beta plaques in adult rat or human brain is associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines by associated glial cells that are responsible for degeneration of the diseased tissue. The expression of these cytokines is usually under check and is controlled at post-transcriptional level via several microRNAs. Computational analysis of gene expression profiles of cortical regions of Alzheimers disease patients brain suggests ineffective target cytokine mRNA suppression by existing microRNPs in diseased brain. Exploring the mechanism of amyloid beta induced cytokine expression, we have identified how the inactivation of the repressive miR-146 microRNPs causes increased production of cytokines in amyloid beta exposed glial cells. In exploration of the cause of miRNP inactivation, we have noted amyloid beta oligomer induced sequestration of mTORC1 complex to early endosomes that results in decreased Ago2 phosphorylation, limited Ago2-miRNA uncoupling and retarded Ago2-cytokine mRNA interaction in rat astrocyte cells. Interestingly, constitutive activation of mTORC1 by Rheb activator restricts proinflammatory cytokine production by reactivating miR-146 microRNPs in amyloid beta exposed glial cells to rescue the disease phenotype in the in vivo rat model of Alzheimers disease.

<p>Understanding the great empirical success of artificial neural networks (NNs)
from a theoretical point of view is currently one of the hottest research
topics in computer science. In this paper we study the expressive power of NNs
with rectified linear units from a combinatorial optimization perspective. In
particular, we show that, given a directed graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs,
there exists an NN of polynomial size that computes a maximum flow from any
possible real-valued arc capacities as input. To prove this, we develop the
pseudo-code language Max-Affine Arithmetic Programs (MAAPs) and show
equivalence between MAAPs and NNs concerning natural complexity measures. We
then design a MAAP to exactly solve the Maximum Flow Problem, which translates
to an NN of size $\mathcal{O}(m^2 n^2)$.

<p>Typical systems neuroscience experiments correlate the activity of recorded
neurons with controlled variations in stimuli or behavior. Such experiments are
commonly taken to reveal that the neural activity is a representation of the
stimulus or behavior. But what does this statement mean? Representation is a
philosophical concept with a rich history going back at least to Aristotle. A
careful reading of contemporary philosophy suggests four criteria of
representation as they relate to neuroscience. First, a representation needs to
correlate with the object in reality that it represents. Second, a
representation needs to have some causal impact on behavior. Third, a
representation should have its causal role exclusively -- the absence of the
representation should block the behavior it enables. Fourth, a representation
should have teleological justification that specifies the cases in which it is
a misrepresentation. We argue that not taking all four criteria seriously leads
to statements that are neither neuroscientifically nor philosophically
satisfying. We discuss how neuroscience can move towards a deeper notion of
representation.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06481">Leveraging Benchmarking Data for Informed One-Shot Dynamic Algorithm Selection. (arXiv:2102.06481v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>A key challenge in the application of evolutionary algorithms in practice is
the selection of an algorithm instance that best suits the problem at hand.
What complicates this decision further is that different algorithms may be best
suited for different stages of the optimization process. Dynamic algorithm
selection and configuration are therefore well-researched topics in
evolutionary computation. However, while hyper-heuristics and parameter control
studies typically assume a setting in which the algorithm needs to be chosen
while running the algorithms, without prior information, AutoML approaches such
as hyper-parameter tuning and automated algorithm configuration assume the
possibility of evaluating different configurations before making a final
recommendation. In practice, however, we are often in a middle-ground between
these two settings, where we need to decide on the algorithm instance before
the run ("oneshot" setting), but where we have (possibly lots of) data
available on which we can base an informed decision.
</p>
<p>We analyze in this work how such prior performance data can be used to infer
informed dynamic algorithm selection schemes for the solution of pseudo-Boolean
optimization problems. Our specific use-case considers a family of genetic
algorithms.

<p>We present a first proof-of-concept use-case that demonstrates the efficiency
of interfacing the algorithm framework ParadisEO with the automated algorithm
configuration tool irace and the experimental platform IOHprofiler. By combing
these three tools, we obtain a powerful benchmarking environment that allows us
to systematically analyze large classes of algorithm spaces on complex
benchmark problems. Key advantages of our pipeline are fast evaluation times,
the possibility to generate rich data sets to support the analysis of the
algorithms, and a standardized interface that can be used to benchmark very
broad classes of sampling-based optimization heuristics.
</p>
<p>In addition to enabling systematic algorithm configuration studies, our
approach paves a way for assessing the contribution of new ideas in interplay
with already existing operators -- a promising avenue for our research domain,
which at present may have a too strong focus on comparing entire algorithm
instances.

<p>We present a new model of neural networks called Min-Max-Plus Neural Networks
(MMP-NNs) based on operations in tropical arithmetic. In general, an MMP-NN is
composed of three types of alternately stacked layers, namely linear layers,
min-plus layers and max-plus layers. Specifically, the latter two types of
layers constitute the nonlinear part of the network which is trainable and more
sophisticated compared to the nonlinear part of conventional neural networks.
In addition, we show that with higher capability of nonlinearity expression,
MMP-NNs are universal approximators of continuous functions, even when the
number of multiplication operations is tremendously reduced (possibly to none
in certain extreme cases). Furthermore, we formulate the backpropagation
algorithm in the training process of MMP-NNs and introduce an algorithm of
normalization to improve the rate of convergence in training.

<p>Darwinian evolution tends to produce energy-efficient outcomes. On the other
hand, energy limits computation, be it neural and probabilistic or digital and
logical. Taking a particular energy-efficient viewpoint, we define neural
computation and make use of an energy-constrained, computational function. This
function can be optimized over a variable that is proportional to the number of
synapses per neuron. This function also implies a specific distinction between
ATP-consuming processes, especially computation \textit{per se} vs the
communication processes including action potentials and transmitter release.
Thus to apply this mathematical function requires an energy audit with a
partitioning of energy consumption that differs from earlier work. The audit
points out that, rather than the oft-quoted 20 watts of glucose available to
the brain \cite{sokoloff1960metabolism,sawada2013synapse}, the fraction
partitioned to cortical computation is only 0.1 watts of ATP. On the other hand
at 3.5 watts, long-distance communication costs are 35-fold greater. Other
novel quantifications include (i) a finding that the biological vs ideal values
of neural computational efficiency differ by a factor of $10^8$ and (ii) two
predictions of $N$, the number of synaptic transmissions needed to fire a
neuron (2500 vs 2000).

<p>We propose a novel decentralized feature extraction approach in federated
learning to address privacy-preservation issues for speech recognition. It is
built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum
circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN)
based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in
a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum
computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding
convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with
random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN
model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes
advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid
privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the
proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a
decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using
centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We also conduct an in-depth
study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights
into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses
demonstrate a correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation
maps, and input spectrograms. We provide an implementation for future studies.

                <h4><a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00422-020-00856-4">A geometry- and muscle-based control architecture for synthesising biological movement</a></h4>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">A key problem for biological motor control is to establish a link between an idea of a movement and the generation of a set of muscle-stimulating signals that lead to the movement execution. The number of signals to generate is thereby larger than the body’s mechanical degrees of freedom in which the idea of the movement may be easily expressed, as the movement is actually executed in this space. A mathematical formulation that provides a solving link is presented in this paper in the form of a layered, hierarchical control architecture. It is meant to synthesise a wide range of complex three-dimensional muscle-driven movements. The control architecture consists of a ‘conceptional layer’, where the movement is planned, a ‘structural layer’, where the muscles are stimulated, and between both an additional ‘transformational layer’, where the muscle-joint redundancy is resolved. We demonstrate the operativeness by simulating human stance and squatting in a three-dimensional digital human model (DHM). The DHM considers 20 angular DoFs and 36 Hill-type muscle–tendon units (MTUs) and is exposed to gravity, while its feet contact the ground via reversible stick–slip interactions. The control architecture continuously stimulates all MTUs (‘structural layer’) based on a high-level, torque-based task formulation within its ‘conceptional layer’. Desired states of joint angles (postural plan) are fed to two mid-level joint controllers in the ‘transformational layer’. The ‘transformational layer’ communicates with the biophysical structures in the ‘structural layer’ by providing direct MTU stimulation contributions and further input signals for low-level MTU controllers. Thereby, the redundancy of the MTU stimulations with respect to the joint angles is resolved, i.e. a link between plan and execution is established, by exploiting some properties of the biophysical structures modelled. The resulting joint torques generated by the MTUs via their moment arms are fed back to the conceptional layer, closing the high-level control loop. Within our mathematical formulations of the Jacobian matrix-based layer transformations, we identify the crucial information for the redundancy solution to be the muscle moment arms, the stiffness relations of muscle and tendon tissue within the muscle model, and the length–stimulation relation of the muscle activation dynamics. The present control architecture allows the straightforward feeding of conceptional movement task formulations to MTUs. With this approach, the problem of movement planning is eased, as solely the mechanical system has to be considered in the conceptional plan.

Patients with test performance below − 1.5 standard deviations of the mean HCs scores were labeled as cognitive impairment. Visual ability was assessed with 100%, 2.5%, and 1.25% low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) charts. OCT-derived peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, macular volume (MV), macular ganglion cell inner plexiform (mGCIP) thickness (as a sum of GC and IP layers), and macular inner nuclear layer (mINL) were computed.</p>

<p>Historically, the mammalian brain was thought to lack stem cells as no new neurons were found to be made in adulthood. That dogma changed ∼25 years ago with the identification of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult rodent forebrain. However, unlike rapidly self-renewing mature tissues (e.g., blood, intestinal crypts, skin), the majority of adult NSCs are quiescent, and those that become ‘activated’ are restricted to a few neurogenic zones that repopulate specific brain regions. Conversely, embryonic NSCs are actively proliferating and neurogenic. Investigations into the molecular control of the quiescence-to-proliferation-to-differentiation continuum in the embryonic and adult brain have identified proneural genes encoding basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) as critical regulators. These bHLH TFs initiate genetic programs that remove NSCs from quiescence and drive daughter neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to differentiate into specific neural cell subtypes, thereby contributing to the enormous cellular diversity of the adult brain. However, new insights have revealed that proneural gene activities are context-dependent and tightly regulated. Here we review how proneural bHLH TFs are regulated, with a focus on the murine cerebral cortex, drawing parallels where appropriate to other organisms and neural tissues. We discuss upstream regulatory events, post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation), protein–protein interactions, epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms that govern bHLH TF expression, stability, localization, and consequent transactivation of downstream target genes. These tight regulatory controls help to explain paradoxical findings of changes to bHLH activity in different cellular contexts.</p>

<p>Nitration of tyrosine at the tenth residue (Tyr10) in amyloid-β (Aβ) has been reported to reduce its aggregation and neurotoxicity in our previous studies. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here, we used Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> peptide with differently modified forms at Tyr10 to investigate the molecular mechanism to fill this gap. By using immunofluorescent assay, we confirmed that nitrated Aβ was found in the cortex of 10-month-old female triple transgenic mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). And then, we used the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method and circular dichroism (CD) to demonstrate that the modification and mutation of Tyr10 in Aβ have little impact on conformational changes. Then, with the aids of fluorescence assays of thioflavin T and 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), we found that adding a large group to the phenolic ring of Tyr10 of Aβ could not inhibit Aβ fibrilization and aggregation. Nitration of Aβ reduces its aggregation mainly because it could induce the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr10 of Aβ at physiological pH. We proposed that the negatively charged Tyr10 caused by nitration at physiological pH could interact with the salt bridge between Glu11 and His6 or His13 and block the kink around Tyr10, thereby preventing Aβ fibrilization and aggregation. These findings provide us new insights into the relationship between Tyr10 nitration and Aβ aggregation, which would help to further understand that keeping the balance of nitric oxide in vivo is important for preventing AD.</p>

<p>Anxious major depressive disorder is a common subtype of major depressive disorder; however, its unique neural mechanism is not well-understood currently. Using multimodal MRI data, this study examined common and specific alterations of amygdala subregions between patients with and without anxiety. No alterations were observed in the gray matter volume or intra-region functional integration in either patient group. Compared with the controls, both patient groups showed decreased functional connectivity between the left superficial amygdala and the left putamen, and between the right superficial amygdala and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, while only patients with anxiety exhibited decreased activity in the bilateral laterobasal and superficial amygdala. Moreover, the decreased activity correlated negatively with the Hamilton depression scale scores in the patients with anxiety. These findings provided insights into the pathophysiologic processes of anxious major depressive disorder and may help to develop new and effective treatment programs.</p>

<p>Motion-sound synesthesia is characterized by illusory auditory sensations linked to the pattern and rhythms of motion (dubbed “Mickey Mousing” as in cinema) of visually experienced but soundless object, like an optical flow array, a ball bouncing or a horse galloping. In an MRI study with a group of three synesthetes and a group of eighteen control participants, we found structural changes in the brains of synesthetes in the subcortical multisensory areas of the superior and inferior colliculi. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed activity in motion-sensitive regions, as well as temporal and occipital areas, and the cerebellum. However, the synesthetes had a higher activation within the left and right cuneus, with stronger activations when viewing optical flow stimuli. There was also a general difference in connectivity of the colliculi with the above mentioned regions between the two groups. These findings implicate low-level mechanisms within the human neuroaxis as a substrate for local connectivity and cross activity between perceptual processes that are “distant” in terms of cortical topography. The present findings underline the importance of considering the role of subcortical systems and their connectivity to multimodal regions of the cortex and they strengthen a parsimonious account of synesthesia, at the least of the visual-auditory type.</p>

<p>Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) after surgery is a common postoperative complication in older adult patients. Our previous studies have demonstrated that cognitive impairment after surgery involves an increase in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, including overactivation of the angiotensin 2/angiotensin receptor-1 (Ang II/AT1) axis, which provokes the disruption of the hippocampal blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nevertheless, the potential role of the counter-regulatory RAS axis, the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway, in dNCR remains unknown. Using an aged rat model of dNCR, we dynamically investigated the activity of both axes of the RAS following laparotomy. AVE 0991, a nonpeptide analog of Ang-(1–7), was administered intranasally immediately after laparotomy. We found that the elevation of Ang II, induced by surgery was accompanied by a decrease of Ang-(1–7) in the hippocampus, but not in the circulation. Surgery also significantly downregulated hippocampal Mas receptor expression at 24 h postsurgery. Mas activation with intranasal AVE 0991 treatment significantly improved hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits induced by surgery. Furthermore, it attenuated hippocampal neuroinflammation, as shown by the decreased level of the microglial activation marker cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) and the decreased production of several inflammatory molecules. Along with these beneficial effects, the AVE 0991 treatment also alleviated the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), modulated the expression of occludin, and alleviated the IgG extravasation, thereby restoring the integrity of the BBB. In conclusion, these data indicate that activation of Mas by AVE 0991 attenuates dNCR after surgery by reducing neuroinflammation and restoring BBB integrity. Our findings suggest that the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for treating dNCR after surgery in older adult patients.</p>

<p>Working memory training (WMT) effects may be modulated by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes, and variations in APOE-epsilon (APOE-ε) and LMX1A genotypes. Sixty-one individuals (41 men/20 women, mean age 66 years) diagnosed with MCI (31 amnestic/30 non-amnestic) and genotyped for APOE-ε and LMX1A completed 4 weeks/20–25 sessions of WMT. Cognitive functions were assessed before, 4 weeks and 16 weeks after WMT. Except for Processing Speed, the non-amnestic MCI group (naMCI) outperformed the amnestic MCI (aMCI) group in all cognitive domains across all time-points. At 4 weeks, working memory function improved in both groups (p &lt; 0.0001), but at 16 weeks the effects only remained in the naMCI group. Better performance was found after training for the naMCI patients with LMX1A-AA genotype and for the APOE-ε4 carriers. Only the naMCI-APOE-ε4 group showed improved Executive Function at 16 weeks. WMT improved working memory and some non-trained cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. The naMCI group had greater training gain than aMCI group, especially in those with LMX1A-AA genotype and among APOE-ε4-carriers. Further research with larger sample sizes for the subgroups and longer follow-up evaluations is warranted.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.596025">Basal Forebrain Atrophy Is Associated With Allocentric Navigation Deficits in Subjective Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

<p>Individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are at higher risk of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Spatial navigation (SN) impairments in AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment patients have been well-documented; however, studies investigating SN deficits in SCD subjects are still lacking. This study aimed to explore whether basal forebrain (BF) and entorhinal cortex (EC) atrophy contribute to spatial disorientation in the SCD stage. In total, 31 SCD subjects and 24 normal controls were enrolled and administered cognitive scales, a 2-dimensional computerized SN test, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. We computed the differences in navigation distance errors and volumes of BF subfields, EC, and hippocampus between the SCD and control groups. The correlations between MRI volumetry and navigation distance errors were also calculated. Compared with the controls, the SCD subjects performed worse in both egocentric and allocentric navigation. The SCD group showed volume reductions in the whole BF (p &lt; 0.05, uncorrected) and the Ch4p subfield (p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), but comparable EC and hippocampal volumes with the controls. In the SCD cohort, the allocentric errors were negatively correlated with total BF (r = −0.625, p &lt; 0.001), Ch4p (r = −0.625, p &lt; 0.001), total EC (r = −0.423, p = 0.031), and left EC volumes (r = −0.442, p = 0.024), adjusting for age, gender, years of education, total intracranial volume, and hippocampal volume. This study demonstrates that SN deficits and BF atrophy may be promising indicators for the early detection of incipient AD patients. The reduced BF volume, especially in the Ch4p subfield, may serve as a structural basis for allocentric disorientation in SCD subjects independent of hippocampal atrophy. Our findings may have further implications for the preclinical diagnosis and intervention for potential AD patients.</p>

<p>Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise has been shown to improve cognitive task-switching performance in older adults, but the extent of this positive effect varies among individuals. Past research also shows that brain white matter integrity could predict behavioral gains of cognitive and motor learning. Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial (NCT02270320), we examined whether baseline integrity of three target white matter tract groups was predictive of task-switching improvement after 12-week TCC training in middle-aged and older adults. Thirty-eight eligible participants were randomly assigned to a TCC group (n = 19) and a control group (n = 19). Cognitive task-switching and physical performances were collected before and after training. Brain diffusion spectrum MR images were acquired before training and the general fractional anisotropy (GFA) of each target white matter tract group was calculated to indicate baseline white matter integrity of that group. Correlation and regression analyses between these GFAs and post-training task-switching improvement were analyzed using adjusted p-values. After 12 weeks, significant task-switching and physical performance improvements were found only in the TCC group. Moreover, higher baseline GFA of the prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal loop fibers (r = −0.63, p = 0.009), but not of the prefronto-parietal/occipital (r = −0.55, p = 0.026) and callosal (r = −0.35, p = 0.189) fiber groups, was associated with greater reductions of task-switching errors after the TCC training. Multiple regression analysis revealed that baseline GFA of the prefronto-striato-thalamo-prefrontal loop fibers was the only independent white matter integrity predictor of task-switching error reductions after TCC training (β = −0.620, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.265, p = 0.009). These findings not only highlight the important role of baseline integrity of the prefronto-striatal circuits in influencing the extent of positive cognitive task-switching effects from short-term TCC training, but also implicate that preserving good white matter integrity in the aging process may be crucial in order to gain the best cognitive effects of exercise interventions.</p>

The canonical Wnt pathway transcriptional co-activator β-catenin regulates self-renewal and differentiation of mammalian nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). We modulated β-catenin levels in NPC cultures using the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR9902 (CHIR) to examine opposing developmental actions of β-catenin. Low CHIR-mediated maintenance and expansion of NPCs is independent of direct engagement of TCF/LEF/β-catenin transcriptional complexes at low CHIR-dependent cell-cycle targets. In contrast, in high CHIR, TCF7/LEF1/β-catenin complexes replaced TCF7L1/TCF7L2 binding on enhancers of differentiation-promoting target genes. Chromosome confirmation studies showed pre-established promoter-enhancer connections to these target genes in NPCs. High CHIR-associated <i>de novo</i> looping was observed in positive transcriptional feedback regulation to the canonical Wnt pathway. Thus, β-catenin's direct transcriptional role is restricted to the induction of NPCs where rising β-catenin levels switch inhibitory TCF7L1/TCF7L2 complexes to activating LEF1/TCF7 complexes at primed gene targets poised for rapid initiation of a nephrogenic program.

Communications between actin filaments and integrin-mediated focal adhesion (FA) are crucial for cell adhesion and migration. As a core platform to organize FA proteins, the tripartite ILK/PINCH/Parvin (IPP) complex interacts with actin filaments to regulate the cytoskeleton-FA crosstalk. Rsu1, a Ras suppressor, is enriched in FA through PINCH1 and plays important roles in regulating F-actin structures. Here, we solved crystal structures of the Rsu1/PINCH1 complex, in which the Leucine-Rich-Repeats of Rsu1 form a solenoid structure to tightly associate with the C-terminal region of PINCH1. Further structural analysis uncovered that the interaction between Rsu1 and PINCH1 blocks the IPP-mediated F-actin bundling by disrupting the binding of PINCH1 to actin. Consistently, overexpressing Rsu1 in HeLa cells impairs stress fiber formation and cell spreading. Together, our findings demonstrated that Rsu1 is critical for tuning the communication between F-actin and FA by interacting with the IPP complex and negatively modulating the F-actin bundling.

In a traditional view, in social cognition, attention is equated with gaze and people track other people’s attention by tracking their gaze. Here, we used fMRI to test whether the brain represents attention in a richer manner. People read stories describing an agent (either oneself or someone else) directing attention to an object in one of two ways: either internally directed (endogenous) or externally induced (exogenous). We used multivoxel pattern analysis to examine how brain areas within the theory-of-mind network encoded attention type and agent type. Brain activity patterns in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) showed significant decoding of information about endogenous versus exogenous attention. The left TPJ, left superior temporal sulcus (STS), precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) significantly decoded agent type (self versus other). These findings show that the brain constructs a rich model of one’s own and others’ attentional state, possibly aiding theory of mind.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61951">α-Synuclein plasma membrane localization correlates with cellular phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate levels</a></h4>

The Parkinson's disease protein α-synuclein (aSyn) promotes membrane fusion and fission by interacting with various negatively charged phospholipids. Despite postulated roles in endocytosis and exocytosis, plasma membrane (PM) interactions of αSyn are poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), two highly acidic components of inner PM leaflets, mediate plasma membrane localization of endogenous pools of αSyn in A2780, HeLa, SK-MEL-2 and differentiated and undifferentiated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. We demonstrate that αSyn binds to reconstituted PIP<sub>2</sub>-membranes in a helical conformation <i>in vitro</i> and that PIP<sub>2 </sub>synthesizing<sub> </sub>kinases and hydrolyzing phosphatases reversibly redistribute αSyn in cells. We further delineate that αSyn-PM targeting follows phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent changes of cellular PIP<sub>2</sub> and PIP<sub>3</sub> levels, which collectively suggests that phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates contribute to αSyn's cellular function(s) at the plasma membrane.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61940">Phasic oxygen dynamics confounds fast choline-sensitive biosensor signals in the brain of behaving rodents</a></h4>

Cholinergic fast time-scale modulation of cortical physiology is critical for cognition, but direct local measurement of neuromodulators <i>in vivo </i>is challenging. Choline oxidase (ChOx)-based electrochemical biosensors have been used to capture fast cholinergic signals in behaving animals. However, these transients might be biased by local field potential and O<sub>2</sub>-evoked enzymatic responses. Using a novel Tetrode-based Amperometric ChOx (TACO) sensor we performed highly sensitive and selective simultaneous measurement of ChOx activity (COA) and O<sub>2</sub>. I<i>n vitro</i> and <i>in vivo </i>experiments, supported by mathematical modeling, revealed that non-steady-state enzyme responses to O<sub>2</sub> give rise to phasic COA dynamics. This mechanism accounts for most of COA transients in the hippocampus, including those following locomotion bouts and sharp-wave/ripples Our results suggest that it is unfeasible to probe phasic cholinergic signals under most behavioral paradigms with current ChOx biosensors<i>.</i> This confound is generalizable to any oxidase-based biosensor, entailing rigorous controls and new biosensor designs.

Dorsal Excitor motor neuron DE-3 in the medicinal leech plays three very different dynamical roles in three different behaviors. Without rewiring its anatomical connectivity, how can a motor neuron dynamically switch roles to play appropriate roles in various behaviors? We previously used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to record from DE-3 and most other neurons in the leech segmental ganglion during (fictive) swimming, crawling, and local-bend escape (Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017). Here, we repeated that experiment, then re-imaged the same ganglion using serial blockface electron microscopy and traced DE-3's processes. Further, we traced back the processes of DE-3's presynaptic partners to their respective somata. This allowed us to analyze the relationship between circuit anatomy and the activity patterns it sustains. We found that input synapses important for all of the behaviors were widely distributed over DE-3's branches, yet that functional clusters were different during (fictive) swimming vs. crawling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61358">From local resynchronization to global pattern recovery in the zebrafish segmentation clock</a></h4>

Integrity of rhythmic spatial gene expression patterns in the vertebrate segmentation clock requires local synchronization between neighboring cells by Delta-Notch signaling and its inhibition causes defective segment boundaries. Whether deformation of the oscillating tissue complements local synchronization during patterning and segment formation is not understood. We combine theory and experiment to investigate this question in the zebrafish segmentation clock. We remove a Notch inhibitor, allowing resynchronization, and analyze embryonic segment recovery. We observe unexpected intermingling of normal and defective segments, and capture this with a new model combining coupled oscillators and tissue mechanics. Intermingled segments are explained in the theory by advection of persistent phase vortices of oscillators. Experimentally observed changes in recovery patterns are predicted in the theory by temporal changes in tissue length and cell advection pattern. Thus, segmental pattern recovery occurs at two length and time scales: rapid local synchronization between neighboring cells, and the slower transport of the resulting patterns across the tissue through morphogenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60681">SNPC-1.3 is a sex-specific transcription factor that drives male piRNA expression in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play essential roles in silencing repetitive elements to promote fertility in metazoans. Studies in worms, flies, and mammals reveal that piRNAs are expressed in a sex-specific manner. However, the mechanisms underlying this sex-specific regulation are unknown. Here we identify SNPC-1.3, a male germline-enriched variant of a conserved subunit of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex, as a male-specific piRNA transcription factor in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. SNPC-1.3 colocalizes with the core piRNA transcription factor, SNPC-4, in nuclear foci of the male germline. Binding of SNPC-1.3 at male piRNA loci drives spermatogenic piRNA transcription and requires SNPC-4. Loss of <i>snpc-1.3</i> leads to depletion of male piRNAs and defects in male-dependent fertility. Furthermore, TRA-1, a master regulator of sex determination, binds to the <i>snpc-1.3</i> promoter and represses its expression during oogenesis. Loss of TRA-1 targeting causes ectopic expression of <i>snpc-1.3</i> and male piRNAs during oogenesis. Thus, sexually dimorphic regulation of <i>snpc-1.3</i> expression coordinates male and female piRNA expression during germline development.

Certain ciliary signaling proteins couple with the BBSome, a conserved complex of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, to load onto retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains for their removal out of cilia in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Here, we show that loss of the Arf-like 6 (ARL6) GTPase BBS3 causes the signaling protein phospholipase D (PLD) to accumulate in cilia. Upon targeting to the basal body, BBSomes enter and cycle through cilia via IFT, while BBS3 in a GTP-bound state separates from BBSomes, associates with the membrane, and translocates from the basal body to cilia by diffusion. Upon arriving at the ciliary tip, GTP-bound BBS3 binds and recruits BBSomes to the ciliary membrane for interacting with PLD, thus making the PLD-laden BBSomes available to load onto retrograde IFT trains for ciliary exit. Therefore, BBS3 promotes PLD exit from cilia via the BBSome providing a regulatory mechanism for ciliary signaling protein removal out of cilia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58615">GWAS of three molecular traits highlights core genes and pathways alongside a highly polygenic background</a></h4>

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to study the genetic basis of a wide variety of complex diseases and other traits. We describe UK Biobank GWAS results for three molecular traits—urate, IGF-1, and testosterone—with better-understood biology than most other complex traits. We find that many of the most significant hits are readily interpretable. We observe huge enrichment of associations near genes involved in the relevant biosynthesis, transport, or signaling pathways. We show how GWAS data illuminate the biology of each trait, including differences in testosterone regulation between females and males. At the same time, even these molecular traits are highly polygenic, with many thousands of variants spread across the genome contributing to trait variance. In summary, for these three molecular traits we identify strong enrichment of signal in putative core gene sets, even while most of the SNP-based heritability is driven by a massively polygenic background.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431293v1?rss=1">Mapping language and non-language cognitive deficits in post-stroke anomic aphasia</a></h4>

Background - While language impairment is the defining symptom of aphasia, the co-occurrence of non-language cognitive deficits and their importance in predicting rehabilitation and recovery outcomes is well documented. However, few studies have explored how individual cognitive domains contribute to patients' impairment and how this relates to underlying lesion pattern. A better understanding of this is essential for improving aphasia treatments. Objectives - This study aimed to explore the brain-behaviour relationships between tests of individual cognitive skill, as well as language abilities, in patients with post-stroke aphasia. We predicted our analysis would reveal a latent (non-language specific) cognitive component, which would be driven by damage to left frontal cortices. Methods - We analysed the behavioural and neural correlates of an extensive battery of language and non-language cognitive tests in a selective sample of 36 patients with post-stroke anomic aphasia, with relatively intact speech comprehension and repetition. The behavioural variables were analysed using Principle Component Analysis and their neural correlates were estimated using Voxel-Based Correlational Morphology. Results - A significant number of anomia patients showed impaired performance on tests of non-language cognitive function. The variance underlying behavioural performance was best captured by four orthogonal components, two non-language cognitive components (executive function and verbal working memory) and two previously identified language components (phonology and semantics). Brain-behaviour relationships revealed separable neural correlates for each component in line with previous studies and a novel executive function correlate in the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC). Conclusion - Our findings suggest that in patients with chronic post-stroke anomia, non-language cognitive abilities explain more of the variance in language function than classical models of the condition imply. Additionally, lesions to the LIFC, including Broca's area, were associated with executive (dys)function, independent of language abilities, suggesting that lesions to this area might be primarily driving a (non-language specific) cognitive component in anomia.

The amplitude of activation in brain resting state networks (RSNs), measured with resting-state functional MRI, is heritable and genetically correlated across RSNs, indicating pleiotropy. Recent univariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explored the genetic underpinnings of RSNs, but do not describe their pleiotropic nature. In this study, we used multivariate genomic structural equation modelling to model latent factors that capture shared genomic influences. Using summary statistics from GWAS of 21 RSNs in the UK Biobank (N = 21,081) sample, we show that their genetic organization can be best explained by two distinct but correlated genetic factors that divide multimodal association networks and sensory networks. We identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genes associated with the joint architecture of resting-state networks. We conclude that multivariate models of genetic structures can help us to learn more about the biological mechanisms involved in brain function.

Background Individual reactions to traumatic stress vary dramatically, yet the biological basis of this variation remains poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated surprising plasticity of oligodendrocytes and myelin in the adult brain, providing a potential mechanism by which aberrant structural and functional changes arise in the brain following trauma exposure. Methods We tested the hypothesis that gray matter myelin contributes to traumatic stress-induced behavioral variation. We exposed adult rats to a single, severe stressor and used a multimodal approach to characterize avoidance, startle, and fear-learning behavior. We quantified oligodendrocyte and myelin content in multiple brain areas and compared these measures to behavioral metrics. We then induced overexpression of the oligodendrogenic transcription factor Olig1 in the adult rat dentate gyrus (DG) to test the potential, causal role of oligodendrogenesis in behavioral variation. Lastly, T1-/T2-weighted estimates of myelin were compared to trauma-induced symptom profiles in humans. Results Oligodendrocytes and myelin in the DG of the hippocampus positively correlated with stress-induced avoidance behaviors in male rats. In contrast, myelin levels in the amygdala positively correlated with contextual fear learning. Olig1 overexpression increased place avoidance compared to control virus animals, indicating that increased oligodendrocyte drive in the DG is sufficient to induce an avoidance behavioral phenotype. Finally, variation in myelin correlated with trauma-induced symptom profiles in humans in a region-specific manner that mirrored our rodent findings. Conclusions These results demonstrate a species-independent relationship between region-specific, gray matter oligodendrocytes and myelin and differential behavioral phenotypes following traumatic stress exposure. This study provides a novel biological framework for understanding the mechanisms that underlie individual variance in sensitivity to traumatic stress.

Therapeutics that promote oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination are needed to restore neurological function in demyelinating diseases. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an essential lipid metabolite that signals through five G-protein coupled receptors. S1P receptor agonists such as Fingolimod are valuable immunosuppressants used to treat multiple sclerosis, and promote oligodendrocyte survival. However, the role for endogenous S1P, synthesized by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), in oligodendrocyte survival and myelination has not been established. This study investigated the requirement for SphK2 in oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination using the cuprizone mouse model of acute demyelination, followed by spontaneous remyelination. Oligodendrocyte density did not differ between untreated wild-type (WT) and SphK2 knockout (SphK2-/-) mice. However, cuprizone treatment caused significantly greater loss of mature oligodendrocytes in SphK2-/- compared to WT mice. Following cuprizone withdrawal, spontaneous remyelination occurred in WT but not SphK2-/- mice, even though progenitor and mature oligodendrocyte density increased in both genotypes. Levels of cytotoxic sphingosine and ceramide were higher in the corpus callosum of SphK2-/- mice, and in contrast to WT mice, did not decline following cuprizone withdrawal in SphK2-/- mice. We also observed a significant reduction in myelin thickness with ageing in SphK2-/- compared to WT mice. These results provide the first evidence that SphK2, the dominant enzyme catalysing S1P synthesis in the adult brain, is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult and myelin maintenance with ageing. We propose that persistently high levels of sphingosine and ceramide, a direct consequence of SphK2 deficiency, may block remyelination.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431144v1?rss=1">Short-term plasticity persists in the absence of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1</a></h4>

Post tetanic potentiation (PTP) is a form of short-term plasticity that lasts for tens of seconds following a burst of presynaptic activity. It has been proposed that PTP arises from protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Munc18-1, an SM (Sec1/Munc-18 like) family protein that is essential for release. To test this model, we made a knockin mouse in which all Munc18-1 PKC phosphorylation sites were eliminated through serine-to-alanine point mutations (Munc18-1 SA mice). Expression of Munc18-1 was not altered in Munc18-1SA mice, and there were no obvious behavioral phenotypes. At the hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapse, and the granule cell parallel fiber to Purkinje cell (PF to PC) synapse, basal transmission was largely normal except for small decreases in paired-pulse facilitation that are consistent with a slight elevation in release probability. Phorbol esters that mimic activation of PKC by diacylglycerol still increased synaptic transmission in Munc18-1 SA mice. In Munc18-1 SA mice, 70% of PTP remained at CA3 to CA1 synapses, and the amplitude of PTP was not reduced at PF to PC synapses. These findings indicate that at both CA3 to CA1 and PF to PC synapses, phorbol esters and PTP enhance synaptic transmission primarily by mechanisms that are independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18 1.

The output of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) is expressed by a train of single spikes with intermittent bursts of multiple spikes at high frequencies. The bursts are the result of nonlinear dendritic properties, including Na+, Ca2+, and NMDA spikes, that interact with the [~]10,000 synapses impinging on the neurons dendrites. Output spike bursts are thought to implement key dendritic computations, such as coincidence detection of bottom-up inputs (arriving mostly at the basal tree) and top-down inputs (arriving mostly at the apical tree). In this study we used a detailed nonlinear model of L5PC receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to explore the conditions for generating bursts and for modulating their properties. We established the excitatory input conditions on the basal versus the apical tree that favor burst and show that there are two distinct types of bursts. Bursts consisting of 3 or more spikes firing at &lt; 200 Hz, which are generated by stronger excitatory input to the basal versus the apical tree, and bursts of [~]2-spikes at [~]250 Hz, generated by prominent apical tuft excitation. Localized and well-timed dendritic inhibition on the apical tree differentially modulates Na+, Ca2+, and NMDA spikes and, consequently, finely controls the burst output. Finally, we explored the implications of different burst classes and respective dendritic inhibition for regulating synaptic plasticity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.430156v1?rss=1">Genetic influence on resting state networks in young male and female adults</a></h4>

Determining genetic versus environmental influences on the human brain is of crucial importance to understand the healthy brain as well as in a variety of disease and disorder states. Here we propose a unique, minimal assumption, approach to investigate genetic influence on the functional connectivity of the brain using 260 subjects" (65 monozygotic (MZ) and 65 dizygotic (DZ) healthy young adult twin pairs) resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). For any given resting state connection between twin pairs, the connection strengths across pairs were subtracted from each other in both directions. By applying the F-Test for equality of variances per connection, we found that there were a number of significant connections that demonstrated greater variance among dizygotic pairs in comparison to monozygotic pairs, implying these connections were under significant genetic influence. These population (DZ-MZ) results remained true irrespective of gender, with the caveat that certain connections were significant on a gender-specific basis. This is the first study to our knowledge to assess the heritability across young healthy adults both in general and specific to gender.

Population Results &amp; DiscussionAt the population level, there appears to be a posterior to anterior gradient of more to less genetic influence on brain connections and networks with visual &gt; temporal, parietal &gt; frontal. There was a high density of genetically-influenced functional connections predominantly involving posterior regions or networks of the brain: Visual Networks (VNs - primary visual, early visual, dorsal stream and ventral stream visual cortices, MT+ complex). These posterior regions of the brain with greater genetic influence are implicated for example in visual, perceptual, dorsal ("where") and ventral ("what") visuospatial processing streams (VNs).

There was a low-density or paucity of genetically-influenced functional connections predominantly involving anterior regions or networks of the brain comprising Task Positive Networks (TPNs): FrontoParietal Networks (FPNs - dorsolateral prefrontal, orbital and polar frontal, midcingulate, insular and frontal opercular, superior and inferior parietal cortices); FrontoTemporal Networks (FTNs - inferior frontal, posterior opercular, early auditory, auditory association cortices); Sensorimotor Networks (SMNs - premotor, somatosensory, paralobular, and motor cortices); These anterior regions of the brain with lesser genetic influence are implicated in various TPN processes; for example in high-level cognitive and affective processes such as working memory, executive function, reasoning, attentional and impulse control, emotional judgement and decision making (FPNs); language and auditory processes (FTNs); action-planning and movement processes (SMN).

There was a mix of high (posterior) and low (anterior) density of genetically influenced functional connections involving the extended Default Mode Network (eDMN). Specifically, there was a high density of genetically-influenced functional connections involving predominantly posterior-medial regions of eDMN - hippocampus and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices; There was a low density of genetically influenced connections involving anterior regions (anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal) and lateral (inferior parietal, temporoparietooccipital) regions of the eDMN. The eDMN is involved in low-level cognitive and affective processes such as those involved in episodic memory retrieval, mental imagery, introspection, rumination, evaluation of self and others.

These differences in genetic influence on posterior (more) vs. anterior (less) brain regions may have implications in terms of the environmental influence (e.g., education, school and work environment, family and home environment, social interaction with friends and peers, medications, nutrition, sports and physical exercise) on posterior (less) vs. anterior (more) portions of the brain during development and later in life.

Gender-Specific Results &amp; DiscussionAs noted at the population level, both males and females were under extensive genetic influence in terms of network interactions involving visual cortices. In addition, males were more genetically influenced in terms of network interactions involving auditory-language related cortices compared to females. This finding suggests that males may be more functionally "hard-wired" and females may be more environmentally influenced and shaped in terms of auditory-language systems than males.

As noted at the population level, both males and females were under extensive genetic influence in terms of interactions involving the eDMN which is considered a central hub of the brain for various processes such as internal monitoring, rumination and evaluation of self and others, as noted previously. In addition, males also were more genetically influenced compared to females in terms of intranetwork and internetwork interactions of eDMN and other brain regions (occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal regions) involved in various task-oriented processes and attending to and interacting with the environment which comprise part of the Task Positive Networks (TPNs). There were also nearly five times more genetically influenced functional connections in males (310) than females (64) suggesting that male brains are more genetically influenced, i.e. functionally "hard-wired", than females. This result suggests differences in genetic predisposition in males (more) vs. females (less) in terms of interplay of attending to task-oriented interactions with the environment (TPNs) vs. internal and external interactions with self and others (eDMN). This finding may also have implications in terms of brain plasticity differences in males (less) versus females (more) in terms of ability to react or adapt/maladapt to environmental influences (e.g. task completion demands, psychosocial stressors, positive and negative feedback, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy) and their overall malleability.

These results reveal the similarities and differences of genetics and environmental influences on different connections, areas, and networks of the resting state functional brain in young healthy males and females with implications in development and later in life. This unique method can be applied in healthy as well as in patient populations to reveal the genetic and environmental influences on the brain.

SignificanceThere were high vs. low genetic influences on posterior vs. anterior brain regions involved in low-level visuospatial processes vs. high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning and language respectively. This finding may have implications in terms of the brain to be environmentally influenced (e.g., school, work and home environment) during development and later in life.

There were nearly five times more genetically influenced functional connections in males than females in brain regions involved in task-oriented interactions with environment vs. interactions with self and others. This finding may have implications in terms of brain plasticity differences in males (less) versus females (more) in terms of ability to adapt/maladapt to environmental influences (e.g. task completion demands, psychosocial stressors, various therapies) and their overall malleability. This is the first study to our knowledge to assess the heritability across young healthy adults both in general and specific to gender.

Color perception relies on spatial comparisons of chromatic signals, but how the brain performs these comparisons is poorly understood. Here, we show that many V1 neurons compare signals across their receptive fields (RF) using a common principle. We estimated the spatial-chromatic RFs of each neuron, and then measured neural selectivity to customized colored edges that were sampled using a novel closed-loop technique. We found that many double-opponent (DO) cells, which have spatially and chromatically opponent RFs, responded to chromatic contrast as a weighted sum, akin to how simple cells respond to luminance contrast. Other neurons integrated chromatic signals non-linearly, confirming that linear signal integration is not an obligate property of V1 neurons. The functional similarity of DO and simple cells suggests a common underlying neural circuitry, promotes the construction of image-computable models for full-color image representation, and sheds new light on V1 complex cells.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430967v1?rss=1">Cholinergic signalling at the body wall neuromuscular junction couples to distal inhibition of feeding in C. elegans</a></h4>

Complex biological functions within organisms are frequently orchestrated by systemic communication between tissues. In the model organism C. elegans, the pharyngeal and body wall neuromuscular junctions are two discrete structures that control feeding and locomotion, respectively. These distinct tissues are controlled by separate, well-defined neural circuits. Nonetheless, the emergent behaviours, feeding and locomotion, are coordinated to guarantee the efficiency of food intake. We show that pharmacological hyperactivation of cholinergic transmission at the body wall muscle reduces the rate of pumping behaviour. This was evidenced by a systematic screening of the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarbs effect on the rate of pharyngeal pumping on food in mutant worms. The screening revealed that the key determinant of the inhibitory effect of aldicarb on pharyngeal pumping is the L-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in body wall muscle. This idea was reinforced by the observation that selective hyperstimulation of the body wall muscle L-type receptor by the agonist levamisole inhibited pumping. Overall, our results reveal that body wall cholinergic transmission controls locomotion and simultaneously couples a distal inhibition of feeding.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430903v1?rss=1">Modest changes in Spi1 dosage reveal the potential for altered microglial function as seen in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

Genetic association studies have identified multiple variants at the SPI1 locus that modify risk and age of onset for Alzheimers Disease (AD). Reports linking risk variants to gene expression suggest that variants denoting higher SPI1 expression are likely to have an earlier AD onset, and several other AD risk genes contain PU.1 binding sites in the promoter region. Overall, this suggests altered levels of SPi1 may alter microglial phenotype potentially impacting AD. This study determined how the mouse microglial transcriptome was altered following modest changes to Spi1 expression in primary microglia. RNA-sequencing was performed on microglia with reduced or increased Spi1/PU.1 expression to provide an unbiased approach to determine transcriptomic changes affected by Spi1. In summary, a reduction in microglial Spi1 resulted in the dysregulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in DNA replication pathways while an increased Spi1 results in an upregulation of genes associated with immune response pathways. Additionally, a subset of 194 Spi1 dose-sensitive genes was identified and pathway analysis suggests that several innate immune and interferon response pathways are impacted by the concentration of Spi1. Together these results suggest Spi1 levels can alter the microglial transcriptome and suggests interferon pathways may be altered in individuals with AD related Spi1 risk SNPs.

Oligodendrocytes exert a profound influence on neural circuits by accelerating axon potential conduction, altering excitability and providing metabolic support. As oligodendrogenesis continues in the adult brain and is essential for myelin repair, uncovering the factors that control their dynamics is necessary to understand the consequences of adaptive myelination and develop new strategies to enhance remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, few methods exist for analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics, and even fewer are suitable for in vivo investigation. Here, we describe the development of a fully automated cell tracking pipeline using convolutional neural networks (Oligo-Track) that provides rapid volumetric segmentation and tracking of thousands of cells over weeks in vivo. This system reliably replicated human analysis, outperformed traditional analytic approaches, and extracted injury and repair dynamics at multiple cortical depths, establishing that oligodendrogenesis after cuprizone-mediated demyelination is suppressed in deeper cortical layers. Volumetric data provided by this analysis revealed that oligodendrocyte soma size progressively decreases after their generation, and declines further prior to death, providing a means to predict cell age and eventual cell death from individual time points. This new CNN-based analysis pipeline offers a rapid, robust method to quantitatively analyze oligodendrocyte dynamics in vivo, which will aid in understanding how changes in these myelinating cells influence circuit function and recovery from injury and disease.

SIPA1L1 (also known as SPAR1) has been proposed to regulate synaptic functions that are important in maintaining normal neuronal activities, such as regulating spine growth and synaptic scaling, as a component of the postsynaptic density (PSD)-95/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)-complex. However, contrary to this view, our super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopic analyses demonstrate that SIPA1L1 is mainly localized to general submembranous and cytoplasmic regions in neurons, but scarcely to PSD. Our screening for native interactors of SIPA1L1 identified spinophilin and neurabin-1, regulators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but rejected PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex components. Furthermore, Sipa1l1-/- mice showed normal spine size distribution and NMDA-R-dependent synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, Sipa1l1-/- mice showed aberrant responses to 2-adrenergic receptor (a spinophilin target) or adenosine A1 receptor (a neurabin-1 target) agonist stimulation and striking behavioral anomalies, such as hyperactivity, enhanced anxiety, learning impairments, social interaction deficits, and enhanced epileptic seizure susceptibility. Our findings revealed unexpected properties of SIPA1L1, suggesting a possible association of SIPA1L1 deficiency with neuropsychiatric disorders related to dysregulated GPCR signaling, such as epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, or fragile X syndrome.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430852v1?rss=1">Impaired clock gene expression and abnormal diurnal regulation of hippocampal inhibitory transmission and spatial memory in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

Patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) often have fragmentation of sleep/wake cycles and disrupted 24-h (circadian) activity. Despite this, little work has investigated the potential underlying day/night disruptions in cognition and neuronal physiology in the hippocampus. The molecular clock, an intrinsic transcription-translation feedback loop that regulates circadian behavior, may also regulate hippocampal neurophysiological activity. We hypothesized that disrupted diurnal variation in clock gene expression in the hippocampus corresponds with loss of normal day/night differences in membrane excitability, synaptic physiology, and cognition. We previously reported that the Tg-SwDI mouse model of AD has disrupted circadian locomotor rhythms and neurophysiological output of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the primary circadian clock). Here, we report that Tg-SwDI mice failed to show day-night differences in a spatial working memory task, unlike wild-type controls that exhibited enhanced spatial working memory at night. Moreover, Tg-SwDI mice had lower levels of Per2, one of the core components of the molecular clock, at both mRNA and protein levels when compared to age-matched controls. Interestingly, we discovered neurophysiological impairments in area CA1 of the Tg-SwDI hippocampus. In controls, spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal cells showed greater amplitude and lower inter-event interval during the day than the night. However, the normal day/night differences in sIPSCs were absent (amplitude) or reversed (inter-event interval) in pyramidal cells from Tg-SwDI mice. In control mice, current injection into CA1 pyramidal cells produced more firing during the night than during the day, but no day/night difference in excitability was observed in Tg-SwDI mice. The normal day/night difference in excitability in controls was blocked by GABA receptor inhibition. Together, these results demonstrate that the normal diurnal regulation of inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus is diminished in a mouse model of AD, leading to decreased daytime inhibition onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Uncovering disrupted day/night differences in circadian gene regulation, hippocampal physiology, and memory in AD mouse models may provide insight into possible chronotherapeutic strategies to ameliorate Alzheimers disease symptoms or delay pathological onset.

Objective
Identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome‐wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with: (i) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls, and (ii) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified: rs7066890 (OR=1.10 [1.06‐1.14]; P=2.2x10‐9) intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR=1.10 [1.07‐1.14]; P=1.6x10‐8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR=1.16 [1.03‐1.30]; P=0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in GTEx. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify two genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10.These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk.

Objective
To describe a novel biomarker of germ‐cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ‐cell tumor associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular‐cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein western blot, ELISA and cell based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/CSF.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)‐IgG was detected in 28 patients’ sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range 28‐84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &gt;1:6400; normal value &lt;1:50). Co‐existent Kelch‐like protein 11‐IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28; 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n=5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n=2, 7%) and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n=4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27; 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body FDG‐PET scan (43%) were extra‐testicular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ‐cell tumors were found in four patients. Exposure of T‐cell‐dendritic‐cell co‐cultures from chronic immunosuppression naïve LUZP4‐IgG‐seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69‐expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ‐cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+T‐cell‐mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and anti‐tumor potential.

Objective
To study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between Aβ aggregation as measured by the ratio Aβ1‐42/1‐40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n=194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (BACE1, Aβ1‐40 and 1‐38) and CSF tau. Associations amongst markers were tested with Generalized Estimating Equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid‐PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid‐PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range 0.73, 0.86; all p&lt;0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strong (r range 0.50, 0.64; all p&lt;0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1‐38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1‐42/1‐40 ratios, t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their co‐twins (r range ‐0.28, 0.58; all p&lt;.007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range 0.49, 0.61; all p&lt;0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe neuropsychiatric complication of live cirrhosis. We identified the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus in HE patient.

Abstract
Neuropsychiatric deficits are common in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), especially in those with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Previous studies reveal abnormalities in brain activity underlying the neuropsychiatric deficits in LC patients; however, the results are inconsistent. We conducted a meta‐analysis of resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using anisotropic effect‐size signed differential mapping software on LC patients to characterize the most consistent regional activity alterations, and to evaluate the potential effect of liver transplantation (LT) on brain function. Meta‐regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between brain alterations and clinical variables. Compared with healthy controls, the typical patterns of increased regional activity in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar network and decreased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and cingulate gyrus were identified in LC patients, which remained significant in the subgroup meta‐analyses of minimal HE (MHE) and overt HE (OHE) patients. Functional deficits in the default mode network (DMN) were found in OHE patients compared with MHE patients. Ammonia level positively correlated with brain activity in the right middle temporal gyrus, and the completion time of number connection test A negatively correlated with brain activity in the left anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, patients showed increased activity in the visuo‐sensorimotor network and precuneus after LT. Our study suggests that alterations in the fronto‐striato‐cerebellar and visuo‐sensorimotor networks may be the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HE, and deficits in the DMN may indicate the progression of HE. LT may improve brain function in the visuo‐sensorimotor network. This study has registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020212758).

Our results showed that BNN20 increases the number of mature OLs in the lesion site of the LPC‐induced demyelination mouse model, while it reduces astrocytic accumulation, leading to a faster remyelination process. It does not significantly alter OPC recruitment or microglia/macrophages accumulation. Furthermore, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly on OLs by enhancing their maturation. In addition, BNN20 treatment increased the number of LPC‐treated mature OLs and this beneficial effect was TrkA‐dependent. Moreover, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to the pro‐inflammatory state upon LPS stimulation in vitro. In conclusion, our results indicate that BNN20 is a multifaceted agent against demyelinating conditions by being able to affect all glial populations.

Abstract
BNN20, a C17‐spiroepoxy derivative of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone, has been shown to exhibit strong neuroprotective properties but its role in glial populations has not been assessed. Our aim was to investigate the effect of BNN20 on glial populations by using in vitro and in vivo approaches, taking advantage of the well‐established lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)‐induced focal demyelination mouse model. Our in vivo studies, performed in male mice, showed that BNN20 treatment leads to an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in this model. It diminishes astrocytic accumulation during the demyelination phase leading to a faster remyelination process, while it does not affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment or microglia/macrophage accumulation. Additionally, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly to OLs and enhances their maturation even after they were treated with LPC. This beneficial effect of BNN20 is mediated, primarily, through the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. In addition, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to their pro‐inflammatory state upon lipopolysaccharides stimulation in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that BNN20 could serve as an important molecule to develop blood–brain barrier‐permeable synthetic agonists of neurotrophin receptors that could reduce inflammation, protect and increase the number of functional OLs by promoting their differentiation/maturation.

Microfluidic techniques have enabled in vitro neuronal circuits and blood–brain barrier (BBB) models with increasing physiological relevance. This review summarizes how these systems are now being used to study disease processes from synaptic transmission to BBB breakdown, opening up new possibilities to model neurological diseases using human cells.

Abstract
Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second largest cause of death worldwide. Despite significant research efforts, neurology remains one of the most failure‐prone areas of drug development. The complexity of the human brain, boundaries to examining the brain directly in vivo, and the significant evolutionary gap between animal models and humans, all serve to hamper translational success. Recent advances in microfluidic in vitro models have provided new opportunities to study human cells with enhanced physiological relevance. The ability to precisely micro‐engineer cell‐scale architecture, tailoring form and function, has allowed for detailed dissection of cell biology using microphysiological systems (MPS) of varying complexities from single cell systems to “Organ‐on‐chip” models. Simplified neuronal networks have allowed for unique insights into neuronal transport and neurogenesis, while more complex 3D heterotypic cellular models such as neurovascular unit mimetics and “Organ‐on‐chip” systems have enabled new understanding of metabolic coupling and blood–brain barrier transport. These systems are now being developed beyond MPS toward disease specific micro‐pathophysiological systems, moving from “Organ‐on‐chip” to “Disease‐on‐chip.” This review gives an outline of current state of the art in microfluidic technologies for neurological disease research, discussing the challenges and limitations while highlighting the benefits and potential of integrating technologies. We provide examples of where such toolsets have enabled novel insights and how these technologies may empower future investigation into neurological diseases.

Abstract
Sodium salicylate, one of the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, is widely prescribed in the clinic, but a high dose of usage can cause hyperactivity in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. At present, the neural mechanism underlying the induced hyperactivity is not fully understood, in particular, in the hippocampus under an in vivo condition. In this study, we found that systemic administration of sodium salicylate increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and the population spike amplitude in a dose‐dependent manner in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area of rats with in vivo field potential extracellular recordings, which indicates that sodium salicylate enhances basal synaptic transmission and neural excitation. In the presence of picrotoxin, a GABA‐A receptor antagonist, sodium salicylate failed to increase the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amplitude of the population spike in vivo. To further explore how sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation, we made whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings from hippocampal slices. We found that perfusion of the slice with sodium salicylate decreased electrically evoked GABA receptor‐mediated currents, increased paired‐pulse ratio, and lowered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, these results demonstrate that sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation through suppressing GABAergic synaptic transmission in presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area. Our findings may help understand the side effects caused by sodium salicylate in the central nervous system.

The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e. DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (PCNA, Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin), and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain, and contribute to this growth.

<p>by Jordane Preto, Isabelle Krimm</p>

The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a critical β-barrel membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which regulates the transport of ions and ATP between mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In addition, VDAC plays a central role in the control of apoptosis and is therefore of great interest in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Although not fully understood, it is presumed that the gating mechanism of VDAC is governed by its N-terminal region which, in the open state of the channel, exhibits an α-helical structure positioned midway inside the pore and strongly interacting with the β-barrel wall. In the present work, we performed molecular simulations with a recently developed force field for disordered systems to shed new light on known experimental results, showing that the N-terminus of VDAC is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). First, simulation of the N-terminal segment as a free peptide highlighted its disordered nature and the importance of using an IDR-specific force field to properly sample its conformational landscape. Secondly, accelerated dynamics simulation of a double cysteine VDAC mutant under applied voltage revealed metastable low conducting states of the channel representative of closed states observed experimentally. Related structures were characterized by partial unfolding and rearrangement of the N-terminal tail, that led to steric hindrance of the pore. Our results indicate that the disordered properties of the N-terminus are crucial to properly account for the gating mechanism of VDAC.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vq74hJpoero" width="1" />

<p>by Ann-Kristin Becker, Marcus Dörr, Stephan B. Felix, Fabian Frost, Hans J. Grabe, Markus M. Lerch, Matthias Nauck, Uwe Völker, Henry Völzke, Lars Kaderali</p>

In this work, we introduce an entirely data-driven and automated approach to reveal disease-associated biomarker and risk factor networks from heterogeneous and high-dimensional healthcare data. Our workflow is based on Bayesian networks, which are a popular tool for analyzing the interplay of biomarkers. Usually, data require extensive manual preprocessing and dimension reduction to allow for effective learning of Bayesian networks. For heterogeneous data, this preprocessing is hard to automatize and typically requires domain-specific prior knowledge. We here combine Bayesian network learning with hierarchical variable clustering in order to detect groups of similar features and learn interactions between them entirely automated. We present an optimization algorithm for the adaptive refinement of such group Bayesian networks to account for a specific target variable, like a disease. The combination of Bayesian networks, clustering, and refinement yields low-dimensional but disease-specific interaction networks. These networks provide easily interpretable, yet accurate models of biomarker interdependencies. We test our method extensively on simulated data, as well as on data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND), and demonstrate its effectiveness using non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension as examples. We show that the group network models outperform available biomarker scores, while at the same time, they provide an easily interpretable interaction network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkNdrJc6Bg4" width="1" />

<p>by Michael Raatz, Saumil Shah, Guranda Chitadze, Monika Brüggemann, Arne Traulsen</p>

Intratumour heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a frequent problem for cancer treatment as it allows for the evolution of resistance against treatment. While cancer genotyping becomes more and more established and allows to determine the genetic heterogeneity, less is known about the phenotypic heterogeneity among cancer cells. We investigate how phenotypic differences can impact the efficiency of therapy options that select on this diversity, compared to therapy options that are independent of the phenotype. We employ the ecological concept of trait distributions and characterize the cancer cell population as a collection of subpopulations that differ in their growth rate. We show in a deterministic model that growth rate-dependent treatment types alter the trait distribution of the cell population, resulting in a delayed relapse compared to a growth rate-independent treatment. Whether the cancer cell population goes extinct or relapse occurs is determined by stochastic dynamics, which we investigate using a stochastic model. Again, we find that relapse is delayed for the growth rate-dependent treatment type, albeit an increased relapse probability, suggesting that slowly growing subpopulations are shielded from extinction. Sequential application of growth rate-dependent and growth rate-independent treatment types can largely increase treatment efficiency and delay relapse. Interestingly, even longer intervals between decisions to change the treatment type may achieve close-to-optimal efficiencies and relapse times. Monitoring patients at regular check-ups may thus provide the temporally resolved guidance to tailor treatments to the changing cancer cell trait distribution and allow clinicians to cope with this dynamic heterogeneity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aYkw248ZmSs" width="1" />

<p>by Qiao Liu, Lei Xie</p>

Drug combinations have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatments. They alleviate drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The fast-growing number of anti-cancer drugs has caused the experimental investigation of all drug combinations to become costly and time-consuming. Computational techniques can improve the efficiency of drug combination screening. Despite recent advances in applying machine learning to synergistic drug combination prediction, several challenges remain. First, the performance of existing methods is suboptimal. There is still much space for improvement. Second, biological knowledge has not been fully incorporated into the model. Finally, many models are lack interpretability, limiting their clinical applications. To address these challenges, we have developed a knowledge-enabled and self-attention transformer boosted deep learning model, TranSynergy, which improves the performance and interpretability of synergistic drug combination prediction. TranSynergy is designed so that the cellular effect of drug actions can be explicitly modeled through cell-line gene dependency, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide drug-target interaction. A novel Shapley Additive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (SA-GSEA) method has been developed to deconvolute genes that contribute to the synergistic drug combination and improve model interpretability. Extensive benchmark studies demonstrate that TranSynergy outperforms the state-of-the-art method, suggesting the potential of mechanism-driven machine learning. Novel pathways that are associated with the synergistic combinations are revealed and supported by experimental evidence. They may provide new insights into identifying biomarkers for precision medicine and discovering new anti-cancer therapies. Several new synergistic drug combinations have been predicted with high confidence for ovarian cancer which has few treatment options.

<p>by Johannes Bracher, Evan L. Ray, Tilmann Gneiting, Nicholas G. Reich</p>

For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the <i>COVID-19 Forecast Hub</i> (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W7lxFydOLE0" width="1" />

<p>by Wei Lu, Carlos Bueno, Nicholas P. Schafer, Joshua Moller, Shikai Jin, Xun Chen, Mingchen Chen, Xinyu Gu, Aram Davtyan, Juan J. de Pablo, Peter G. Wolynes</p>

We present OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2, new cross-compatible implementations of coarse-grained models for protein (AWSEM) and DNA (3SPN2) molecular dynamics simulations within the OpenMM framework. These new implementations retain the chemical accuracy and intrinsic efficiency of the original models while adding GPU acceleration and the ease of forcefield modification provided by OpenMM’s Custom Forces software framework. By utilizing GPUs, we achieve around a 30-fold speedup in protein and protein-DNA simulations over the existing LAMMPS-based implementations running on a single CPU core. We showcase the benefits of OpenMM’s Custom Forces framework by devising and implementing two new potentials that allow us to address important aspects of protein folding and structure prediction and by testing the ability of the combined OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2 to model protein-DNA binding. The first potential is used to describe the changes in effective interactions that occur as a protein becomes partially buried in a membrane. We also introduced an interaction to describe proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Using simple pairwise disulfide bonding terms results in unphysical clustering of cysteine residues, posing a problem when simulating the folding of proteins with many cysteines. We now can computationally reproduce Anfinsen’s early Nobel prize winning experiments by using OpenMM’s Custom Forces framework to introduce a multi-body disulfide bonding term that prevents unphysical clustering. Our protein-DNA simulations show that the binding landscape is funneled towards structures that are quite similar to those found using experiments. In summary, this paper provides a simulation tool for the molecular biophysics community that is both easy to use and sufficiently efficient to simulate large proteins and large protein-DNA systems that are central to many cellular processes. These codes should facilitate the interplay between molecular simulations and cellular studies, which have been hampered by the large mismatch between the time and length scales accessible to molecular simulations and those relevant to cell biology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LCxJndAzN8w" width="1" />

<p>by Guillaume P. Dehaene, Ruben Coen-Cagli, Alexandre Pouget</p>

Skilled behavior often displays signatures of Bayesian inference. In order for the brain to implement the required computations, neuronal activity must carry accurate information about the uncertainty of sensory inputs. Two major approaches have been proposed to study neuronal representations of uncertainty. The first one, the Bayesian decoding approach, aims primarily at decoding the posterior probability distribution of the stimulus from population activity using Bayes’ rule, and indirectly yields uncertainty estimates as a by-product. The second one, which we call the correlational approach, searches for specific features of neuronal activity (such as tuning-curve width and maximum firing-rate) which correlate with uncertainty. To compare these two approaches, we derived a new normative model of sound source localization by Interaural Time Difference (ITD), that reproduces a wealth of behavioral and neural observations. We found that several features of neuronal activity correlated with uncertainty on average, but none provided an accurate estimate of uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating that the correlational approach may not reliably identify which aspects of neuronal responses represent uncertainty. In contrast, the Bayesian decoding approach reveals that the activity pattern of the entire population was required to reconstruct the trial-to-trial posterior distribution with Bayes’ rule. These results suggest that uncertainty is unlikely to be represented in a single feature of neuronal activity, and highlight the importance of using a Bayesian decoding approach when exploring the neural basis of uncertainty.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tRxROqEkr3o" width="1" />

<p>by Mathew Titus, George Hagstrom, James R. Watson</p>

Collective behavior is an emergent property of numerous complex systems, from financial markets to cancer cells to predator-prey ecological systems. Characterizing modes of collective behavior is often done through human observation, training generative models, or other supervised learning techniques. Each of these cases requires knowledge of and a method for characterizing the macro-state(s) of the system. This presents a challenge for studying novel systems where there may be little prior knowledge. Here, we present a new unsupervised method of detecting emergent behavior in complex systems, and discerning between distinct collective behaviors. We require only metrics, <i>d</i><sup>(1)</sup>, <i>d</i><sup>(2)</sup>, defined on the set of agents, <i>X</i>, which measure agents’ nearness in variables of interest. We apply the method of diffusion maps to the systems (<i>X</i>, <i>d</i><sup>(i)</sup>) to recover efficient embeddings of their interaction networks. Comparing these geometries, we formulate a measure of similarity between two networks, called the map alignment statistic (MAS). A large MAS is evidence that the two networks are codetermined in some fashion, indicating an emergent relationship between the metrics <i>d</i><sup>(1)</sup> and <i>d</i><sup>(2)</sup>. Additionally, the form of the macro-scale organization is encoded in the covariances among the two sets of diffusion map components. Using these covariances we discern between different modes of collective behavior in a data-driven, unsupervised manner. This method is demonstrated on a synthetic flocking model as well as empirical fish schooling data. We show that our state classification subdivides the known behaviors of the school in a meaningful manner, leading to a finer description of the system’s behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y2ws0d9jEAE" width="1" />

We used immunohistochemistry to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) in the brain of the Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina).







Abstract
Because of their roles in courtship and intrasexual competition, sexual displays are often sexually dimorphic, but we know little about the mechanisms that produce such dimorphism. Among mammals, one example is the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), which consists of a series of rapidly repeated, frequency‐modulated notes. The rate and duration of songs is sexually dimorphic and androgen responsive. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism, we map the sites of androgen sensitivity throughout the brain, focusing analysis along a pathway that spans from limbic structures to vocal motor regions. We find widespread expression of AR immunoreactivity (AR‐ir) throughout limbic structures important for social behavior and vocalization, including the lateral septum, extended amygdala, preoptic area and hypothalamus. We also find extensive AR staining along previously documented vocal motor pathways, including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus ambiguus, the last of which innervates intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Lastly, AR‐ir is also evident in sensory areas such as the medial geniculate, inferior, and superior colliculi. A quantitative analysis revealed that males exhibited more AR‐ir than females, a pattern that was most pronounced in the hypothalamus. Despite the elaboration of vocalization in singing mice, comparison with prior literature suggests that the broad pattern of AR‐ir may be conserved across a wide range of rodents. Together these data identify brain nuclei well positioned to shape the sexually dimorphic vocalization of S. teguina and suggest that such androgen modulation of vocalization is evolutionary conserved among rodents.

At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Further, darkness reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for a lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.

Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 dysferlinopathy patients over three years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and non‐ambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3–8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinics practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

<p>Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data makes studying the development of
cells possible at unparalleled resolution. Given that many cellular
differentiation processes are hierarchical, their scRNA-seq data is expected to
be approximately tree-shaped in gene expression space. Inference and
representation of this tree-structure in two dimensions is highly desirable for
biological interpretation and exploratory analysis. Our two contributions are
an approach for identifying a meaningful tree structure from high-dimensional
scRNA-seq data, and a visualization method respecting the tree-structure. We
extract the tree structure by means of a density based minimum spanning tree on
a vector quantization of the data and show that it captures biological
information well. We then introduce DTAE, a tree-biased autoencoder that
emphasizes the tree structure of the data in low dimensional space. We compare
to other dimension reduction methods and demonstrate the success of our method
experimentally. Our implementation relying on PyTorch and Higra is available at
github.com/hci-unihd/DTAE.

<p>This paper introduces a new deep learning approach to approximately solve the
Covering Salesman Problem (CSP). In this approach, given the city locations of
a CSP as input, a deep neural network model is designed to directly output the
solution. It is trained using the deep reinforcement learning without
supervision. Specifically, in the model, we apply the Multi-head Attention to
capture the structural patterns, and design a dynamic embedding to handle the
dynamic patterns of the problem. Once the model is trained, it can generalize
to various types of CSP tasks (different sizes and topologies) with no need of
re-training. Through controlled experiments, the proposed approach shows
desirable time complexity: it runs more than 20 times faster than the
traditional heuristic solvers with a tiny gap of optimality. Moreover, it
significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
for combinatorial optimization in the aspect of both training and inference. In
comparison with traditional solvers, this approach is highly desirable for most
of the challenging tasks in practice that are usually large-scale and require
quick decisions.

<p>The use of evolutionary methods in design and art is increasing in diversity
and popularity. Approaches to using these methods for creative production
typically focus either on optimisation or exploration. In this paper we
introduce an evolutionary system for design that combines these two approaches,
enabling users to explore landscapes of design alternatives using
design-oriented measures of fitness, along with their own aesthetic
preferences. We test our methods using a biologically-inspired generative
system capable of producing 3D objects that can be exported directly as 3D
printing toolpath instructions. For the search stage of our system we combine
the use of the CMA-ES algorithm for optimisation and linear interpolation
between generated objects for feature exploration. We investigate the system`s
capabilities by evolving highly fit artefacts and then combining them with
aesthetically interesting ones.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05814">Anomaly Detection through Transfer Learning in Agriculture and Manufacturing IoT Systems. (arXiv:2102.05814v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>IoT systems have been facing increasingly sophisticated technical problems
due to the growing complexity of these systems and their fast deployment
practices. Consequently, IoT managers have to judiciously detect failures
(anomalies) in order to reduce their cyber risk and operational cost. While
there is a rich literature on anomaly detection in many IoT-based systems,
there is no existing work that documents the use of ML models for anomaly
detection in digital agriculture and in smart manufacturing systems. These two
application domains pose certain salient technical challenges. In agriculture
the data is often sparse, due to the vast areas of farms and the requirement to
keep the cost of monitoring low. Second, in both domains, there are multiple
types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data
characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines,
such as, the RPM of the motor. The inferencing and the anomaly detection
processes therefore have to be calibrated for the operating point.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we analyze data from sensors deployed in an agricultural farm
with data from seven different kinds of sensors, and from an advanced
manufacturing testbed with vibration sensors. We evaluate the performance of
ARIMA and LSTM models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then,
considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer
learning from a high data rate sensor. We then perform anomaly detection using
the predicted sensor data. Taken together, we show how in these two application
domains, predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way
for predictive maintenance.

<p>Addressing a complex real-world optimization problem is a challenging task.
The chance-constrained knapsack problem with correlated uniform weights plays
an important role in the case where dependent stochastic components are
considered. We perform runtime analysis of a randomized search algorithm (RSA)
and a basic evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the chance-constrained knapsack
problem with correlated uniform weights. We prove bounds for both algorithms
for producing a feasible solution. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of
the algorithms and carry out analyses on two settings: uniform profit value and
the setting in which every group shares an arbitrary profit profile. We provide
insight into the structure of these problems and show how the weight
correlations and the different types of profit profiles influence the runtime
behavior of both algorithms in the chance-constrained setting.

<p>Recently introduced EASE algorithm presents a simple and elegant way, how to
solve the top-N recommendation task. In this paper, we introduce Neural EASE to
further improve the performance of this algorithm by incorporating techniques
for training modern neural networks. Also, there is a growing interest in the
recsys community to utilize variational autoencoders (VAE) for this task. We
introduce deep autoencoder FLVAE benefiting from multiple non-linear layers
without an information bottleneck while not overfitting towards the identity.
We show how to learn FLVAE in parallel with Neural EASE and achieve the state
of the art performance on the MovieLens 20M dataset and competitive results on
the Netflix Prize dataset.

<p>Background: This comprehensive meta-analysis aimed to assess whether an increased homocysteine (Hcy) level is an independent predictor of unfavorable outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients.</p><p>Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to August 1, 2020 to collect studies reporting Hcy levels in AIS patients. We analyzed all the data using Review Manager 5.3 software.</p><p>Results: Seventeen studies with 15,636 AIS patients were selected for evaluation. A higher Hcy level was associated with a poorer survival outcome (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.25–1.63). Compared with the AIS group, Hcy levels were significantly lower in the healthy control patients, with an SMD of 5.11 and 95% CI (1.87–8.35). Analysis of the different subgroups of AIS demonstrated significant associations between high Hcy levels and survival outcomes only in Caucasian and Asian patients. Moreover, whereas high Hcy levels were closely associated with gender, B12 deficiency, smoking, and patients who received tissue plasminogen activator treatment, no significant difference was found between increased Hcy levels and age, drinking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. In addition, the cut-off value (20.0 μmol/L) might be an optimum cut-off index for AIS patients in clinical practice.</p><p>Conclusion: This meta-analysis reveals that the Hcy level may serve as an independent predictor for unfavorable survival outcomes in AIS patients, particularly in Caucasian and Asian AIS patients. Further studies can be conducted to clarify this relationship.</p>

<p>The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that are translated into an expanded polyQ stretch in the disease-causative proteins. The expanded polyQ stretch itself plays a critical disease-causative role in the pathomechanisms underlying polyQ diseases. Notably, the expanded polyQ stretch undergoes a conformational transition from the native monomer into the β-sheet-rich monomer, followed by the formation of soluble oligomers and then insoluble aggregates with amyloid fibrillar structures. The intermediate soluble species including the β-sheet-rich monomer and oligomers exhibit substantial neurotoxicity. Therefore, protein conformation stabilization and aggregation inhibition that target the upstream of the insoluble aggregate formation would be a promising approach toward the development of disease-modifying therapies for polyQ diseases. PolyQ aggregation inhibitors of different chemical categories, such as intrabodies, peptides, and small chemical compounds, have been identified through intensive screening methods. Among them, recent advances in the brain delivery methods of several peptides and the screening of small chemical compounds have brought them closer to clinical utility. Notably, the recent discovery of arginine as a potent conformation stabilizer and aggregation inhibitor of polyQ proteins both in vitro and in vivo have paved way to the clinical trial for the patients with polyQ diseases. Meanwhile, expression reduction of expanded polyQ proteins per se would be another promising approach toward disease modification of polyQ diseases. Gene silencing, especially by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), have succeeded in reducing the expression of polyQ proteins in the animal models of various polyQ diseases by targeting the aberrant mRNA with expanded CAG repeats. Of note, some of these ASOs have recently been translated into clinical trials. Here we overview and discuss these recent advances toward the development of disease modifying therapies for polyQ diseases. We envision that combination therapies using aggregation inhibitors and gene silencing would meet the needs of the patients with polyQ diseases and their caregivers in the near future to delay or prevent the onset and progression of these currently intractable diseases.</p>

Objective<p>Complement activation is instrumental in the pathogenesis of Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a significant cause of neonatal mortality and disability worldwide. Therapeutic hypothermia (HT), the only available treatment for HIE, only modestly improves outcomes. Complement modulation as a therapeutic adjunct to HT has been considered, but is challenging due to the wide-ranging role of the complement system in neuroinflammation, homeostasis and neurogenesis in the developing brain. We sought to identify potential therapeutic targets by measuring the impact of treatment with HT on complement effector expression in neurons and glia in neonatal HIE, with particular emphasis on the interactions between microglia and C1q.</p>Methods<p>The Vannucci model was used to induce HIE in term-equivalent rat pups. At P10-12, pups were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups: Sham (control), normothermia (NT), and hypothermia (HT) treatment. Local and systemic complement expression and neuronal apoptosis were measured by ELISA, TUNEL and immunofluorescence labeling, and differences compared between groups.</p>Results<p>Treatment with HT is associated with decreased systemic and microglial expression of C1q, decreased systemic C5a levels, and decreased microglial and neuronal deposition of C3 and C9. The effect of HT on cytokines was variable with decreased expression of pro and anti-inflammatory effectors. HT treatment was associated with decreased C1q binding on cells undergoing apoptosis.</p>Conclusion<p>Our data demonstrate the extreme complexity of the immune response in neonatal HIE. We propose modulation of downstream effectors C3a and C5a as a therapeutic adjunct to HT to enhance neuroprotection in the developing brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.613801">A New Apparatus for Recording Evoked Responses to Painful and Non-painful Sensory Stimulation in Freely Moving Mice</a></h4>

<p>Experiments on pain processing in animals face several methodological challenges including the reproducible application of painful stimuli. Ideally, behavioral and physiological correlates of pain should be assessed in freely behaving mice, avoiding stress, fear or behavioral restriction as confounding factors. Moreover, the time of pain-evoked brain activity should be precisely related to the time of stimulation, such that pain-specific neuronal activity can be unambiguously identified. This can be achieved with laser-evoked heat stimuli which are also well established for human pain research. However, laser-evoked neuronal potentials are rarely investigated in awake unrestrained rodents, partially due to the practical difficulties in precisely and reliably targeting and triggering stimulation. In order to facilitate such studies we have developed a versatile stimulation and recording system for freely moving mice. The custom-made apparatus can provide both laser- and mechanical stimuli with simultaneous recording of evoked potentials and behavioral responses. Evoked potentials can be recorded from superficial and deep brain areas showing graded pain responses which correlate with pain-specific behavioral reactions. Non-painful mechanical stimuli can be applied as a control, yielding clearly different electrophysiological and behavioral responses. The apparatus is suited for simultaneous acquisition of precisely timed electrophysiological and behavioral evoked responses in freely moving mice. Besides its application in pain research it may be also useful in other fields of sensory physiology.</p>

<p>With prevalence of electrophysiological data collected outside of the laboratory from portable, non-invasive modalities growing at a rapid rate, the quality of these recorded data, if not adequate, could affect the effectiveness of medical devices that depend of them. In this work, we propose novel methods to evaluate electrophysiological signal quality to determine how much of the data represents the physiological source of interest. Data driven models are investigated through Bayesian decision and deep learning-based methods to score unimodal (signal and noise recorded on same device) and multimodal (signal and noise each recorded from different devices) data, respectively. We validate these methods and models on three electroencephalography (EEG) data sets (N = 60 subjects) to score EEG quality based on the presence of ocular artifacts with our unimodal method and motion artifacts with our multimodal method. Further, we apply our unimodal source method to compare the performance of two different artifact removal algorithms. Our results show we are able to effectively score EEG data using both methods and apply our method to evaluate the performance of other artifact removal algorithms that target ocular artifacts. Methods developed and validated here can be used to assess data quality and evaluate the effectiveness of certain noise-reduction algorithms.</p>

<p>Recently, several deep learning methods have been applied to decoding in task-related fMRI, and their advantages have been exploited in a variety of ways. However, this paradigm is sometimes problematic, due to the difficulty of applying deep learning to high-dimensional data and small sample size conditions. The difficulties in gathering a large amount of data to develop predictive machine learning models with multiple layers from fMRI experiments with complicated designs and tasks are well-recognized. Group-level, multi-voxel pattern analysis with small sample sizes results in low statistical power and large accuracy evaluation errors; failure in such instances is ascribed to the individual variability that risks information leakage, a particular issue when dealing with a limited number of subjects. In this study, using a small-size fMRI dataset evaluating bilingual language switch in a property generation task, we evaluated the relative fit of different deep learning models, incorporating moderate split methods to control the amount of information leakage. Our results indicated that using the session shuffle split as the data folding method, along with the multichannel 2D convolutional neural network (M2DCNN) classifier, recorded the best authentic classification accuracy, which outperformed the efficiency of 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN). In this manuscript, we discuss the tolerability of within-subject or within-session information leakage, of which the impact is generally considered small but complex and essentially unknown; this requires clarification in future studies.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate whether the effect of mental practice (motor imagery training) can be enhanced by providing neurofeedback based on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP). Twenty-four healthy, right-handed subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: a group that was given correct TMS feedback (Real-FB group) and a group that was given randomized false TMS feedback (Sham-FB group). The subjects imagined pushing the switch with just timing, when the target circle overlapped a cross at the center of the computer monitor. In the Real-FB group, feedback was provided to the subjects based on the MEP amplitude measured in the trial immediately preceding motor imagery. In contrast, the subjects of the Sham-FB group were provided with a feedback value that was independent of the MEP amplitude. TMS was applied when the target, moving from right to left, overlapped the cross at the center of the screen, and the MEP amplitude was measured. The MEP was recorded in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. We evaluated the pre-mental practice and post-mental practice motor performance in both groups. As a result, a significant difference was observed in the percentage change of error values between the Real-FB group and the Sham-FB group. Furthermore, the MEP was significantly different between the groups in the 4th and 5th sets. Therefore, it was suggested that TMS-induced MEP-based neurofeedback might enhance the effect of mental practice.</p>

<p>Pre-natal exposure to acute maternal trauma or chronic maternal distress can confer increased risk for psychiatric disorders in later life. Acute maternal trauma is the result of unforeseen environmental or personal catastrophes, while chronic maternal distress is associated with anxiety or depression. Animal studies investigating the effects of pre-natal stress have largely used brief stress exposures during pregnancy to identify critical periods of fetal vulnerability, a paradigm which holds face validity to acute maternal trauma in humans. While understanding these effects is undoubtably important, the literature suggests maternal stress in humans is typically chronic and persistent from pre-conception through gestation. In this review, we provide evidence to this effect and suggest a realignment of current animal models to recapitulate this chronicity. We also consider candidate mediators, moderators and mechanisms of maternal distress, and suggest a wider breadth of research is needed, along with the incorporation of advanced -omics technologies, in order to understand the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychiatric risk.</p>

<p>Virtual reality (VR) constitutes an alternative, effective, and increasingly utilized treatment option for people suffering from psychiatric and neurological illnesses. However, the currently available VR simulations provide a predetermined simulative framework that does not take into account the unique personality traits of each individual; this could result in inaccurate, extreme, or unpredictable responses driven by patients who may be overly exposed and in an abrupt manner to the predetermined stimuli, or result in indifferent, almost non-existing, reactions when the stimuli do not affect the patients adequately and thus stronger stimuli are recommended. In this study, we present a VR system that can recognize the individual differences and readjust the VR scenarios during the simulation according to the treatment aims. To investigate and present this dynamically adaptive VR system we employ an Anxiety Disorder condition as a case study, namely arachnophobia. This system consists of distinct anxiety states, aiming to dynamically modify the VR environment in such a way that it can keep the individual within a controlled, and appropriate for the therapy needs, anxiety state, which will be called “desired states” for the study. This happens by adjusting the VR stimulus, in real-time, according to the electrophysiological responses of each individual. These electrophysiological responses are collected by an external electrodermal activity biosensor that serves as a tracker of physiological changes. Thirty-six diagnosed arachnophobic individuals participated in a one-session trial. Participants were divided into two groups, the Experimental Group which was exposed to the proposed real-time adaptive virtual simulation, and the Control Group which was exposed to a pre-recorded static virtual simulation as proposed in the literature. These results demonstrate the proposed system’s ability to continuously construct an updated and adapted virtual environment that keeps the users within the appropriately chosen state (higher or lower intensity) for approximately twice the time compared to the pre-recorded static virtual simulation. Thus, such a system can increase the efficiency of VR stimulations for the treatment of central nervous system dysfunctions, as it provides numerically more controlled sessions without unexpected variations.</p>

<p>The capacity to produce and understand written language is a uniquely human skill that exists on a continuum, and foundational to other facets of human cognition. Multivariate classifiers based on support vector machines (SVM) have provided much insight into the networks underlying reading skill beyond what traditional univariate methods can tell us. Shallow models like SVM require large amounts of data, and this problem is compounded when functional connections, which increase exponentially with network size, are predictors of interest. Data reduction using independent component analyses (ICA) mitigates this problem, but conventionally assumes linear relationships. Multilayer feedforward networks, in contrast, readily find optimal low-dimensional encodings of complex patterns that include complex nonlinear or conditional relationships. Samples of poor and highly-skilled young readers were selected from two open access data sets using rhyming and mental multiplication tasks, respectively. Functional connectivity was computed for the rhyming task within a functionally-defined reading network and used to train multilayer feedforward classifier models to simultaneously associate functional connectivity patterns with lexicality (word vs. pseudoword) and reading skill (poor vs. highly-skilled). Classifiers identified validation set lexicality with significantly better than chance accuracy, and reading skill with near-ceiling accuracy. Critically, a series of replications used pre-trained rhyming-task models to classify reading skill from mental multiplication task participants' connectivity with near-ceiling accuracy. The novel deep learning approach presented here provides the clearest demonstration to date that reading-skill dependent functional connectivity within the reading network influences brain processing dynamics across cognitive domains.</p>

<p>The hippocampal place cell system in rodents has provided a major paradigm for the scientific investigation of memory function and dysfunction. Place cells have been observed in area CA1 of the hippocampus of both freely moving animals, and of head-fixed animals navigating in virtual reality environments. However, spatial coding in virtual reality preparations has been observed to be impaired. Here we show that the use of a real-world environment system for head-fixed mice, consisting of an air-floating track with proximal cues, provides some advantages over virtual reality systems for the study of spatial memory. We imaged the hippocampus of head-fixed mice injected with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s while they navigated circularly constrained or open environments on the floating platform. We observed consistent place tuning in a substantial fraction of cells despite the absence of distal visual cues. Place fields remapped when animals entered a different environment. When animals re-entered the same environment, place fields typically remapped over a time period of multiple days, faster than in freely moving preparations, but comparable with virtual reality. Spatial information rates were within the range observed in freely moving mice. Manifold analysis indicated that spatial information could be extracted from a low-dimensional subspace of the neural population dynamics. This is the first demonstration of place cells in head-fixed mice navigating on an air-lifted real-world platform, validating its use for the study of brain circuits involved in memory and affected by neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Recent advancements in cell engineering have succeeded in manipulating cell identity with the targeted overexpression of specific cell fate determining transcription factors in a process named transcriptional programming. Neurogenin2 (NGN2) is sufficient to instruct pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to acquire a neuronal identity when delivered with an integrating system, which arises some safety concerns for clinical applications. A non-integrating system based on modified messenger RNA (mmRNA) delivery method, represents a valuable alternative to lentiviral-based approaches. The ability of NGN2 mmRNA to instruct PSC fate change has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here we aimed at understanding whether the use of an NGN2 mmRNA-based approach combined with a miniaturized system, which allows a higher transfection efficiency in a cost-effective system, is able to drive human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) toward the neuronal lineage. We show that NGN2 mRNA alone is able to induce cell fate conversion. Surprisingly, the outcome cell population accounts for multiple phenotypes along the neural development trajectory. We found that this mixed population is mainly constituted by neural stem cells (45% ± 18 PAX6 positive cells) and neurons (38% ± 8 βIIITUBULIN positive cells) only when NGN2 is delivered as mmRNA. On the other hand, when the delivery system is lentiviral-based, both providing a constant expression of NGN2 or only a transient pulse, the outcome differentiated population is formed by a clear majority of neurons (88% ± 1 βIIITUBULIN positive cells). Altogether, our data confirm the ability of NGN2 to induce neuralization in hiPSCs and opens a new point of view in respect to the delivery system method when it comes to transcriptional programming applications.</p>

<p>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were often observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, which preceded the onset of motor symptoms. Neuropathology of PD has also been found in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Many studies have reported significant PD-related alterations of gut microbiota. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences of gut microbiota between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) across different geographical regions. We conducted a systematic online search for case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in patients with PD and HCs. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to access alterations in the abundance of certain microbiota families in PD. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis study. Our results showed significant lower abundance levels of Prevotellaceae (MD = −0.37, 95% CI = −0.62 to −0.11), Faecalibacterium (MD = −0.41, 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.24), and Lachnospiraceae (MD = −0.34, 95% CI = −0.59 to −0.09) in patients with PD compared to HCs. Significant higher abundance level of Bifidobacteriaceae (MD = 0.38, 95%; CI = 0.12 to 0.63), Ruminococcaceae (MD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.10), Verrucomicrobiaceae (MD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.69), and Christensenellaceae (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.34) was also found in patients with PD. Thus, shared alterations of certain gut microbiota were detected in patients with PD across different geographical regions. These PD-related gut microbiota dysbiosis might lead to the impairment of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing process, lipid metabolism, immunoregulatory function, and intestinal permeability, which contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.</p>

<p>A wide range of comorbid diseases is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Evidence from clinical and molecular studies suggest that chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease, may be associated with an increased risk of AD in different populations. Disruption in several shared biological pathways has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for the association between AD and these comorbidities. Notably, inflammation is a common dysregulated pathway shared by most of the comorbidities associated with AD. Some drugs commonly prescribed to patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease have shown promising results in AD patients. Systems-based biology studies have identified common genetic factors and dysregulated pathways that may explain the relationship of comorbid disorders in AD. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms for the occurrence of disease comorbidities in AD are not entirely understood. Here, we discuss the impact of the most common comorbidities in the clinical management of AD patients.</p>

<p>Introduction: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 32 kDa stress-response protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Biliverdin is derived from heme through a reaction mediated by HO-1 and protects cells from oxidative stress. However, iron and carbon monoxide produced by the catabolism of HO-1 exert detrimental effects on patients with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma HO-1 levels represent a biomarker of PD and to further explore the underlying mechanism of increased HO-1 levels by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM).Methods: We measured plasma HO-1 levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 156 subjects, including 81 patients with early- and advanced-stage PD and 75 subjects without PD. The analyses were adjusted to control for confounders such as age, sex, and medication. We analyzed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 74 patients with PD using VBM to elucidate the association between altered brain volumes and HO-1 levels. Then, we compared performance on MMSE sub-items between PD patients with low and high levels of HO-1 using Mann-Whitney U tests.Results: Plasma HO-1 levels were significantly elevated in PD patients, predominantly those with early-stage PD, compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05). The optimal cutoff value for patients with early PD was 2.245 ng/ml HO-1 [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.654]. Plasma HO-1 levels were unaffected by sex, age, and medications (p &gt; 0.05). The right hippocampal volume was decreased in the subset of PD patients with high HO-1 levels (p &lt; 0.05). A weak correlation was observed between right hippocampal volume and plasma HO-1 levels (r = −0.273, p = 0.018). There was no difference in total MMSE scores between the low- and high-HO-1 groups (p &gt; 0.05), but the high-HO-1 group had higher language scores than the low-HO-1 group (p &lt; 0.05).Conclusions: Plasma HO-1 levels may be a promising biomarker of early PD. Moreover, a high plasma concentration of the HO-1 protein is associated with a reduction in right hippocampal volume.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.585904">Body Temperature Is Associated With Cognitive Performance in Older Adults With and Without Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-sectional Analysis</a></h4>

<p>Wearable devices for remote and continuous health monitoring in older populations frequently include sensors for body temperature measurements (i.e., skin and core body temperatures). Healthy aging is associated with core body temperatures that are in the lower range of age-related normal values (36.3 ± 0.6°C, oral temperature), while patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibit core body temperatures above normal values (up to 0.2°C). However, the relation of body temperature measures with neurocognitive health in older adults remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the association of body temperature with cognitive performance in older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Eighty community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years) participated, of which 54 participants were cognitively healthy and 26 participants met the criteria for MCI. Skin temperatures at the rib cage and the scapula were measured in the laboratory (single-point measurement) and neuropsychological tests were conducted to assess general cognitive performance, episodic memory, verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. In a subgroup (n = 15, nine healthy, six MCI), skin and core body temperatures were measured continuously during 12 h of habitual daily activities (long-term measurement). Spearman’s partial correlation analyses, controlled for age, revealed that lower median body temperature and higher peak-to-peak body temperature amplitude was associated with better general cognitive performance and with better performance in specific domains of cognition; [e.g., rib median skin temperature (single-point) vs. processing speed: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.33, p = 0.002; rib median skin temperature (long-term) vs. executive function: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.56, p = 0.023; and peak-to-peak core body temperature amplitude (long-term) vs. episodic memory: r<sub>s</sub> = 0.51, p = 0.032]. Additionally, cognitively healthy older adults showed lower median body temperature and higher peak-to-peak body temperature amplitude compared to older adults with MCI (e.g., rib median skin temperature, single-point: p = 0.035, r = 0.20). We conclude that both skin and core body temperature measures are potential early biomarkers of cognitive decline and preclinical symptoms of MCI/AD. It may therefore be promising to integrate body temperature measures into multi-parameter systems for the remote and continuous monitoring of neurocognitive health in older adults.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65552">Precise base editing for the in vivo study of developmental signaling and human pathologies in zebrafish</a></h4>

While zebrafish is emerging as a new model system to study human diseases, an efficient methodology to generate precise point mutations at high efficiency is still lacking. Here we show that base editors can generate C-to-T point mutations with high efficiencies without other unwanted on-target mutations. In addition, we established a new editor variant recognizing an NAA PAM, expanding the base editing possibilities in zebrafish. Using these approaches, we first generated a base change in the <i>ctnnb1</i> gene, mimicking oncogenic mutations of the human gene known to result in constitutive activation of endogenous Wnt signaling. Additionally, we precisely targeted several cancer-associated genes including <i>cbl</i>. With this last target we created a new zebrafish dwarfism model. Together our findings expand the potential of zebrafish as a model system allowing new approaches for the endogenous modulation of cell signaling pathways and the generation of precise models of human genetic disease associated-mutations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64061">Basis of specificity for a conserved and promiscuous chromatin remodeling protein</a></h4>

Eukaryotic genomes are organized dynamically through the repositioning of nucleosomes. Isw2 is an enzyme that has been previously defined as a genome-wide, non-specific nucleosome spacing factor. Here, we show that Isw2 instead acts as an obligately targeted nucleosome remodeler <i>in vivo </i>through physical interactions with sequence-specific factors. We demonstrate that Isw2- recruiting factors use small and previously uncharacterized epitopes, which direct Isw2 activity through highly conserved acidic residues in the Isw2 accessory protein Itc1. This interaction orients Isw2 on target nucleosomes, allowing for precise nucleosome positioning at targeted loci. Finally, we show that these critical acidic residues have been lost in the <i>Drosophila </i>lineage, potentially explaining the inconsistently characterized function of Isw2-like proteins. Altogether, these data suggest an 'interacting barrier model' where Isw2 interacts with a sequence-specific factor to accurately and reproducibly position a single, targeted nucleosome to define the precise border of phased chromatin arrays.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61279">Cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity are preserved in a mouse model of cerebral microvascular amyloidosis</a></h4>

Impaired cerebrovascular function is an early biomarker for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a neurovascular disease characterized by amyloid-β accumulation in the cerebral vasculature, leading to stroke and dementia. The transgenic Swedish Dutch Iowa (Tg-SwDI) mouse model develops cerebral microvascular amyloid-β deposits, but whether this leads to similar functional impairments is incompletely understood. We assessed cerebrovascular function longitudinally in Tg-SwDI mice with arterial spin labeling (ASL)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) over the course of amyloid-β deposition. Unexpectedly, Tg-SwDI mice showed similar baseline perfusion and cerebrovascular reactivity estimates as age-matched wild-type control mice, irrespective of modality (ASL or LDF) or anesthesia (isoflurane or urethane and α-chloralose). Hemodynamic changes were, however, observed as an effect of age and anesthesia. Our findings contradict earlier results obtained in the same model and question to what extent microvascular amyloidosis as seen in Tg-SwDI mice is representative of cerebrovascular dysfunction observed in CAA patients.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60607">BipA exerts temperature-dependent translational control of biofilm-associated colony morphology in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i></a></h4>

Adaptation to shifting temperatures is crucial for the survival of the bacterial pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we show that colony rugosity, a biofilm-associated phenotype, is regulated by temperature in <i>V. cholerae</i> strains that naturally lack the master biofilm transcriptional regulator HapR. Using transposon-insertion mutagenesis, we found the <i>V. cholerae</i> ortholog of BipA, a conserved ribosome-associated GTPase, is critical for this temperature-dependent phenomenon. Proteomic analyses revealed that loss of BipA alters the synthesis of &gt;300 proteins in <i>V. cholerae</i> at 22°C, increasing the production of biofilm-related proteins including the key transcriptional activators VpsR and VpsT, as well as proteins important for diverse cellular processes. At low temperatures, BipA protein levels increase and are required for optimal ribosome assembly in <i>V. cholerae</i>, suggesting that control of BipA abundance is a mechanism by which bacteria can remodel their proteomes. Our study reveals a remarkable new facet of <i>V. cholerae</i>’s complex biofilm regulatory network.

MIGNON is a workflow for the analysis of RNA-Seq experiments, which not only efficiently manages the estimation of gene expression levels from raw sequencing reads, but also calls genomic variants present in the transcripts analyzed. Moreover, this is the first workflow that provides a framework for the integration of transcriptomic and genomic data based on a mechanistic model of signaling pathway activities that allows a detailed biological interpretation of the results, including a comprehensive functional profiling of cell activity. MIGNON covers the whole process, from reads to signaling circuit activity estimations, using state-of-the-art tools, it is easy to use and it is deployable in different computational environments, allowing an optimized use of the resources available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lbrtDEw9EwA" width="1" />

<p>by Pablo Rodríguez-Mier, Nathalie Poupin, Carlo de Blasio, Laurent Le Cam, Fabien Jourdan</p>

The correct identification of metabolic activity in tissues or cells under different conditions can be extremely elusive due to mechanisms such as post-transcriptional modification of enzymes or different rates in protein degradation, making difficult to perform predictions on the basis of gene expression alone. Context-specific metabolic network reconstruction can overcome some of these limitations by leveraging the integration of multi-omics data into genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN). Using the experimental information, context-specific models are reconstructed by extracting from the generic GSMN the sub-network most consistent with the data, subject to biochemical constraints. One advantage is that these context-specific models have more predictive power since they are tailored to the specific tissue, cell or condition, containing only the reactions predicted to be active in such context. However, an important limitation is that there are usually many different sub-networks that optimally fit the experimental data. This set of optimal networks represent alternative explanations of the possible metabolic state. Ignoring the set of possible solutions reduces the ability to obtain relevant information about the metabolism and may bias the interpretation of the true metabolic states. In this work we formalize the problem of enumerating optimal metabolic networks and we introduce DEXOM, an unified approach for diversity-based enumeration of context-specific metabolic networks. We developed different strategies for this purpose and we performed an exhaustive analysis using simulated and real data. In order to analyze the extent to which these results are biologically meaningful, we used the alternative solutions obtained with the different methods to measure: 1) the improvement of in silico predictions of essential genes in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> using ensembles of metabolic network; and 2) the detection of alternative enriched pathways in different human cancer cell lines. We also provide DEXOM as an open-source library compatible with COBRA Toolbox 3.0, available at https://github.com/MetExplore/dexom.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v2GUBLx6oK4" width="1" />

<p>by Hwai-Ray Tung, Rick Durrett</p>

Recent work of Sottoriva, Graham, and collaborators have led to the controversial claim that exponentially growing tumors have a site frequency spectrum that follows the 1/<i>f</i> law consistent with neutral evolution. This conclusion has been criticized based on data quality issues, statistical considerations, and simulation results. Here, we use rigorous mathematical arguments to investigate the site frequency spectrum in the two-type model of clonal evolution. If the fitnesses of the two types are λ<sub>0</sub> &lt; λ<sub>1</sub>, then the site frequency spectrum is <i>c</i>/<i>f</i><sup>α</sup> where <i>α</i> = λ<sub>0</sub>/λ<sub>1</sub>. This is due to the advantageous mutations that produce the founders of the type 1 population. Mutations within the growing type 0 and type 1 populations follow the 1/<i>f</i> law. Our results show that, in contrast to published criticisms, neutral evolution in an exponentially growing tumor can be distinguished from the two-type model using the site frequency spectrum.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JjBq4PnRsds" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin Gallois, Raphaël Candelier</p>

Analyzing the dynamical properties of mobile objects requires to extract trajectories from recordings, which is often done by tracking movies. We compiled a database of two-dimensional movies for very different biological and physical systems spanning a wide range of length scales and developed a general-purpose, optimized, open-source, cross-platform, easy to install and use, self-updating software called FastTrack. It can handle a changing number of deformable objects in a region of interest, and is particularly suitable for animal and cell tracking in two-dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the probability of incursions as a new measure of a movie’s trackability that doesn’t require the knowledge of ground truth trajectories, since it is resilient to small amounts of errors and can be computed on the basis of an <i>ad hoc</i> tracking. We also leveraged the versatility and speed of FastTrack to implement an iterative algorithm determining a set of nearly-optimized tracking parameters—yet further reducing the amount of human intervention—and demonstrate that FastTrack can be used to explore the space of tracking parameters to optimize the number of swaps for a batch of similar movies. A benchmark shows that FastTrack is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, with a comparable tracking accuracy.

<p>by Yusuke Himeoka, Namiko Mitarai</p>

Prolonged lag time can be induced by starvation contributing to the antibiotic tolerance of bacteria. We analyze the optimal lag time to survive and grow the iterative and stochastic application of antibiotics. A simple model shows that the optimal lag time can exhibit a discontinuous transition when the severeness of the antibiotic application, such as the probability to be exposed the antibiotic, the death rate under the exposure, and the duration of the exposure, is increased. This suggests the possibility of reducing tolerant bacteria by controlled usage of antibiotics application. When the bacterial populations are able to have two phenotypes with different lag times, the fraction of the second phenotype that has different lag time shows a continuous transition. We then present a generic framework to investigate the optimal lag time distribution for total population fitness for a given distribution of the antibiotic application duration. The obtained optimal distributions have multiple peaks for a wide range of the antibiotic application duration distributions, including the case where the latter is monotonically decreasing. The analysis supports the advantage in evolving multiple, possibly discrete phenotypes in lag time for bacterial long-term fitness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q02rylL_KyQ" width="1" />

<p>by Constanze Ciavarella, Neil M. Ferguson</p>

The spatial dynamics of epidemics are fundamentally affected by patterns of human mobility. Mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) are a rich source of mobility data, and allow semi-mechanistic models of movement to be parameterised even for resource poor settings. While the gravity model typically reproduces human movement reasonably well at the administrative level spatial scale, past studies suggest that parameter estimates vary with the level of spatial discretisation at which models are fitted. Given that privacy concerns usually preclude public release of very fine-scale movement data, such variation would be problematic for individual-based simulations of epidemic spread parametrised at a fine spatial scale. We therefore present new methods to fit fine-scale mathematical mobility models (here we implement variants of the gravity and radiation models) to spatially aggregated movement data and investigate how model parameter estimates vary with spatial resolution. We use gridded population data at 1km resolution to derive population counts at different spatial scales (down to ∼ 5km grids) and implement mobility models at each scale. Parameters are estimated from administrative-level flow data between overnight locations in Kenya and Namibia derived from CDRs: where the model spatial resolution exceeds that of the mobility data, we compare the flow data between a particular origin and destination with the sum of all model flows between cells that lie within those particular origin and destination administrative units. Clear evidence of over-dispersion supports the use of negative binomial instead of Poisson likelihood for count data with high values. Radiation models use fewer parameters than the gravity model and better predict trips between overnight locations for both considered countries. Results show that estimates for some parameters change between countries and with spatial resolution and highlight how imperfect flow data and spatial population distribution can influence model fit.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4RXwWBH3_cY" width="1" />

One of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-dx0oGr514M" width="1" />

<p>by Marc A. Dämgen, Philip C. Biggin</p>

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are receptor proteins that are sensitive to their membrane environment, but the mechanism for how lipids modulate function under physiological conditions in a state dependent manner is not known. The glycine receptor is a pLGIC whose structure has been resolved in different functional states. Using a realistic model of a neuronal membrane coupled with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that some key lipid-protein interactions are dependent on the receptor state, suggesting that lipids may regulate the receptor’s conformational dynamics. Comparison with existing structural data confirms known lipid binding sites, but we also predict further protein-lipid interactions including a site at the communication interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domain. Moreover, in the active state, cholesterol can bind to the binding site of the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. These protein-lipid interaction sites could in future be exploited for the rational design of lipid-like allosteric drugs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dtFHrIa3xVo" width="1" />

Objective
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still burdened by high mortality in a subset of patients, such as those affected by hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and carry out preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of polyomavirus JC (JCPyV)‐specific T cell therapy in a cohort of hematological patients with PML.


Methods
Between 2014 and 2019, 9 patients with a diagnosis of “definite PML” according to the 2013 consensus who were showing progressive clinical deterioration received JCPyV‐specific T cells. Cell lines were expanded from autologous or allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with JCPyV antigen‐derived peptides.


Results
None of the patients experienced treatment‐related adverse events. In the evaluable patients, an increase in the frequency of circulating JCPyV‐specific lymphocytes was observed, with a decrease or clearance of JCPyV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. In responsive patients, transient appearance of punctate areas of contrast enhancement within, or close to, PML lesions was observed, which was interpreted as a sign of immune control and which regressed spontaneously without the need for steroid treatment. Six of 9 patients achieved PML control, with 5 alive and in good clinical condition at their last follow‐up.


Interpretation
Among other novel treatments, T cell therapy is emerging as a viable treatment option in patients with PML, particularly for those not amenable to restoration of specific immunity. Neurologists should be encouraged to refer PML patients to specialized centers to allow access to this treatment strategy. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>Recurrent neural networks are a powerful means in diverse applications. We
show that, together with so-called conceptors, they also allow fast learning,
in contrast to other deep learning methods. In addition, a relatively small
number of examples suffices to train neural networks with high accuracy. We
demonstrate this with two applications, namely speech recognition and detecting
car driving maneuvers. We improve the state-of-the art by application-specific
preparation techniques: For speech recognition, we use mel frequency cepstral
coefficients leading to a compact representation of the frequency spectra, and
detecting car driving maneuvers can be done without the commonly used
polynomial interpolation, as our evaluation suggests.

<p>Learning to detect content-independent transformations from data is one of
the central problems in biological and artificial intelligence. An example of
such problem is unsupervised learning of a visual motion detector from pairs of
consecutive video frames. Rao and Ruderman formulated this problem in terms of
learning infinitesimal transformation operators (Lie group generators) via
minimizing image reconstruction error. Unfortunately, it is difficult to map
their model onto a biologically plausible neural network (NN) with local
learning rules. Here we propose a biologically plausible model of motion
detection. We also adopt the transformation-operator approach but, instead of
reconstruction-error minimization, start with a similarity-preserving objective
function. An online algorithm that optimizes such an objective function
naturally maps onto an NN with biologically plausible learning rules. The
trained NN recapitulates major features of the well-studied motion detector in
the fly. In particular, it is consistent with the experimental observation that
local motion detectors combine information from at least three adjacent pixels,
something that contradicts the celebrated Hassenstein-Reichardt model.

<p>The development of neuromorphic hardware and modeling of biological neural
networks requires algorithms with local learning rules. Artificial neural
networks using local learning rules to perform principal subspace analysis
(PSA) and clustering have recently been derived from principled objective
functions. However, no biologically plausible networks exist for minor subspace
analysis (MSA), a fundamental signal processing task. MSA extracts the
lowest-variance subspace of the input signal covariance matrix. Here, we
introduce a novel similarity matching objective for extracting the minor
subspace, Minor Subspace Similarity Matching (MSSM). Moreover, we derive an
adaptive MSSM algorithm that naturally maps onto a novel neural network with
local learning rules and gives numerical results showing that our method
converges at a competitive rate.

<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art algorithms for
the processing of images. However the configuration and training of these
networks is a complex task requiring deep domain knowledge, experience and much
trial and error. Using genetic algorithms, competitive CNN topologies for image
recognition can be produced for any specific purpose, however in previous work
this has come at high computational cost. In this work two novel approaches are
presented to the utilisation of these algorithms, effective in reducing
complexity and training time by nearly 20%. This is accomplished via
regularisation directly on training time, and the use of partial training to
enable early ranking of individual architectures. Both approaches are validated
on the benchmark CIFAR10 data set, and maintain accuracy.

<p>Pruning is one of the major methods to compress deep neural networks. In this
paper, we propose an Ising energy model within an optimization framework for
pruning convolutional kernels and hidden units. This model is designed to
reduce redundancy between weight kernels and detect inactive kernels/hidden
units. Our experiments using ResNets, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 datasets show that the proposed method on average can achieve a
pruning rate of more than $50\%$ of the trainable parameters with approximately
$&lt;10\%$ and $&lt;5\%$ drop of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy,
respectively.

<p>Black-box optimization is a very active area of research, with many new
algorithms being developed every year. This variety is needed, on the one hand,
since different algorithms are most suitable for different types of
optimization problems. But the variety also poses a meta-problem: which
algorithm to choose for a given problem at hand? Past research has shown that
per-instance algorithm selection based on exploratory landscape analysis (ELA)
can be an efficient mean to tackle this meta-problem. Existing approaches,
however, require the approximation of problem features based on a significant
number of samples, which are typically selected through uniform sampling or
Latin Hypercube Designs. The evaluation of these points is costly, and the
benefit of an ELA-based algorithm selection over a default algorithm must
therefore be significant in order to pay off. One could hope to by-pass the
evaluations for the feature approximations by using the samples that a default
algorithm would anyway perform, i.e., by using the points of the default
algorithm's trajectory.
</p>
<p>We analyze in this paper how well such an approach can work. Concretely, we
test how accurately trajectory-based ELA approaches can predict the final
solution quality of the CMA-ES after a fixed budget of function evaluations. We
observe that the loss of trajectory-based predictions can be surprisingly small
compared to the classical global sampling approach, if the remaining budget for
which solution quality shall be predicted is not too large. Feature selection,
in contrast, did not show any advantage in our experiments and rather led to
worsened prediction accuracy. The inclusion of state variables of CMA-ES only

<p>In the recent sleep studies, it was shown that afferentation of many cortical areas switches during sleep to the interoceptive one. However, it was unclear whether the insular cortex, which is often considered as the main cortical visceral representation, maintains the same effective connectivity in both states of vigilance, or processes interoceptive information predominantly in one state. We investigated neuronal responses of the cat insular cortex to electrical stimulations of the intestinal wall delivered during wakefulness and natural sleep. Marked increase was observed in the number of insular neurons responding to this stimulation in sleep comparing to wakefulness, and enlarged amplitudes of evoked local field potentials were found as well. Moreover, most of the cells responding to intestinal stimulation in wakefulness never responded to identical stimuli during sleep and vice versa. It was also shown that applied low intensity intestinal stimulations had never compromised sleep quality. In addition, experiments with microstimulation of the insular cortex and recording of intestinal myoelectric activity demonstrated that effective insula-to-gut propagation also happened only during sleep. On the other hand, the same insular stimulations in wakefulness led to contractions of orofacial muscles. The evoked face movements gradually disappeared in the course of sleep development. These findings demonstrate that pattern of efficient afferent and efferent connections of the insular cortex changes with transition from wakefulness to sleep.</p>

Background<p>Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are two major pathological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β oligomers (AβO), a toxic form of Aβ, promote the neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the development of AD. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural flavonoid isolated from the root of liquorice, has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on inflammatory response and oxidative stress.</p>Objectives<p>The main purpose of this study is to assess the influence of ISL on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in BV2 cells stimulated with AβO, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>Methods<p>3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assays were used to assess the toxic or protective effects of ISL. The expression levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Morphological changes in BV2 cells were assessed by immunofluorescence method. Nitric oxide (NO) assay kit was used to determinate the NO production. Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>Results<p>ISL treatment reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO, and alleviated the morphological changes in BV2 cells induced by AβO. ISL treatment further protected N2a cells from the toxic medium of AβO-stimulated BV2 cells. ISL activated nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling and suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in BV2 cells.</p>Conclusion<p>ISL suppresses AβO-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in BV2 cells via the regulation of Nrf2/NF-κB signaling. Therefore, ISL indirectly protects neurons from the damage of toxic conditioned media.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging of hippocampal internal architecture (HIA) at 3T is challenging. HIA is defined by layers of gray and white matter that are less than 1 mm thick in the coronal plane. To visualize HIA, conventional MRI approaches have relied on sequences with high in-plane resolution (≤0.5 mm) but comparatively thick slices (2–5 mm). However, thicker slices are prone to volume averaging effects that result in loss of HIA clarity and blurring of the borders of the hippocampal subfields in up to 61% of slices as has been reported. In this work we describe an approach to hippocampal imaging that provides consistently high HIA clarity using a commonly available sequence and post-processing techniques that is flexible and may be applicable to any MRI platform. We refer to this approach as High Resolution Multiple Image Co-registration and Averaging (HR-MICRA). This approach uses a variable flip angle turbo spin echo sequence to repeatedly acquire a whole brain T2w image volume with high resolution in three dimensions in a relatively short amount of time, and then co-register the volumes to correct for movement and average the repeated scans to improve SNR. We compared the averages of 4, 9, and 16 individual scans in 20 healthy controls using a published HIA clarity rating scale. In the body of the hippocampus, the proportion of slices with good or excellent HIA clarity was 90%, 83%, and 67% for the 16x, 9x, and 4x HR-MICRA images, respectively. Using the 4x HR-MICRA images as a baseline, the 9x HR-MICRA images were 2.6 times and 16x HR-MICRA images were 3.2 times more likely to have high HIA ratings (p &lt; 0.001) across all hippocampal segments (head, body, and tail). The thin slices of the HR-MICRA images allow reformatting in any plane with clear visualization of hippocampal dentation in the sagittal plane. Clear and consistent visualization of HIA will allow application of this technique to future hippocampal structure research, as well as more precise manual or automated segmentation.</p>

Purpose<p>Childhood onset speech fluency disorder (stuttering) is possibly related to dopaminergic dysfunction. Mesencephalic hyperechogenicity (ME) detected by transcranial ultrasound (TCS) might be seen as an indirect marker of dopaminergic dysfunction. We here determined whether adults who stutter since childhood (AWS) show ME.</p>Methods<p>We performed TCS in ten AWS and ten matched adults who never stuttered. We also assessed motor performance in finger tapping and in the 25 Foot Walking test.</p>Results<p>Compared to controls, AWS showed enlarged ME on either side. Finger tapping was slower in AWS. Walking cadence, i.e., the ratio of number of steps by time, tended to be higher in AWS than in control participants.</p>Discussion<p>The results demonstrate a motor deficit in AWS linked to dopaminergic dysfunction and extending beyond speech. Since iron deposits evolve in childhood and shrink thereafter, ME might serve as an easily quantifiable biomarker helping to predict the risk of persistency in children who stutter.</p>

<p>Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms. The ideal site for implantation within STN, however, remains controversial. While many argue that placement of a DBS lead within the sensorimotor territory of the STN yields better motor outcomes, others report similar effects with leads placed in the associative or motor territory of the STN, while still others assert that placing a DBS lead “anywhere within a 6-mm-diameter cylinder centered at the presumed middle of the STN (based on stereotactic atlas coordinates) produces similar clinical efficacy.” These discrepancies likely result from methodological differences including targeting preferences, imaging acquisition and the use of brain atlases that do not account for patient-specific anatomic variability. We present a first-in-kind within-patient demonstration of severe mood side effects and minimal motor improvement in a Parkinson’s disease patient following placement of a DBS lead in the limbic/associative territory of the STN who experienced marked improvement in motor benefit and resolution of mood side effects following repositioning the lead within the STN sensorimotor territory. 7 Tesla (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were used to generate a patient-specific anatomical model of the STN with parcellation into distinct functional territories and computational modeling to assess the relative degree of activation of motor, associative and limbic territories.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.615313">The Neural Correlates of Cued Reward Omission</a></h4>

<p>Compared to our understanding of positive prediction error signals occurring due to unexpected reward outcomes, less is known about the neural circuitry in humans that drives negative prediction errors during omission of expected rewards. While classical learning theories such as Rescorla–Wagner or temporal difference learning suggest that both types of prediction errors result from a simple subtraction, there has been recent evidence suggesting that different brain regions provide input to dopamine neurons which contributes to specific components of this prediction error computation. Here, we focus on the brain regions responding to negative prediction error signals, which has been well-established in animal studies to involve a distinct pathway through the lateral habenula. We examine the activity of this pathway in humans, using a conditioned inhibition paradigm with high-resolution functional MRI. First, participants learned to associate a sensory stimulus with reward delivery. Then, reward delivery was omitted whenever this stimulus was presented simultaneously with a different sensory stimulus, the conditioned inhibitor (CI). Both reward presentation and the reward-predictive cue activated midbrain dopamine regions, insula and orbitofrontal cortex. While we found significant activity at an uncorrected threshold for the CI in the habenula, consistent with our predictions, it did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and awaits further replication. Additionally, the pallidum and putamen regions of the basal ganglia showed modulations of activity for the inhibitor that did not survive the corrected threshold.</p>

<p>Opioid use disorder (OUD) rarely presents as a unitary psychiatric condition, and the comorbid symptoms likely depend upon the diverse risk factors and mechanisms by which OUD can arise. These factors are heterogeneous and include genetic predisposition, exposure to prescription opioids, and environmental risks. Crucially, one key environmental risk factor for OUD is early life adversity (ELA). OUD and other substance use disorders are widely considered to derive in part from abnormal reward circuit function, which is likely also implicated in comorbid mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. ELA may disrupt reward circuit development and function in a manner predisposing to these disorders. Here, we describe new findings addressing the effects of ELA on reward circuitry that lead to OUD and comorbid disorders, potentially via shared neural mechanisms. We discuss some of these OUD-related problems in both humans and animals. We also highlight the increasingly apparent, crucial contribution of biological sex in mediating the range of ELA-induced disruptions of reward circuitry which may confer risk for the development of OUD and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>The entorhino-dentate projection, i.e., the perforant pathway, terminates in a highly ordered and laminated fashion in the rodent dentate gyrus (DG): fibers arising from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) terminate in the middle molecular layer, whereas fibers arising from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) terminate in the outer molecular layer of the DG. In rats and rabbits, a crossed entorhino-dentate projection exists, which originates from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and terminates in the contralateral DG. In contrast, in mice, such a crossed projection is reportedly absent. Using single and double mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures, we studied the ipsi- and crossed entorhino-dentate projections. Viral tracing revealed that entorhino-dentate projections terminate with a high degree of lamina-specificity in single as well as in double cultures. Furthermore, in double cultures, entorhinal axons arising from one slice freely intermingled with entorhinal axons originating from the other slice. In single as well as in double cultures, entorhinal axons exhibited a correct topographical projection to the DG: medial entorhinal axons terminated in the middle and lateral entorhinal axons terminated in the outer molecular layer. Finally, entorhinal neurons were virally transduced with Channelrhodopsin2-YFP and stimulated with light, revealing functional connections between the EC and dentate granule cells. We conclude from our findings that entorhino-dentate projections form bilaterally in the mouse hippocampus in vitro and that the mouse DG provides a permissive environment for crossed entorhinal fibers.</p>

<p>Objectives: To characterize the clinical correlates of subclinical Parkinsonian signs, including longitudinal cognitive and neural (via functional connectivity) outcomes, among functionally normal older adults.</p><p>Methods: Participants included 737 functionally intact community-dwelling older adults who performed prospective comprehensive evaluations at ~15-months intervals for an average of 4.8 years (standard deviation 3.2 years). As part of these evaluations, participants completed the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) longitudinally and measures of processing speed, executive functioning and verbal episodic memory.

We conducted linear mixed-effects models to determine the relationship between changes in UPDRS with cognitive and neural changes, using age, sex, and education as covariates.</p><p>Results: Cognitive outcomes were processing speed, executive functioning, and episodic memory. Greater within-person increases in UPDRS were associated with more cognitive slowing over time. Although higher average UPDRS scores were significantly associated with overall poorer executive functions, there was no association between UPDRS and executive functioning longitudinally. UPDRS scores did not significantly relate to longitudinal memory performances. Regarding neural correlates, greater increases in UPDRS scores were associated with reduced intra-subcortical network connectivity over time. There were no relationships with intra-frontoparietal or inter-subcortical-frontoparietal connectivity.</p><p>Conclusions: Our findings add to the aging literature by indicating that mild motor changes are negatively associated with cognition and network connectivity in functionally intact adults.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65365">The Spike D614G mutation increases SARS-CoV-2 infection of multiple human cell types</a></h4>

A novel variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type human codon optimized Spike to introduce the D614G variant. Using multiple human cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, we found that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Spike D614G are more effective at transducing cells than ones pseudotyped with wild-type Spike. The increased transduction with Spike D614G ranged from 1.3 to 2.4-fold in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells expressing endogenous ACE2, and 1.5 to 7.7-fold in A549<sup>ACE2</sup> and Huh7.5<sup>ACE2</sup> overexpressing ACE2. Furthermore, <i>trans</i>-complementation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Spike D614G showed an increased infectivity of human cells. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the D614 and G614 Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63586">The allosteric modulation of Complement C5 by knob domain peptides</a></h4>

Bovines have evolved a subset of antibodies with ultra-long CDRH3 regions that harbour cysteine-rich knob domains. To produce high affinity peptides, we previously isolated autonomous 3-6 kDa knob domains from bovine antibodies. Here, we show that binding of four knob domain peptides elicits a range of effects on the clinically validated drug target complement C5. Allosteric mechanisms predominated, with one peptide selectively inhibiting C5 cleavage by the alternative pathway C5 convertase, revealing a targetable mechanistic difference between the classical and alternative pathway C5 convertases. Taking a hybrid biophysical approach, we present C5-knob domain co-crystal structures and, by solution methods, observed allosteric effects propagating &gt;50 Å from the binding sites. This study expands the therapeutic scope of C5, presents new inhibitors and introduces knob domains as new, low molecular weight antibody fragments, with therapeutic potential.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63379">Transsynaptic mapping of <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body output neurons</a></h4>

The mushroom body (MB) is a well-characterized associative memory structure within the <i>Drosophila</i> brain. Analyzing MB connectivity using multiple approaches is critical for understanding the functional implications of this structure. Using the genetic anterograde transsynaptic tracing tool, <i>trans-</i>Tango, we identified divergent projections across the brain and convergent downstream targets of the MB output neurons (MBONs). Our analysis revealed at least three separate targets that receive convergent input from MBONs: other MBONs, the fan-shaped body (FSB), and the lateral accessory lobe (LAL). We describe, both anatomically and functionally, a multilayer circuit in which inhibitory and excitatory MBONs converge on the same genetic subset of FSB and LAL neurons. This circuit architecture enables the brain to update and integrate information with previous experience before executing appropriate behavioral responses. Our use of <i>trans</i>-Tango provides a genetically accessible anatomical framework for investigating the functional relevance of components within these complex and interconnected circuits.

<p>by Yuanhong Tang, Lingling An, Ye Yuan, Qingqi Pei, Quan Wang, Jian K. Liu</p>

The dynamics of cerebellar neuronal networks is controlled by the underlying building blocks of neurons and synapses between them. For which, the computation of Purkinje cells (PCs), the only output cells of the cerebellar cortex, is implemented through various types of neural pathways interactively routing excitation and inhibition converged to PCs. Such tuning of excitation and inhibition, coming from the gating of specific pathways as well as short-term plasticity (STP) of the synapses, plays a dominant role in controlling the PC dynamics in terms of firing rate and spike timing. PCs receive cascade feedforward inputs from two major neural pathways: the first one is the feedforward excitatory pathway from granule cells (GCs) to PCs; the second one is the feedforward inhibition pathway from GCs, via molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), to PCs. The GC-PC pathway, together with short-term dynamics of excitatory synapses, has been a focus over past decades, whereas recent experimental evidence shows that MLIs also greatly contribute to controlling PC activity. Therefore, it is expected that the diversity of excitation gated by STP of GC-PC synapses, modulated by strong inhibition from MLI-PC synapses, can promote the computation performed by PCs. However, it remains unclear how these two neural pathways are interacted to modulate PC dynamics. Here using a computational model of PC network installed with these two neural pathways, we addressed this question to investigate the change of PC firing dynamics at the level of single cell and network. We show that the nonlinear characteristics of excitatory STP dynamics can significantly modulate PC spiking dynamics mediated by inhibition. The changes in PC firing rate, firing phase, and temporal spike pattern, are strongly modulated by these two factors in different ways. MLIs mainly contribute to variable delays in the postsynaptic action potentials of PCs while modulated by excitation STP. Notably, the diversity of synchronization and pause response in the PC network is governed not only by the balance of excitation and inhibition, but also by the synaptic STP, depending on input burst patterns. Especially, the pause response shown in the PC network can only emerge with the interaction of both pathways. Together with other recent findings, our results show that the interaction of feedforward pathways of excitation and inhibition, incorporated with synaptic short-term dynamics, can dramatically regulate the PC activities that consequently change the network dynamics of the cerebellar circuit.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vctWaRe4AhQ" width="1" />

Optogenetic targeting of astrocytes provides a robust experimental model to differentially induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes <i>in vivo</i>. However, a systematic study quantifying the response of optogenetically modified astrocytes to light is yet to be performed. Here, we propose a novel stochastic model of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in astrocytes that incorporates a light sensitive component—channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2). Utilizing this model, we investigated the effect of different light stimulation paradigms on cells expressing select variants of ChR2 (wild type, ChETA, and ChRET/TC). Results predict that depending on paradigm specification, astrocytes might undergo drastic changes in their basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and spiking probability. Furthermore, we performed a global sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of variation in parameters pertinent to the shape of the ChR2 photocurrent on astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Results suggest that directing variants towards the first open state of the ChR2 photocycle (o<sub>1</sub>) enhances spiking activity in astrocytes during optical stimulation. Evaluation of the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and coupling coefficient in a network of ChR2-expressing astrocytes demonstrated basal level elevations in the stimulated region and propagation of calcium activity to unstimulated cells. Buffering reduced the diffusion range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the network, thereby limiting propagation and influencing the activity of astrocytes. Collectively, the framework presented in this study provides valuable information for the selection of light stimulation paradigms that elicit desired astrocytic activity using existing ChR2 constructs, as well as aids in the engineering of future application-oriented optogenetic variants.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mC1SkbAKXg4" width="1" />

<p>by Ronan F. Arthur, James H. Jones, Matthew H. Bonds, Yoav Ram, Marcus W. Feldman</p>

Epidemics may pose a significant dilemma for governments and individuals. The personal or public health consequences of inaction may be catastrophic; but the economic consequences of drastic response may likewise be catastrophic. In the face of these trade-offs, governments and individuals must therefore strike a balance between the economic and personal health costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to do so. As risk of infection increases, potentially infectious contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by decree. This must be balanced against the social and economic costs of having fewer people in contact, and therefore active in the labor force or enrolled in school. Although the importance of adaptive social contact on epidemic outcomes has become increasingly recognized, the most important properties of coupled human-natural epidemic systems are still not well understood. We develop a theoretical model for adaptive, optimal control of the effective social contact rate using traditional epidemic modeling tools and a utility function with delayed information. This utility function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple discrete-time deterministic strategic model reveals the existence of an endemic equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive behavior change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated dynamics. Implications for any epidemic in which adaptive behavior influences infectious disease dynamics include an expectation of fluctuations, for a considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8TBkScHy6-w" width="1" />

Different miRNA profiling protocols and technologies introduce differences in the resulting quantitative expression profiles. These include differences in the presence (and measurability) of certain miRNAs. We present and examine a method based on quantile normalization, Adjusted Quantile Normalization (AQuN), to combine miRNA expression data from multiple studies in breast cancer into a single joint dataset for integrative analysis. By pooling multiple datasets, we obtain increased statistical power, surfacing patterns that do not emerge as statistically significant when separately analyzing these datasets. To merge several datasets, as we do here, one needs to overcome both technical and batch differences between these datasets. We compare several approaches for merging and jointly analyzing miRNA datasets. We investigate the statistical confidence for known results and highlight potential new findings that resulted from the joint analysis using AQuN. In particular, we detect several miRNAs to be differentially expressed in estrogen receptor (ER) positive versus ER negative samples. In addition, we identify new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for both clinical groups. As a specific example, using the AQuN-derived dataset we detect hsa-miR-193b-5p to have a statistically significant over-expression in the ER positive group, a phenomenon that was not previously reported. Furthermore, as demonstrated by functional assays in breast cancer cell lines, overexpression of hsa-miR-193b-5p in breast cancer cell lines resulted in decreased cell viability in addition to inducing apoptosis. Together, these observations suggest a novel functional role for this miRNA in breast cancer.

<p>by Blake J. M. Williams, Guillaume St-Onge, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne</p>

Mathematical disease modelling has long operated under the assumption that any one infectious disease is caused by one transmissible pathogen spreading among a population. This paradigm has been useful in simplifying the biological reality of epidemics and has allowed the modelling community to focus on the complexity of other factors such as population structure and interventions. However, there is an increasing amount of evidence that the strain diversity of pathogens, and their interplay with the host immune system, can play a large role in shaping the dynamics of epidemics. Here, we introduce a disease model with an underlying genotype network to account for two important mechanisms. One, the disease can mutate along network pathways as it spreads in a host population. Two, the genotype network allows us to define a genetic distance between strains and therefore to model the transcendence of immunity often observed in real world pathogens. We study the emergence of epidemics in this model, through its epidemic phase transitions, and highlight the role of the genotype network in driving cyclicity of diseases, large scale fluctuations, sequential epidemic transitions, as well as localization around specific strains of the associated pathogen. More generally, our model illustrates the richness of behaviours that are possible even in well-mixed host populations once we consider strain diversity and go beyond the “one disease equals one pathogen” paradigm.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PgG2EdCXtMA" width="1" />

<p>by Samuel J. Gershman, Marc Guitart-Masip, James F. Cavanagh</p>

Pavlovian associations drive approach towards reward-predictive cues, and avoidance of punishment-predictive cues. These associations “misbehave” when they conflict with correct instrumental behavior. This raises the question of how Pavlovian and instrumental influences on behavior are arbitrated. We test a computational theory according to which Pavlovian influence will be stronger when inferred controllability of outcomes is low. Using a model-based analysis of a Go/NoGo task with human subjects, we show that theta-band oscillatory power in frontal cortex tracks inferred controllability, and that these inferences predict Pavlovian action biases. Functional MRI data revealed an inferior frontal gyrus correlate of action probability and a ventromedial prefrontal correlate of outcome valence, both of which were modulated by inferred controllability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bp9KwfGg1WI" width="1" />

Increasingly complex in silico modeling approaches offer a way to simultaneously access cancerous processes at different spatio-temporal scales. High-level models, such as those based on partial differential equations, are computationally affordable and allow large tumor sizes and long temporal windows to be studied, but miss the discrete nature of many key underlying cellular processes. Individual-based approaches provide a much more detailed description of tumors, but have difficulties when trying to handle full-sized real cancers. Thus, there exists a trade-off between the integration of macroscopic and microscopic information, now widely available, and the ability to attain clinical tumor sizes. In this paper we put forward a stochastic mesoscopic simulation framework that incorporates key cellular processes during tumor progression while keeping computational costs to a minimum. Our framework captures a physical scale that allows both the incorporation of microscopic information, tracking the spatio-temporal emergence of tumor heterogeneity and the underlying evolutionary dynamics, and the reconstruction of clinically sized tumors from high-resolution medical imaging data, with the additional benefit of low computational cost. We illustrate the functionality of our modeling approach for the case of glioblastoma, a paradigm of tumor heterogeneity that remains extremely challenging in the clinical setting.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IXEvAYsie9A" width="1" />

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a deep convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS by future prospective research.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26045?af=R">Diagnostic utility of Gold Coast criteria in ALS</a></h4>

Objective
The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 88.7‐94.6%) was comparable to Awaji (90.3%, 95%CI 86.69‐93.2% ) and rEEC (88.6, 95%CI 84.8‐91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb‐onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials.

<p>Winfree oscillators are phase oscillator models of neurons, characterized by their phase response curve and pulsatile interaction function. We use the Ott/Antonsen ansatz to study large heterogeneous networks of Winfree oscillators, deriving low-dimensional differential equations which describe the evolution of the expected state of networks of oscillators. We consider the effects of correlations between an oscillator's in-degree and out-degree, and between the in- and out-degrees of an “upstream” and a “downstream” oscillator (degree assortativity). We also consider correlated heterogeneity, where some property of an oscillator is correlated with a structural property such as degree. We finally consider networks with parameter assortativity, coupling oscillators according to their intrinsic frequencies. The results show how different types of network structure influence its overall dynamics.</p>

<p>Besides amyloid fibrils, amyloid pores (APs) represent another mechanism of amyloid induced toxicity. Since hypothesis put forward by Arispe and collegues in 1993 that amyloid-beta makes ion-conducting channels and that Alzheimer's disease may be due to the toxic effect of these channels, many studies have confirmed that APs are formed by prefibrillar oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins and are a common source of cytotoxicity. The mechanism of pore formation is still not well-understood and the structure and imaging of APs in living cells remains an open issue. To get closer to understand AP formation we used predictive methods to assess the propensity of a set of 30 amyloid-forming proteins (AFPs) to form transmembrane channels. A range of amino-acid sequence tools were applied to predict AP domains of AFPs, and provided context on future experiments that are needed in order to contribute toward a deeper understanding of amyloid toxicity. In a set of 30 AFPs we predicted their amyloidogenic propensity, presence of transmembrane (TM) regions, and cholesterol (CBM) and ganglioside binding motifs (GBM), to which the oligomers likely bind. Noteworthy, all pathological AFPs share the presence of TM, CBM, and GBM regions, whereas the functional amyloids seem to show just one of these regions. For comparative purposes, we also analyzed a few examples of amyloid proteins that behave as biologically non-relevant AFPs. Based on the known experimental data on the β-amyloid and α-synuclein pore formation, we suggest that many AFPs have the potential for pore formation. Oligomerization and α-TM helix to β-TM strands transition on lipid rafts seem to be the common key events.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could be beneficial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients independent of any effects on hypertension. However, studies in rodent models directly testing the activity of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevent pathology including neuroinflammation, Aβ levels, and cerebrovascular function, have produced mixed results. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD and has been linked to many of the same functions as those purported to be modulated by ARB treatment. Therefore, evaluating the effects of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevant pathology in mice that express human APOE4 could provide important information on whether to further develop ARBs for AD therapy. In this study, we treated female and male mice that express the human APOE4 gene in the absence (E4FAD−) or presence (E4FAD+) of high Aβ levels with the ARB prodrug candesartan cilexetil for a duration of 4 months. Compared to vehicle, candesartan treatment resulted in greater memory-relevant behavior and higher hippocampal presynaptic protein levels in female, but not male, E4FAD− and E4FAD+ mice. The beneficial effects of candesartan in female E4FAD− and E4FAD+ mice occurred in tandem with lower GFAP and Iba1 levels in the hippocampus, whereas there were no effects on markers of cerebrovascular function and Aβ levels. Collectively, these data imply that the effects of ARBs on AD-relevant pathology may be modulated in part by the interaction between APOE genotype and biological sex. Thus, the further development of ARBs could provide therapeutic options for targeting neuroinflammation in female APOE4 carriers.</p>

<p>Many studies have reported that exercise can influence cognitive performance. But advancing our understanding of the interrelations between psychology and physiology in sports neuroscience requires the study of real-time brain dynamics during exercise in the field. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most powerful brain imaging technologies. However, the limited portability and long preparation time of traditional wet-sensor systems largely limits their use to laboratory settings. Wireless dry-sensor systems are emerging with much greater potential for practical application in sports. Hence, in this paper, we use the BR8 wireless dry-sensor EEG system to measure P300 brain dynamics while cycling at various intensities. The preparation time was mostly less than 2 min as BR8 system’s dry sensors were able to attain the required skin-sensor interface impedance, enabling its operation without any skin preparation or application of conductive gel. Ten participants performed four sessions of a 3 min rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task while resting and while cycling. These four sessions were pre-CE (RSVP only), low-CE (RSVP in 40–50% of max heart rate), vigorous-CE (RSVP in 71–85% of max heart rate) and post-CE (RSVP only). The recorded brain signals demonstrate that the P300 amplitudes, observed at the Pz channel, for the target and non-target responses were significantly different in all four sessions. The results also show decreased reaction times to the visual attention task during vigorous exercise, enriching our understanding of the ways in which exercise can enhance cognitive performance. Even though only a single channel was evaluated in this study, the quality and reliability of the measurement using these dry sensor-based EEG systems is clearly demonstrated by our results. Further, the smooth implementation of the experiment with a dry system and the success of the data analysis demonstrate that wireless dry EEG devices can open avenues for real-time measurement of cognitive functions in athletes outside the laboratory.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a destructive and burdensome neurodegenerative disease, one of the most common characteristics of which are neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are composed of abnormal tau protein. Animal studies have suggested that dl-3-n-butylphthalide (dl-NBP) alleviates cognitive impairment in mouse models of APP/PS1 and SAMP8. However, the underlying mechanisms related to this remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of dl-NBP on learning and memory in P301S transgenic mice, which carry the human tau gene with the P301S mutation. We found that dl-NBP supplementation effectively improved behavioral deficits and rescued synaptic loss in P301S tau transgenic mice, compared with vehicle-treated P301S mice. Furthermore, we also found that it markedly inhibited the hyperphosphorylated tau at the Ser262 site and decreased the activity of MARK4, which was associated with tau at the Ser262 site. Finally, dl-NBP treatment exerted anti-inflammatory effects and reduced inflammatory responses in P301S mice. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that dl-NBP has a promising potential for the therapy of tauopathies, including AD.</p>

<p>brain4care, a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared non-invasive sensor that monitors intracranial pressure waveforms, was used in a 13-year-old girl who presented with untreatable headaches. The patient had a history of craniopharyngioma resection and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement 7 years prior to the use of the device. Secondary obstructive hydrocephalus was also a present factor in the case. The hypothesis was that due to the hydrocephalus, the child presented chronic headaches and needed constant readjustment into the ventriculoperitoneal shunt to regulate the cerebrospinal fluid inside her ventricles in order to control the patient's intracranial pressure (ICP). The device was chosen considering the risks to submit a patient into the regular invasive method to measure ICP. It was identified that the device could also indicate altered intracranial compliance due to the ratio between the P1 and P2 amplitudes (P2/P1 ratio &gt; 1).</p>

<p>In this paper, an artificial intelligence segmented dynamic video image based on the process of intensive cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease monitoring is deeply investigated, and a sparse automatic coding deep neural network with a four layers stack structure is designed to automatically extract the deep features of the segmented dynamic video image shot, and six categories of normal, atrial premature, ventricular premature, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and pacing are achieved through hierarchical training and optimization. Accurate recognition of heartbeats with an average accuracy of 99.5%. It provides technical assistance for the intelligent prediction of high-risk cardiovascular diseases like ventricular fibrillation. An intelligent prediction algorithm for sudden cardiac death based on the echolocation network was proposed. By designing an echolocation network with a multilayer serial structure, an intelligent distinction between sudden cardiac death signal and non-sudden death signal was realized, and the signal was predicted 5 min before sudden death occurred, with an average prediction accuracy of 94.32%. Using the self-learning capability of stack sparse auto-coding network, a large amount of label-free data is designed to train the stack sparse auto-coding deep neural network to automatically extract deep representations of plaque features. A small amount of labeled data then introduced to micro-train the entire network. Through the automatic analysis of the fiber cap thickness in the plaques, the automatic identification of thin fiber cap-like vulnerable plaques was achieved, and the average overlap of vulnerable regions reached 87%. The overall time for the automatic plaque and vulnerable plaque recognition algorithm was 0.54 s. It provides theoretical support for accurate diagnosis and endogenous analysis of high-risk cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Sleep–wake disruptions are among the most prevalent and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Clinical studies have demonstrated that these disturbances can precede the onset of typical motor symptoms by years, indicating that they may play a primary function in the pathogenesis of PD. Animal studies suggest that sleep facilitates the removal of metabolic wastes through the glymphatic system via convective flow from the periarterial space to the perivenous space, upregulates antioxidative defenses, and promotes the maintenance of neuronal protein homeostasis. Therefore, disruptions to the sleep–wake cycle have been associated with inefficient metabolic clearance and increased oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to excessive accumulation of alpha-synuclein and the induction of neuronal loss, both of which have been proposed to be contributing factors to the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that PD-related pathophysiological alterations during the prodromal phase disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Taken together, these findings indicate potential mechanistic interactions between sleep–wake disorders and PD progression as proposed in this review. Further research into the hypothetical mechanisms underlying these interactions would be valuable, as positive findings may provide promising insights into novel therapeutic interventions for PD.</p>

<p>Aging is an irreversible process and the primary risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial impairment is a process that generates oxidative damage and ATP deficit; both factors are important in the memory decline showed during normal aging and AD. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, with a strong influence on both the morphology and physiology of neurons. In AD, tau protein undergoes post-translational modifications, which could play a relevant role in the onset and progression of this disease. Also, these abnormal forms of tau could be present during the physiological aging that could be related to memory impairment present during this stage. We previously showed that tau ablation improves mitochondrial function and cognitive abilities in young wild-type mice. However, the possible contribution of tau during aging that could predispose to the development of AD is unclear. Here, we show that tau deletion prevents cognitive impairment and improves mitochondrial function during normal aging as indicated by a reduction in oxidative damage and increased ATP production. Notably, we observed a decrease in cyclophilin-D (CypD) levels in aged tau−/− mice, resulting in increased calcium buffering and reduced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. The mPTP is a mitochondrial structure, whose opening is dependent on CypD expression, and new evidence suggests that this could play an essential role in the neurodegenerative process showed during AD. In contrast, hippocampal CypD overexpression in aged tau−/− mice impairs mitochondrial function evidenced by an ATP deficit, increased mPTP opening, and memory loss; all effects were observed in the AD pathology. Our results indicate that the absence of tau prevents age-associated cognitive impairment by maintaining mitochondrial function and reducing mPTP opening through a CypD-dependent mechanism. These findings are novel and represent an important advance in the study of how tau contributes to the cognitive and mitochondrial failure present during aging and AD in the brain.</p>

<p>Migraine is a chronic and idiopathic disorder leading to cognitive and affective problems. However, the neural basis of migraine without aura is still unclear. In this study, dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) analyses were performed in 21 patients with migraine without aura and 21 gender- and age-matched healthy controls to identify the voxel-level abnormal functional dynamics. Significantly decreased dALFF in the bilateral anterior insula, bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left middle frontal cortex were found in patients with migraine without aura. The dALFF values in the anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with pain intensity, i.e., visual analog scale. Finally, support vector machine was used to classify patients with migraine without aura from healthy controls and achieved an accuracy of 83.33%, sensitivity of 90.48%, and specificity of 76.19%. Our findings provide the evidence that migraine influences the brain functional activity dynamics and reveal the neural basis for migraine, which could facilitate understanding the neuropathology of migraine and future treatment.</p>

<p>Our prior research demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) exerted a modulatory role in ingroup bias in emotional mimicry. In this study, two experiments were conducted to further explore whether the rTPJ is a neural region for emotional mimicry or for the modulation of emotional mimicry by group membership in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, between-subject design. Both experiments employed non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to temporarily change the cortical excitability over the rTPJ and facial electromyography (fEMG) to measure facial muscle activations as an index of emotional mimicry. After the anodal or sham stimulation, participants in Experiment 1 passively viewed a series of happy clips, while participants in Experiment 2 viewed happy clips performed by ethnic ingroup and outgroup models. fEMG analyses revealed that participants in Experiment 1 showed the same degree of happy mimicry for both tDCS conditions (anodal vs. sham) and participants in Experiment 2 showed an ingroup bias in happy mimicry in the sham condition, which disappeared in the anodal condition. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that rTPJ plays a role in the modulation of emotional mimicry by group membership.</p>

<p>The present study examines the comorbidity between specific learning disorders (SLD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by comparing the neuropsychological profiles of children with and without this comorbidity. Ninety-seven schoolchildren from 8 to 14 years old were tested: a clinical sample of 49 children with ADHD (n = 18), SLD (n = 18) or SLD in comorbidity with ADHD (n = 13), and 48 typically-developing (TD) children matched for age and intelligence. Participants were administered tasks and questionnaires to confirm their initial diagnosis, and a battery of executive function (EF) tasks testing inhibition, shifting, and verbal and visuospatial updating. Using one-way ANOVAs, our results showed that all children in the clinical samples exhibited impairments on EF measures (inhibition and shifting tasks) when compared with TD children. A more specific pattern only emerged for the updating tasks. Only children with SLD had significant impairment in verbal updating, whereas children with ADHD, and those with SLD in comorbidity with ADHD, had the worst performance in visuospatial updating. The clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.611183">Criticality, Connectivity, and Neural Disorder: A Multifaceted Approach to Neural Computation</a></h4>

<p>It has been hypothesized that the brain optimizes its capacity for computation by self-organizing to a critical point. The dynamical state of criticality is achieved by striking a balance such that activity can effectively spread through the network without overwhelming it and is commonly identified in neuronal networks by observing the behavior of cascades of network activity termed “neuronal avalanches.” The dynamic activity that occurs in neuronal networks is closely intertwined with how the elements of the network are connected and how they influence each other's functional activity. In this review, we highlight how studying criticality with a broad perspective that integrates concepts from physics, experimental and theoretical neuroscience, and computer science can provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms that drive networks to criticality and how their disruption may manifest in different disorders. First, integrating graph theory into experimental studies on criticality, as is becoming more common in theoretical and modeling studies, would provide insight into the kinds of network structures that support criticality in networks of biological neurons. Furthermore, plasticity mechanisms play a crucial role in shaping these neural structures, both in terms of homeostatic maintenance and learning. Both network structures and plasticity have been studied fairly extensively in theoretical models, but much work remains to bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental findings. Finally, information theoretical approaches can tie in more concrete evidence of a network's computational capabilities. Approaching neural dynamics with all these facets in mind has the potential to provide a greater understanding of what goes wrong in neural disorders. Criticality analysis therefore holds potential to identify disruptions to healthy dynamics, granted that robust methods and approaches are considered.</p>

<p>Neural circuit formation is an intricate and complex process where multiple neuron types must come together to form synaptic connections at a precise location and time. How this process is orchestrated during development remains poorly understood. Cell adhesion molecules are known to play a pivotal role in assembling neural circuits. They serve as recognition molecules between corresponding synaptic partners. In this study, we identified a new player in assembling neural circuits in the outer retina, the L1-family cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin (Nfasc). Our data reveals Nfasc is expressed in the synaptic layer where photoreceptors make synaptic connections to their respective partners. A closer examination of Nfasc expression shows high levels of expression in rod bipolars but not in cone bipolars. Disruption of Nfasc using a conditional knockout allele results in selective loss of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the rod synaptic layer but not in the cone synaptic layer. Electron microscopic analysis confirms that indeed there are abnormal synaptic structures with less dendrites of rod bipolars innervating rod terminals in loss of Nfasc animals. Consistent with these findings, we also observe a decrease in rod-driven retinal responses with disruption of Nfasc function but not in cone-driven responses. Taken together, our data suggest a new role of Nfasc in rod synapses within the mouse outer retina.</p>

<p>Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, which bear long polysaccharides called heparan sulfate (HS) attached to the core proteins. HSPGs interact with a variety of ligand proteins through the HS chains, and mutations in HSPG-related genes influence many biological processes and cause various diseases. In particular, recent findings from vertebrate and invertebrate studies have raised the importance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HSPGs, glypicans, as central players in the development and functions of synapses. Glypicans are important components of the synapse-organizing protein complexes and serve as ligands for leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs), leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), and G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), regulating synapse formation. Many of these interactions are mediated by the HS chains of glypicans. Neurexins (Nrxs) are also synthesized as HSPGs and bind to some ligands in common with glypicans through HS chains. Therefore, glypicans and Nrxs may act competitively at the synapses. Furthermore, glypicans regulate the postsynaptic expression levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors, controlling the electrophysiological properties and non-canonical BMP signaling of synapses. Dysfunctions of glypicans lead to failures in neuronal network formation, malfunction of synapses, and abnormal behaviors that are characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent human genetics revealed that glypicans and HS are associated with autism spectrum disorder, neuroticism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we introduce the studies showing the roles of glypicans and HS in synapse formation, neural plasticity, and neurological disorders, especially focusing on the mouse and Drosophila as potential models for human diseases.</p>

<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by an aberrant expansion of the CAG tract within the exon 1 of the HD gene, HTT. HD progressively impairs motor and cognitive capabilities, leading to a total loss of autonomy and ultimate death. Currently, no cure or effective treatment is available to halt the disease. Although the HTT gene is ubiquitously expressed, the striatum appears to be the most susceptible district to the HD mutation with Medium-sized Spiny Neurons (MSNs) (D1R and D2R) representing 95% of the striatal neuronal population. Why are striatal MSNs so vulnerable to the HD mutation? Particularly, why do D1R- and D2R-MSNs display different susceptibility to HD? Here, we highlight significant differences between D1R- and D2R-MSNs subpopulations, such as morphology, electrophysiology, transcriptomic, functionality, and localization in the striatum. We discuss possible reasons for their selective degeneration in the context of HD. Our review suggests that a better understanding of cell type-specific gene expression dysregulation within the striatum might reveal new paths to therapeutic intervention or prevention to ameliorate HD patients’ life expectancy.</p>

<p>Dendrites undergo extensive growth and remodeling during their lifetime. Specification of neurites into dendrites is followed by their arborization, maturation, and functional integration into synaptic networks. Each of these distinct developmental processes is spatially and temporally controlled in an exquisite fashion. Protein kinases through their highly specific substrate phosphorylation regulate dendritic growth and plasticity. Perturbation of kinase function results in aberrant dendritic growth and synaptic function. Not surprisingly, kinase dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Herein, we review, (a) key kinase pathways that regulate dendrite structure, function and plasticity, (b) how aberrant kinase signaling contributes to dendritic dysfunction in neurological disorders and (c) emergent technologies that can be applied to dissect the role of protein kinases in dendritic structure and function.</p>

<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex and chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by both degenerative and inflammatory processes leading to axonal damage, demyelination, and neuronal loss. In the last decade, the traditional outside-in standpoint on MS pathogenesis, which identifies a primary autoimmune inflammatory etiology, has been challenged by a complementary inside-out theory. By focusing on the degenerative processes of MS, the axo-myelinic system may reveal new insights into the disease triggering mechanisms. Oxidative stress (OS) has been widely described as one of the means driving tissue injury in neurodegenerative disorders, including MS. Axonal mitochondria constitute the main energy source for electrically active axons and neurons and are largely vulnerable to oxidative injury. Consequently, axonal mitochondrial dysfunction might impair efficient axo-glial communication, which could, in turn, affect axonal integrity and the maintenance of axonal, neuronal, and synaptic signaling. In this review article, we argue that OS-derived mitochondrial impairment may underline the dysfunctional relationship between axons and their supportive glia cells, specifically oligodendrocytes and that this mechanism is implicated in the development of a primary cytodegeneration and a secondary pro-inflammatory response (inside-out), which in turn, together with a variably primed host’s immune system, may lead to the onset of MS and its different subtypes.</p>

<p>Ginkgolide B (GB), a terpene lactone and active ingredient of Ginkgo biloba, shows protective effects in neuronal cells subjected to hypoxia. We investigated whether GB might protect neurons from hypoxic injury through regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Primary hippocampal neurons subjected to chemical hypoxia (0.7 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>) in vitro exhibited an increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (measured from the fluorescence of fluo-4), but this effect was significantly diminished by pre-treatment with 0.4 mM GB. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain slices of rats exposed to hypoxia in vivo revealed increases in spontaneous discharge frequency, action potential frequency and calcium current magnitude, and all these effects of hypoxia were suppressed by pre-treatment with 12 mg/kg GB. Western blot analysis demonstrated that hypoxia was associated with enhanced mRNA and protein expressions of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (a voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel), STIM1 (a regulator of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry) and RyR2 (isoforms of Ryanodine Receptor which mediates sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release), and these actions of hypoxia were suppressed by GB. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that GB might protect neurons from hypoxia, in part, by regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p>

Background<p>Aging and pre-existing cognitive impairment are considered to be independent risk factors for sepsis-associated encephalopathy. This study aimed to investigate the manner in which aging and pre-existing cognitive dysfunction modified neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and basal synaptic transmission during the acute phase of sepsis using Senescence-Accelerated Mice Prone 8 (SAMP8) and Senescence-Accelerated Resistant Mice 1 (SAMR1).</p>Methods<p>We used 6-month-old SAMP8 and SAMR1. Sepsis was induced using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The animal’s hippocampi and blood were collected for subsequent investigations 24 h after surgery.</p>Results<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the Shaffer-collateral (SC)-CA1 pathway of the hippocampus in SAMP8 without surgery compared to the age-matched SAMR1, which was reflective of cognitive dysfunction in SAMP8. CLP impaired the SC-CA1 LTP in SAMR1 compared to the sham-operated controls, but not in SAMP8. Moreover, CLP decreased the input-output curve and increased the paired-pulse ratio in SAMP8, suggesting the reduced probability of basal synaptic transmission due to sepsis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CLP elevated IL-1β levels, especially in the hippocampi of SAMP8 with microglial activation. In vivo peripheral IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) administration in the septic SAMP8 revealed that the neuroinflammation was not correlated with the peripheral elevation of IL-1β. Ex vivo IL-1ra administration to the hippocampus ameliorated LTP impairment in SAMR1 and the reduction in basal transmission in SAMP8 after sepsis.</p>Conclusions<p>The mechanism of the modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity by the acute stage of sepsis differed between SAMR1 and SAMP8. These changes were related to centrally derived IL-1 receptor-mediated signaling and were accompanied by microglial activation, especially in SAMP8.</p>

<p>Background: Dementia, as a global public health problem, is becoming increasingly serious. As a precursor of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of dementia. Recent studies have found a correlation between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and cognitive function in men. The relationship between GGT levels and cognitive function in women remains unclear because GGT activity and expression differ between the sexes.</p><p>Method: We recruited a total of 2,943 Chinese women from Jidong and Taian in 2019. We grouped the participants according to GGT levels, diagnosed MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale, and modeled the study outcomes using logistic regression to explore the relationship between GGT level and MCI. We also analyzed the interaction of obesity, sleep duration, and hyperuricemia with GGT in the development of MCI.</p><p>Results: The prevalence of MCI increased with increasing GGT level, from the lowest quartile to the highest quartile of GGT: 8.4% (66/786), 14.2% (119/840), 17.6% (108/613), and 21.4% (151/704), respectively. At the same time, as GGT levels increased, so did the risk of MCI. In the fully adjusted model, compared with those for participants in the lowest GGT quartiles, the odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MCI for participants in the second, third, and fourth GGT quartiles were 1.49 (1.04–2.12), 1.53(1.06–2.21), and 1.88 (1.33–2.65), respectively. The risk of developing MCI was further increased in people with high GGT levels who were obese (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.39–2.76, P &lt; 0.001), slept less (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.35–2.71, P &lt; 0.001), had high levels of uric acid (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03–2.32, P &lt; 0.001), or after menopause (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 2.07–4.12, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion: We found that MCI is more common in women with elevated GGT levels, so GGT could be a potential diagnostic marker for MCI. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that women with high GGT levels had an increased risk of MCI when they were obese, sleep deprived, had high serum uric acid (SUA) levels or underwent menopause.</p>

<p>Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the major mental health outcomes on dementia patient carers when using psychoeducational programs and psychotherapeutic interventions.</p><p>Methods: A meta-analysis was performed with randomized controlled trials of carers' tele-health interventions from the literature inception to December 31, 2019, using PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for articles.</p><p>Results: The meta-analysis identified 1,043 results, of which 11 were randomized control trials. Among all 11 randomized control trials, only one study addressed face-to-face contact with online modules of interventions, four studies addressed telephone-based interventions, two studies reported on combined face-to-face contact and phone call interventions, two studies focused on web-based interventions, one study used video and telephone interventions, and one study conducted a computer-telephone integration system of intervention. The updated evidence suggested that there was more efficacy via tele-health interventions in lowering depression for carers of people with dementia. We outlined the delivery formation of intervention to evaluate the effectiveness and processes of major mental health improvements, including depression, burden, anxiety, and quality of life.</p><p>Conclusions: In this study, tele-health intervention was shown to significantly lower depression and also lower the risk of mental health impairment. Although there was a significant decrease of depression, there were no significant differences in burden, anxiety, and quality of life. Future researchers are encouraged to carry out larger-scale studies; also, further analysis using a standardized assessment tool is suggested for future multi-component tele-health interventions.</p>

<p>Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded as part of the pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. The insular subregional networks are thought to have diverse intrinsic connectivity patterns that are involved in cognitive and emotional processing. We set out to investigate convergent and divergent altered connectivity patterns of the insular subregions across the spectrum of pre-clinical AD and evaluated how well these patterns can differentiate the pre-clinical AD spectrum.</p><p>Method: Functional connectivity (FC) analyses in insular subnetworks were carried out among 38 patients with SCD, 56 patients with aMCI, and 55 normal controls (CNs). Logistic regression analyses were used to construct models for aMCI and CN, as well as SCD and CN classification. Finally, we conducted correlation analyses to measure the relationship between FCs of altered insular subnetworks and cognition.</p><p>Results: Patients with SCD presented with reduced FC in the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and increased FC in the medial frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. On the other hand, patients with aMCI largely presented with decreased FC in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, the cerebellum posterior lobe, and the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as increased FC in the medial and inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle and superior temporal gyrus. Logistic regression analyses indicated that a model composed of FCs among altered insular subnetworks in patients with SCD was able to appropriately classify 83.9% of patients with SCD and CN, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.876, 81.6% sensitivity, and 81.8% specificity. A model consisting of altered insular subnetwork FCs in patients with aMCI was able to appropriately classify 86.5% of the patients with aMCI and CNs, with an AUC of 0.887, 80.4% sensitivity, and 83.6% specificity. Furthermore, some of the FCs among altered insular subnetworks were significantly correlated with episodic memory and executive function.</p><p>Conclusions: Patients with SCD and aMCI are likely to share similar convergent and divergent altered intrinsic FC patterns of insular subnetworks as the pre-clinical AD spectrum, and presented with abnormalities among subnetworks. Based on these abnormalities, individuals can be correctly differentiated in the pre-clinical AD spectrum. These results suggest that alterations in insular subnetworks can be utilized as a potential biomarker to aid in conducting a clinical diagnosis of the spectrum of pre-clinical AD.</p>

Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. All the patients had complete follow‐up to death or recovery. Severe COVID‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID‐19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID‐19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID‐19. Recent use (&lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the COVID‐19 pandemic persists. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>by Kentaro Katahira, Asako Toyama</p>

Computational modeling has been applied for data analysis in psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. One of its important uses is to infer the latent variables underlying behavior by which researchers can evaluate corresponding neural, physiological, or behavioral measures. This feature is especially crucial for computational psychiatry, in which altered computational processes underlying mental disorders are of interest. For instance, several studies employing model-based fMRI—a method for identifying brain regions correlated with latent variables—have shown that patients with mental disorders (e.g., depression) exhibit diminished neural responses to reward prediction errors (RPEs), which are the differences between experienced and predicted rewards. Such model-based analysis has the drawback that the parameter estimates and inference of latent variables are not necessarily correct—rather, they usually contain some errors. A previous study theoretically and empirically showed that the error in model-fitting does not necessarily cause a serious error in model-based fMRI. However, the study did not deal with certain situations relevant to psychiatry, such as group comparisons between patients and healthy controls. We developed a theoretical framework to explore such situations. We demonstrate that the parameter-misspecification can critically affect the results of group comparison. We demonstrate that even if the RPE response in patients is completely intact, a spurious difference to healthy controls is observable. Such a situation occurs when the ground-truth learning rate differs between groups but a common learning rate is used, as per previous studies. Furthermore, even if the parameters are appropriately fitted to individual participants, spurious group differences in RPE responses are observable when the model lacks a component that differs between groups. These results highlight the importance of appropriate model-fitting and the need for caution when interpreting the results of model-based fMRI.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4SPMevSdaIQ" width="1" />

Metagenomics has redefined many areas of microbiology. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are often fragmented, primarily when sequencing was performed with short reads. Recent long-read sequencing technologies promise to improve genome reconstruction. However, the integration of two different sequencing modalities makes downstream analyses complex. We, therefore, developed MUFFIN, a complete metagenomic workflow that uses short and long reads to produce high-quality bins and their annotations. The workflow is written by using Nextflow, a workflow orchestration software, to achieve high reproducibility and fast and straightforward use. This workflow also produces the taxonomic classification and KEGG pathways of the bins and can be further used for quantification and annotation by providing RNA-Seq data (optionally). We tested the workflow using twenty biogas reactor samples and assessed the capacity of MUFFIN to process and output relevant files needed to analyze the microbial community and their function. MUFFIN produces functional pathway predictions and, if provided <i>de novo</i> metatranscript annotations across the metagenomic sample and for each bin.

<p>by Yoshiki Ito, Taro Toyoizumi</p>

Traveling waves are commonly observed across the brain. While previous studies have suggested the role of traveling waves in learning, the mechanism remains unclear. We adopted a computational approach to investigate the effect of traveling waves on synaptic plasticity. Our results indicate that traveling waves facilitate the learning of poly-synaptic network paths when combined with a reward-dependent local synaptic plasticity rule. We also demonstrate that traveling waves expedite finding the shortest paths and learning nonlinear input/output mapping, such as exclusive or (XOR) function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DkO94sh4HrQ" width="1" />

Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 LBD patients, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p=0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders.

In this study we show that the invertebrate cephalic glia (CEPglia) are important regulators of complex behaviors. Caenorhabditis elegans CEPglia are similar to astrocytes and assist in temporally regulating bidirectional communication with neurons and non‐neuronal cells. Thus, CEPglia mediated signaling facilitates the fluent transition between independent behaviors in a complex motor program.

Abstract
Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission; yet, it remains unclear how glia influence complex behaviors. Here, we explore the effects of Caenorhabditis elegans astrocyte‐like cephalic glia (CEPglia) and the glia‐specific bHLH transcription factor HLH‐17 on mating behavior and the defecation motor program (DMP). In C. elegans, male mating has been explicitly described through the male tail circuit and is characterized by coordination of multiple independent behaviors to ensure that copulation is achieved. Furthermore, the sex‐specific male mating circuitry shares similar components with the DMP, which is complex and rhythmic, and requires a fixed sequence of behaviors to be activated periodically. We found that loss of CEPglia reduced persistence in executing mating behaviors and hindered copulation, while males that lacked HLH‐17 demonstrated repetitive prodding behavior that increased the time spent in mating but did not hinder copulation. During the DMP, we found that posterior body wall contractions (pBocs) and enteric muscle contractions (EMCs) were differentially affected by loss of HLH‐17 or CEPglia in males and hermaphrodites. pBocs and EMCs required HLH‐17 activity in both sexes, whereas loss of CEPglia alone did not affect DMP in males. Our data suggest that CEPglia mediate complex behaviors by signaling to the GABAergic DVB neuron, and that HLH‐17 activity influences those discrete steps within those behaviors. Collectively, these data provide evidence of glia as a link in cooperative regulation of complex and rhythmic behavior that, in C. elegans links circuitry in the head and the tail.

<p>The existing computational models used to estimate motion sickness are incapable of describing the fact that the predictability of motion patterns affects motion sickness. Therefore, the present study proposes a computational model to describe the effect of the predictability of dynamics or the pattern of motion stimuli on motion sickness. In the proposed model, a submodel – in which a recursive Gaussian process regression is used to represent human features of online learning and future prediction of motion dynamics – is combined with a conventional model of motion sickness based on an observer theory. A simulation experiment was conducted in which the proposed model predicted motion sickness caused by a 900 s horizontal movement. The movement was composed of a 9 m repetitive back-and-forth movement pattern with a pause. Regarding the motion condition, the direction and timing of the motion were varied as follows: (a) Predictable motion (M_P): the direction of the motion and duration of the pause were set to 8 s; (b) Motion with unpredicted direction (M_dU): the pause duration was fixed as in (M_P), but the motion direction was randomly determined; (c) Motion with unpredicted timing (M_tU): the motion direction was fixed as in (M_P), but the pause duration was randomly selected from 4 to 12 s. The results obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that the predicted motion sickness incidence for (M_P) was smaller than those for (M_dU) and (M_tU) and no considerable difference was found between M_dU and M_tU. This tendency agrees with the sickness patterns observed in a previous experimental study in which the human participants were subject to motion conditions similar to those used in our simulations. Moreover, no significant differences were found in the predicted motion sickness incidences at different conditions when the conventional model was used.</p>

<p>Slow oscillations are a pattern of synchronized network activity generated by the cerebral cortex. They consist of Up and Down states, which are periods of activity interspersed with periods of silence, respectively. However, even when this is a unique dynamic regime of transitions between Up and Down states, this pattern is not constant: there is a range of oscillatory frequencies (0.1–4 Hz), and the duration of Up vs. Down states during the cycles is variable. This opens many questions. Is there a constant relationship between the duration of Up and Down states? How much do they vary across conditions and oscillatory frequencies? Are there different sub regimes within the slow oscillations? To answer these questions, we aimed to explore a concrete aspect of slow oscillations, Up and Down state durations, across three conditions: deep anesthesia, light anesthesia, and slow-wave sleep (SWS), in the same chronically implanted rats. We found that light anesthesia and SWS have rather similar properties, occupying a small area of the Up and Down state duration space. Deeper levels of anesthesia occupy a larger region of this space, revealing that a large variety of Up and Down state durations can emerge within the slow oscillatory regime. In a network model, we investigated the network parameters that can explain the different points within our bifurcation diagram in which slow oscillations are expressed.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.560008">Glycinergic Transmission in the Presence and Absence of Functional GlyT2: Lessons From the Auditory Brainstem</a></h4>

<p>Synaptic transmission is controlled by re-uptake systems that reduce transmitter concentrations in the synaptic cleft and recycle the transmitter into presynaptic terminals. The re-uptake systems are thought to ensure cytosolic concentrations in the terminals that are sufficient for reloading empty synaptic vesicles (SVs). Genetic deletion of glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) results in severely disrupted inhibitory neurotransmission and ultimately to death. Here we investigated the role of GlyT2 at inhibitory glycinergic synapses in the mammalian auditory brainstem. These synapses are tuned for resilience, reliability, and precision, even during sustained high-frequency stimulation when endocytosis and refilling of SVs probably contribute substantially to efficient replenishment of the readily releasable pool (RRP). Such robust synapses are formed between MNTB and LSO neurons (medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, lateral superior olive). By means of patch-clamp recordings, we assessed the synaptic performance in controls, in GlyT2 knockout mice (KOs), and upon acute pharmacological GlyT2 blockade. Via computational modeling, we calculated the reoccupation rate of empty release sites and RRP replenishment kinetics during 60-s challenge and 60-s recovery periods. Control MNTB-LSO inputs maintained high fidelity neurotransmission at 50 Hz for 60 s and recovered very efficiently from synaptic depression. During 'marathon-experiments' (30,600 stimuli in 20 min), RRP replenishment accumulated to 1,260-fold. In contrast, KO inputs featured severe impairments. For example, the input number was reduced to ~1 (vs. ~4 in controls), implying massive functional degeneration of the MNTB-LSO microcircuit and a role of GlyT2 during synapse maturation. Surprisingly, neurotransmission did not collapse completely in KOs as inputs still replenished their small RRP 80-fold upon 50 Hz | 60 s challenge. However, they totally failed to do so for extended periods. Upon acute pharmacological GlyT2 inactivation, synaptic performance remained robust, in stark contrast to KOs. RRP replenishment was 865-fold in marathon-experiments, only ~1/3 lower than in controls. Collectively, our empirical and modeling results demonstrate that GlyT2 re-uptake activity is not the dominant factor in the SV recycling pathway that imparts indefatigability to MNTB-LSO synapses. We postulate that additional glycine sources, possibly the antiporter Asc-1, contribute to RRP replenishment at these high-fidelity brainstem synapses.</p>

<p>P2X7 receptors are members of the ATP-gated cationic channel family with a preferential localization at the microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain. However, these receptors are also present at neuroglia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) although at a considerably lower density. They mediate necrosis/apoptosis by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the excitotoxic (glio)transmitters glutamate and ATP. Besides mediating cell damage i.e., superimposed upon chronic neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they may also participate in neuroglial signaling to neurons under conditions of high ATP concentrations during any other form of neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. It is a pertinent open question whether P2X7Rs are localized on neurons, or whether only neuroglia/microglia possess this receptor-type causing indirect effects by releasing the above-mentioned signaling molecules. We suggest as based on molecular biology and functional evidence that neurons are devoid of P2X7Rs although the existence of neuronal P2X7Rs cannot be excluded with absolute certainty.</p>

<p>The classic concept of the absence of lymphatic vessels in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting the immune privilege of the brain in spite of its high metabolic rate, was predominant until recent times. On the other hand, this idea left questioned how cerebral interstitial fluid is cleared of waste products. It was generally thought that clearance depends on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Not long ago, an anatomically and functionally discrete paravascular space was revised to provide a pathway for the clearance of molecules drained within the interstitial space. According to this model, CSF enters the brain parenchyma along arterial paravascular spaces. Once mixed with interstitial fluid and solutes in a process mediated by aquaporin-4, CSF exits through the extracellular space along venous paravascular spaces, thus being removed from the brain. This process includes the participation of perivascular glial cells due to a sieving effect of their end-feet. Such draining space resembles the peripheral lymphatic system, therefore, the term “glymphatic” (glial-lymphatic) pathway has been coined. Specific studies focused on the potential role of the glymphatic pathway in healthy and pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. This mainly concerns Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as hemorrhagic and ischemic neurovascular disorders; other acute degenerative processes, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus or traumatic brain injury are involved as well. Novel morphological and functional investigations also suggested alternative models to drain molecules through perivascular pathways, which enriched our insight of homeostatic processes within neural microenvironment. Under the light of these considerations, the present article aims to discuss recent findings and concepts on nervous lymphatic drainage and blood–brain barrier (BBB) in an attempt to understand how peripheral pathological conditions may be detrimental to the CNS, paving the way to neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Background: Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound (LITUS) may have a therapeutic effect on Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients to some extent.

Single-shot spin echo echo-planar imaging and fast low-angle shot T2WI sequences at 3.0 T were used. The FA and T2<sup>∗</sup> values on the right side of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in the rats.</p><p>Results: One week after PD-like signs were induced in the rats, the FA value in the LITUS group was significantly larger compared with the PD group (0.214 ± 0.027 vs. 0.340 ± 0.032, t = 2.864, P = 0.011). At the 5th and 6th weeks, the FA values in the LITUS group were significantly smaller compared with the PD group (5th week: 0.290 ± 0.037 vs. 0.405 ± 0.027, t = 2.385, P = 0.030; 6th week: 0.299 ± 0.021 vs. 0.525 ± 0.028, t = 6.620, P &lt; 0.0001). In the 5th and 6th weeks, the T2<sup>∗</sup> values in the injected right SN of the LITUS group were significantly higher compared with the PD group (5th week, 12.169 ± 0.826 in the LITUS group vs. 7.550 ± 0.824 in the PD group; 6th week, 11.749 ± 0.615 in the LITUS group vs. 7.550 ± 0.849 in the PD group).</p><p>Conclusion: LITUS had neuroprotective effects and can reduce the damage of 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in hemi-PD rats.

<p>Inflammatory response contributes to brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Our previous literature has shown isoquercetin plays an important role in protecting against cerebral I/R injury. The present study was conducted to further investigate the effect of isoquercetin on inflammation-induced neuronal injury in I/R rats with the involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) neuron model were used. MCAO/R induced neurological deficits, cell apoptosis, and release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in ischemic brain in rats. Simultaneously, the expression of TLR4 and C5aR1 was significantly up-regulated in both MCAO/R rats and OGD/R neurons, accompanied with the inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling and activation of I-κB/NF-κB signaling in the cortex of MCAO/R rats. Over-expression of C5aR1 in neurons induced decrease of cell viability, exerting similar effects with OGD/R injury. Isoquercetin acted as a neuroprotective agent against I/R brain injury to suppress inflammatory response and improve cell recovery by inhibiting TLR4 and C5aR1 expression, promoting cAMP/PKA activation, and inhibiting I-κB/NF-κB activation and Caspase 3 expression. TLR4 and C5aR1 contributed to inflammation and apoptosis via activating cAMP/PKA/I-κB/NF-κB signaling during cerebral I/R, suggesting that this signaling pathway may be a potent therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. Isoquercetin was identified as a neuroprotective agent, which maybe a promising therapeutic agent used for the treatment of ischemic stroke and related diseases.</p>

Background<p>Disturbance of networks was recently proposed to be associated with the occurrence of depression in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the neurobiological mechanism of depression underlying PD remains unclear.</p>Objective<p>This study was conducted to investigate whether intra-network and inter-network brain connectivity is differently changed in PD patients with and without depression (PDD and PDND patients, respectively).</p>Methods<p>Forty-one PDD patients, 64 PDND patients, and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), precuneus network (PCUN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) were extracted using independent component analysis (ICA), and then the functional connectivity (FC) values within and between these networks were measured.</p>Results<p>PDD patients exhibited abnormal FC values within the DMN, ECN, SN, PCUN, and SMN. In addition, PDD patients demonstrated decreased connectivity between anterior SN (aSN) and bilateral ECN, between posterior SN (pSN) and dorsal DMN (dDMN), and between PCUN and dDMN/SMN/bilateral ECN. Connectivity within the left hippocampus of dDMN and the right medial superior frontal gyrus of aSN was a significant predictor of depression level in PD patients.</p>Conclusions<p>Aberrant intra- and inter-network FC is involved in several important hubs in the large-scale networks, which can be a biomarker for distinguishing PDD from PDND.</p>

<p>The loss or absence of vision is probably one of the most incapacitating events that can befall a human being. The importance of vision for humans is also reflected in brain anatomy as approximately one third of the human brain is devoted to vision. It is therefore unsurprising that throughout history many attempts have been undertaken to develop devices aiming at substituting for a missing visual capacity. In this review, we present two concepts that have been prevalent over the last two decades. The first concept is sensory substitution, which refers to the use of another sensory modality to perform a task that is normally primarily sub-served by the lost sense. The second concept is cross-modal plasticity, which occurs when loss of input in one sensory modality leads to reorganization in brain representation of other sensory modalities. Both phenomena are training-dependent. We also briefly describe the history of blindness from ancient times to modernity, and then proceed to address the means that have been used to help blind individuals, with an emphasis on modern technologies, invasive (various type of surgical implants) and non-invasive devices. With the advent of brain imaging, it has become possible to peer into the neural substrates of sensory substitution and highlight the magnitude of the plastic processes that lead to a rewired brain. Finally, we will address the important question of the value and practicality of the available technologies and future directions.</p>

<p>The concept of empathy describes our capacity to understand the emotions and intentions of others and to relate to our conspecifics. Numerous studies investigated empathy as a state as well as a stable personality trait. For example, recent studies in neuroscience suggest, among other brain areas such as the insula or the ACC, a role of the somatosensory cortices for empathy (e.g., when observing someone else being touched). Since the classic understanding of the primary somatosensory cortex is to represent touch on the body surface, we here aimed to test whether tactile performance is linked to the personality trait empathy. To test this, we examined the tactile acuity of 95 healthy participants (mean age 31 years) by using a two-point discrimination threshold task at the index fingers. Trait empathy was assessed by employing the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), which measures self-reported empathy with four scales (empathic concern, perspective taking, fantasy, and personal distress). Results of regression analyses suggested the subscale empathic concern to be positively associated with performance in the tactile acuity task. We discuss this finding in the light of recent studies on empathy and consider possible implications of tactile training to enhance empathy.</p>

<p>Olfactory bulb and higher processing areas are synaptically interconnected, providing rapid regulation of olfactory bulb circuit dynamics and sensory processing. Short-term plasticity changes at any of these synapses could modulate sensory processing and potentially short-term sensory memory. A key olfactory bulb circuit for mediating cortical feedback modulation is granule cells, which are targeted by multiple cortical regions including both glutamatergic excitatory inputs and GABAergic inhibitory inputs. There is robust endocannabinoid modulation of excitatory inputs to granule cells and here we explored whether there was also endocannabinoid modulation of the inhibitory cortical inputs to granule cells. We expressed light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and their projections to granule cells in olfactory bulb. Selective optical activation of ChR2 positive axons/terminals generated strong, frequency-dependent short-term depression of GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated-IPSC in granule cells. As cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is heavily expressed in olfactory bulb granule cell layer (GCL) and there is endogenous endocannabinoid release in GCL, we investigated whether activation of CB1 receptor modulated the HDB IPSC and short-term depression at the HDB→granule cell synapse. Activation of the CB1 receptor by the exogenous agonist Win 55,212-2 significantly decreased the peak amplitude of individual IPSC and decreased short-term depression, while blockade of the CB1 receptor by AM 251 slightly increased individual IPSCs and increased short-term depression. Thus, we conclude that there is tonic endocannabinoid activation of the GABAergic projections of the HDB to granule cells, similar to the modulation observed with glutamatergic projections to granule cells. Modulation of inhibitory synaptic currents and frequency-dependent short-term depression could regulate the precise balance of cortical feedback excitation and inhibition of granule cells leading to changes in granule cell mediated inhibition of olfactory bulb output to higher processing areas.</p>

<p>Stroke, the most prevalent cerebrovascular disease, causes serious loss of neurological function and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacological and surgical therapy, treatment for functional rehabilitation following stroke is limited with a consequent serious impact on quality of life. Over the past decades, mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)-based therapy has emerged as a novel strategy for various diseases including stroke due to their unique properties that include easy isolation, multipotent differentiation potential and strong paracrine capacity. Although MSCs have shown promising results in the treatment of stroke, there remain many challenges to overcome prior to their therapeutic application. In this review, we focus on the following issues: the scientific data from preclinical studies and clinical trials of MSCs in the treatment of stroke; the potential mechanisms underlying MSC-based therapy for stroke; the challenges related to the timing and delivery of MSCs and MSC senescence.</p>

<p>Background: Modular organization reflects the activity patterns of our brain. Different disease states may lead to different activity patterns and clinical features.

Thus, explored the modular organization of EOD and LOD might help us understand their pathogenesis.</p><p>Method: The study included 82 patients with late life depression (EOD 40, LOD 42) and 90 healthy controls. We evaluated the memory, executive function and processing speed and performed resting-stage functional MRI for all participants.

Rh.10d.ROI (polar frontal cortex) and Rh.IPS1.ROI (dorsal stream visual cortex) were shown to be the potential specific nodes in the modular assignment according to the Phi coefficient (P = 0.0002, P<sub>fdr</sub> = 0.0744 &amp; P = 0.0004, P<sub>fdr</sub> = 0.0744).</p><p>Conclusion: This study reveal that the functional modularity and partition were different between EOD and LOD in Granger function network.

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related and second most common neurodegenerative disorder. In recent years, increasing evidence revealed that peripheral immune cells might be able to infiltrate into brain tissues, which could arouse neuroinflammation and aggravate neurodegeneration. This study aimed to illuminate the landscape of peripheral immune cells and signature genes associated with immune infiltration in PD. Several transcriptomic datasets of substantia nigra (SN) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were separately collected as training cohort, testing cohort, and external validation cohort. The immunoscore of each sample calculated by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to reflect the peripheral immune cell infiltration and to identify the differential immune cell types between PD and healthy participants. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the immunoscore achieved an overall accuracy of the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.883 in the testing cohort, respectively. The immunoscore displayed good performance in the external validation cohort with an AUC of 0.745. The correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the correlation between immune cells and PD, and mast cell was identified most associated with the occurrence of PD. Additionally, increased mast cells were also observed in our in vivo PD model. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to selected module genes related to a mast cell. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and random-forest analysis were used to analyze module genes, and two hub genes RBM3 and AGTR1 were identified as associated with mast cells in the training cohort. The expression levels of RBM3 and AGTR1 in these cohorts and PD models revealed that these hub genes were significantly downregulated in PD. Moreover, the expression trend of the aforementioned two genes differed in mast cells and dopaminergic (DA) neurons. In conclusion, this study not only exhibited a landscape of immune infiltrating patterns in PD but also identified mast cells and two hub genes associated with the occurrence of PD, which provided potential therapeutic targets for PD patients (PDs).</p>

Abstract
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus, which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (∼2.5 months old ) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: (1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; (2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and (3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: (1) PDYN expression in granule cells; (2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; (3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and (4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.

The Mediator multiprotein complex functions as a regulator of RNA polymerase II–catalyzed gene transcription. In this study, exome sequencing detected biallelic putative disease‐causing variants in MED27, encoding Mediator complex subunit 27, in 16 patients from 11 families with a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome. Patient phenotypes are highly homogeneous, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, axial hypotonia with distal spasticity, dystonic movements, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seizures and cataracts were noted in severely affected individuals. Identification of multiple patients with biallelic MED27 variants supports the critical role of MED27 in normal human neural development, particularly for the cerebellum. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
Memorizing the locations of environmental cues is crucial for survival and depends on the hippocampus. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely moving mice during an object location task. The power of beta‐band (23–30 Hz) oscillations increased immediately before approaching objects in a memory‐encoding phase. The exploration‐induced beta oscillations gradually decreased during the memory‐encoding session. Mice that exhibited stronger beta oscillation power exhibited better performance in the subsequent memory‐retrieval test. These results suggest that beta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in the memory encoding of object‐location associations.

<p>by Bailong Zhang, Xuemei Chen</p>

In plants, conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) tend to be encoded by gene families with multiple members. Two recent studies interrogated the functions of the 5-member MIR172 family in Arabidopsis and revealed complexities and intricacies of gene regulatory networks underlying floral transition.

Astrocytes are essential cells of the CNS with several functions relating to neuronal and overall homeostasis. As a result, astrocytic dysfunction can cause widespread detrimental effects. There still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is only beginning to be explored. Accordingly, we will detail the role of astrocytes in over 40+ rare neurological conditions through the lens of function and morphology and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.







Abstract
Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood–brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.

Abstract
Evidence from everyday life suggests that differences in social behaviors between males and females exist, both in animal and in humans. These differences can be related to socio‐cultural determinants, but also to specialized portions of the brain (the social brain), from the neurotransmitter to the neural network level. The high vulnerability of this system is expressed by the wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with social dysfunctions, particularly social withdrawal. The principal psychiatric disorders with prominent social withdrawal are described, including hikikomori‐like syndromes, and anxiety, depressive, autistic, schizophrenic, and personality disorders. It is hypothesized that social withdrawal can be partially independent from other symptoms and likely reflect alterations in the social brain itself, leading to a similar, transdiagnostic social dysfunction, reflecting defects in the social brain across a variety of psychopathological conditions. An overview is provided of gender effects in the biological determinants of social behavior, including: the anatomical structures of the social brain; the dimorphic brain structures, and the modulation of their development by sex steroids; gender differences in “social” neurotransmitters (vasopressin and oxytocin), and in their response to social stress. A better comprehension of gender differences in the phenotypes of social disorders and in the neural bases of social behaviors may provide new insights for timely, focused, innovative, and gender‐specific treatments.

Abstract
Visuoperceptive deficits are frequently reported in severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) and are considered as pervasive and persistent in time. While this topic of investigation has previously driven researchers' interest, far fewer studies have focused on visuoperception in SAUD since the ‘90s, leaving open central questions regarding the origin and implications of these deficits. To renew research in the field and provide a solid background to work upon, this paper reviews the neural correlates of visuoperception in SAUD, based on data from neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Results reveal structural and functional changes within the visual system but also in the connections between occipital and frontal areas. We highlight the lack of integration of these findings in the dominant models of vision which stress the dynamic nature of the visual system and consider the presence of both bottom‐up and top‐down cerebral mechanisms. Visuoperceptive changes are also discussed in the framework of long‐lasting debates regarding the influence of demographic and alcohol‐related factors, together stressing the presence of inter‐individual differences. Capitalizing on this review, we provide guidelines to inform future research, and ultimately improve clinical care.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26043?af=R">ApoE4 reduction with ASOs decreases neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model</a></h4>

Objective
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we utilized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 months and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.


Interpretation
We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be further explored as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease.

A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.






Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation (LT‐ICMS). We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA) and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b and 1‐2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV) and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25122?af=R">Convergence of peptidergic and non‐peptidergic protein markers in the human dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn</a></h4>

Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) and the purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2X3R) label relatively distinct populations of nociceptors in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These two unique populations, known as the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic nociceptors, innervate different lamina of the rodent spinal dorsal horn. However, contrary to previous reports in rodent, we find that CGRP and P2X3R are highly co‐expressed in the human DRG and terminate in the same laminae (laminae 1‐2) of the spinal dorsal horn. Additionally, we find that other markers such as TrpV1 and Nav1.7 are more widely expressed in human and innervate laminae 1‐2 of the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that sensory neurons and their central projections are different between mice and humans.







Abstract
Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non‐peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co‐expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1 and Nav1.7 protein stained the entirety of lamina 1‐2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26040?af=R">Adults with cerebral palsy require ongoing neurologic care: A systematic review</a></h4>

Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, like stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest: 1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral; and 2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25019?af=R">Differential development of myelin in zebra finch song nuclei</a></h4>

The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.







Abstract
Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.

Schwann cells (SCs) were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.







Abstract
Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.

Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.







Abstract
Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of nonneuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.

A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a well encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.







Abstract
The natural endocast Museo di Geologia e Paleontologia of the Università degli Studi di Torino (MGPT)‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between ca. 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe, and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of MGPT‐PU 13873 is ~1.81; therefore, this specimen shows an EQ in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.

Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate Leucoraja erinacea. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention.

Abstract
Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate Leucoraja erinacea. We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor: ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal's anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.

VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.
VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.
Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.









Abstract
The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.

Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a similar general neuroanatomical organization and revealed equivalent innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e., the podia and the spines).







Abstract
The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of representatives of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus, the asteroid Patiria miniata, and the holothuroid Parastichopus parvimensis. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species, including at the level of the appendages. Our results support the previously proposed hypotheses for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis for more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.

Ivanova et al., use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow.







Abstract
Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, and Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.

Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease (LD)—a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the LD mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.







Abstract
Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the EPM2A or the NHLRC1 gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and Cortical layer V of the Epm2a or Nhlrc1 knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in Postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1–2 months) as well as the older (7–8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.

Patients with COVID‐19 can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, CXCL8, and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active TGF‐β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a para‐infectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26042?af=R">Endosome dysregulation in Down syndrome: a potential contributor to Alzheimer's disease pathology</a></h4>

Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, the degradation and the retrograde pathway. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever’, has been reported. While we know a lot about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has been identified yet. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.

Morphology of Satb2 expressing ganglion cells in macaque, human, and marmoset retinas. The study shows that Satb2 expression in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World and New World primate species.







Abstract
In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue‐yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide‐field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide‐field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT‐rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5–4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction‐selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings imply that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.

Abstract
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.

In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.






Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.

Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across 5 sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of evoked potentials (EPs) as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>Impairment of spatial memory, including an inability to recall previous locations and navigate the world, is often one of the first signs of functional disability on the road to cognitive impairment. While there are many screening and diagnostic tools which attempt to measure spatial memory ability, they are often not representative of real-life situations and can therefore lack applicability. One potential solution to this problem involves the use of virtual reality (VR), which immerses individuals in a virtually-simulated environment, allowing for scenarios more representative of real-life without any of the associated risks. Here, we review the evidence surrounding the use of VR for the screening and diagnosis of spatial memory impairments, including potential limitations and how it compares to standard neuropsychological tests. We will also discuss the evidence regarding the potential use of VR in the rehabilitation of spatial memory deficits, which has not been well studied, but which could be game-changing if proven successful.</p>

Abstract
Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that purportedly arises from hypoxia‐ischemia is labeled hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical syndrome involving acidosis, a low Apgar score and the need for resuscitation in the delivery room; asphyxia alerts one to the possibility of NE. In the present systematic review, we focused on the noninflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are involved in the development of possible brain injury in asphyxia or HIE. A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for case–control studies was conducted and 17 studies were found suitable by a priori criteria. Statistical analysis used the Mantel–Haenszel model for dichotomous data. The pooled mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. We identified the best biomarkers, based on the estimation approach in evaluating the biological significance, out of hundreds in three categories: cell adhesion and proliferation, oxidants and antioxidants, and cell damage. The following subtotal‐population comparisons were made: perinatal asphyxia versus no asphyxia, asphyxia with HIE versus asphyxia without HIE, asphyxia with HIE versus no asphyxia, and term versus preterm HIE newborn with asphyxia. Biological significance of the biomarkers was determined by using a modification of the estimation approach, by ranking the biomarkers according to the difference in the bounds of the CIs. The most promising CSF biomarkers for prognostication especially for the severest HIE include creatine kinase, xanthine oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron‐specific enolase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Future studies are recommended using such a combined test to prognosticate the most severely affected patients.

<p>Alterations in the processes that control α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression, assembly and trafficking are closely linked to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We have recently shown that the serine/threonine kinase Protein kinase N1 (PKN1) is a developmentally active regulator of cerebellar synaptic maturation by inhibiting AKT and the neurogenic transcription factor neurogenic differentiation factor-2 (NeuroD2). NeuroD2 is involved in glutamatergic synaptic maturation by regulating expression levels of various synaptic proteins. Here we aimed to study the effect of Pkn1 knockout on AKT phosphorylation and NeuroD2 levels in the hippocampus and the subsequent expression levels of the NeuroD2 targets and AMPAR subunits: glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) and GluA2/3. We show that PKN1 is expressed throughout the hippocampus. Interestingly, not only postnatal but also adult hippocampal phospho-AKT and NeuroD2 levels were significantly elevated upon Pkn1 knockout. Postnatal and adult Pkn1<sup>–/–</sup> hippocampi showed enhanced expression of the AMPAR subunit GluA1, particularly in area CA1. Surprisingly, GluA2/3 levels were not different between both genotypes. In addition to higher protein levels, we also found an enhanced GluA1 content in the membrane fraction of postnatal and adult Pkn1<sup>–/–</sup> animals, while GluA2/3 levels remained unchanged. This points toward a very specific regulation of GluA1 expression and/or trafficking by the novel PKN1-AKT-NeuroD2 axis. Considering the important role of GluA1 in hippocampal development as well as the pathophysiology of several disorders, ranging from Alzheimer’s, to depression and schizophrenia, our results validate PKN1 for future studies into neurological disorders related to altered AMPAR subunit expression in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>In humans, copy number variations in CYFIP1 appear to have sweeping physiological and structural consequences in the brain, either producing or altering the severity of intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. Independently, SynGAP1 haploinsufficiency produces intellectual disability and, frequently, autism. Cyfip1 inhibits protein translation and promotes actin polymerization, and SynGAP1 is a synaptically localized Ras/Rap GAP. While these proteins are clearly distinct, studies investigating their functions in mice have shown that each regulates the maturation of synapses in the hippocampus and haploinsufficiency for either produces an exaggerated form of mGluR-dependent long-term depression, suggesting that some signaling pathways converge. In this study, we examined how Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency impacts SynGAP1 levels and localization, as well as potential sites for mechanistic interaction in mouse hippocampus. The data show that synaptic, but not total, levels of SynGAP1 in Cyfip1<sup>+/–</sup> mice were abnormally low during early postnatal development and in adults. This may be in response to a shift in the balance of kinases that activate SynGAP1 as levels of Cdk5 were reduced and those of activated CaMKII were maintained in Cyfip1<sup>+/–</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. Alternatively, this could reflect altered actin dynamics as Rac1 activity in Cyfip1<sup>+/–</sup> hippocampus was boosted significantly compared to wild-type mice, and levels of synaptic F-actin were generally enhanced due in part to an increase in the activity of the WAVE regulatory complex. Decreased synaptic SynGAP1 coupled with a CaMKII-mediated bias toward Rap1 inactivation at synapses is also consistent with increased levels of synaptic GluA2, increased AMPA receptor-mediated responses to stimulation, and increased levels of synaptic mGluR1/5 compared to wild-type mice. Collectively, our data suggest that Cyfip1 regulates SynGAP1 and the two proteins work coordinately at synapses to appropriately direct actin polymerization and GAP activity.</p>

<p>The α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a fundamental role in inner ear physiology. It mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear fibers that descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the auditory sensory epithelium. The α9 and α10 subunits have undergone a distinct evolutionary history within the family of nAChRs. Predominantly in mammalian vertebrates, the α9α10 receptor has accumulated changes at the protein level that may ultimately relate to the evolutionary history of the mammalian hearing organ. In the present work, we investigated the responses of α9α10 nAChRs to choline, the metabolite of acetylcholine degradation at the synaptic cleft. Whereas choline is a full agonist of chicken α9α10 receptors it is a partial agonist of the rat receptor. Making use of the expression of α9α10 heterologous receptors, encompassing wild-type, heteromeric, homomeric, mutant, chimeric, and hybrid receptors, and in silico molecular docking, we establish that the mammalian (rat) α10 nAChR subunit underscores the reduced efficacy of choline. Moreover, we show that whereas the complementary face of the α10 subunit does not play an important role in the activation of the receptor by ACh, it is strictly required for choline responses. Thus, we propose that the evolutionary changes acquired in the mammalian α9α10 nAChR resulted in the loss of choline acting as a full agonist at the efferent synapse, without affecting the triggering of ACh responses. This may have accompanied the fine-tuning of hair cell post-synaptic responses to the high-frequency activity of efferent medial olivocochlear fibers that modulate the cochlear amplifier.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest the brain functional connectivity impairment is the early event occurred in case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We model the brain as a graph based network to study these impairment. In this paper, we present a new diagnosis approach using graph theory based features from functional magnetic resonance (fMR) images to discriminate AD, MCI, and healthy control (HC) subjects using different classification techniques. These techniques include linear support vector machine (LSVM), and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). We used pairwise Pearson’s correlation-based functional connectivity to construct the brain network. We compare the classification performance of brain network using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) datasets. Node2vec graph embedding approach is employed to convert graph features to feature vectors. Experimental results show that the SVM with LASSO feature selection method generates better classification accuracy compared to other classification technique.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking and other addictive behaviors are among the main preventable risk factors for several severe and potentially fatal diseases. It has been argued that addictive behavior is controlled by an automatic-implicit cognitive system and by a reflective-explicit cognitive system, that operate in parallel to jointly drive human behavior. The present study addresses the formation of implicit attitudes towards smoking in both smokers and non-smokers, using a Go/NoGo association task (GNAT), and behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. The GNAT assesses, via quantifying participants’ reaction times, the strength of association between a target category and either pole of an evaluative dimension (positive or negative). EEG analysis is performed to determine the temporal course of the event-related potential (ERP) components underlying Go/NoGo decisions and implicit attitude formation. Both smokers and non-smokers showed prolonged reaction times to smoking-related pictures when the pictures were coupled with positive evaluative words (“incongruent condition”). This indicates negative implicit attitudes towards smoking in both groups alike at the time point of the behavioral response (600–700 ms post-stimulus). However, only the non-smokers, not the smokers, were found to show a delay of the N200 component in the incongruent condition. This is interpreted as reflecting ambivalent or even positive implicit attitudes towards smoking in the smoker group at the time point of the N200 (300–400 ms post-stimulus). Our study thus provides evidence for the hypothesis that implicit attitudes are subject to changes within several hundred milliseconds after stimulus presentation, and can be altered in the course of their formation.</p>

<p>Background: Recently, attention has grown toward cerebellar neuromodulation in motor learning using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). An important point of discussion regarding this modulation is the optimal timing of tDCS, as this parameter could significantly influence the outcome. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the timing of cerebellar anodal tDCS (ca-tDCS) on motor learning using a sequential finger-tapping task (FTT).</p><p>Methods: One hundred and twenty two healthy young, right-handed subjects (96 females) were randomized into four groups (During<sub>sham</sub>, Before, During<sub>real</sub>, After). They performed 2 days of FTT with their non-dominant hand on a custom keyboard. The task consisted of 40 s of typing followed by 20 s rest. Each participant received ca-tDCS (2 mA, sponge electrodes of 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, 20 min) at the appropriate timing and performed 20 trials on the first day (T1, 20 min). On the following day, only 10 trials of FTT were performed without tDCS (T2, 10 min). Motor skill performance and retention were assessed.</p><p>Results: All participants showed a time-dependent increase in learning. Motor performance was not different between groups at the end of T1 (p = 0.59). ca-tDCS did not facilitate the retention of the motor skill in the FTT at T2 (p = 0.27). Thus, our findings indicate an absence of the effect of ca-tDCS on motor performance or retention of the FTT independently from the timing of stimulation.</p><p>Conclusion: The present results suggest that the outcome of ca-tDCS is highly dependent on the task and stimulation parameters. Future studies need to establish a clear basis for the successful and reproducible clinical application of ca-tDCS.</p>

<p>Increasing student involvement in classes has always been a challenge for teachers and school managers. In online learning, some interactivity mechanisms like quizzes are increasingly used to engage students during classes and tasks. However, there is a high demand for tools that evaluate the efficiency of these mechanisms. In order to distinguish between high and low levels of engagement in tasks, it is possible to monitor brain activity through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The main advantages of this technique are portability, low cost, and a comfortable way for students to concentrate and perform their tasks. This setup provides more natural conditions for the experiments if compared to the other acquisition tools. In this study, we investigated levels of task involvement through the identification of correct and wrong answers of typical quizzes used in virtual environments. We collected data from the prefrontal cortex region (PFC) of 18 students while watching a video lecture. This data was modeled with supervised learning algorithms. We used random forests and penalized logistic regression to classify correct answers as a function of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. These models identify which regions best predict student performance. The random forest and penalized logistic regression (GLMNET with LASSO) obtained, respectively, 0.67 and 0.65 area of the ROC curve. Both models indicate that channels F4-F6 and AF3-AFz are the most relevant for the prediction. The statistical significance of these models was confirmed through cross-validation (leave-one-subject-out) and a permutation test. This methodology can be useful to better understand the teaching and learning processes in a video lecture and also provide improvements in the methodologies used in order to better adapt the presentation content.</p>

<p>A decrease in cortical excitability tends to be easily followed by an increase induced by external stimuli via a mechanism aimed at restoring it; this phenomenon is called “homeostatic plasticity.” In recent years, although intervention methods aimed at promoting motor learning using this phenomenon have been studied, an optimal intervention method has not been established. In the present study, we examined whether subsequent motor learning can be promoted further by a repetitive passive movement, which reduces the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) before motor learning tasks. We also examined the relationship between motor learning and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Forty healthy subjects (Val/Val genotype, 17 subjects; Met carrier genotype, 23 subjects) participated. Subjects were divided into two groups of 20 individuals each. The first group was assigned to perform the motor learning task after an intervention consisting in the passive adduction–abduction movement of the right index finger at 5 Hz for 10 min (RPM condition), while the second group was assigned to perform the task without the passive movement (control condition). The motor learning task consisted in the visual tracking of the right index finger. The results showed that the corticospinal excitability was transiently reduced after the passive movement in the RPM condition, whereas it was increased to the level detected in the control condition after the motor learning task. Furthermore, the motor learning ability was decreased immediately after the passive movement; however, the motor performance finally improved to the level observed in the control condition. In individuals carrying the Val/Val genotype, higher motor learning was also found to be related to the more remarkable changes in corticospinal excitability caused by the RPM condition. This study revealed that the implementation of a passive movement before a motor learning tasks did not affect M1 excitatory changes and motor learning efficiency; in contrast, in subjects carrying the Val/Val polymorphism, the more significant excitatory changes in the M1 induced by the passive movement and motor learning task led to the improvement of motor learning efficiency. Our results also suggest that homeostatic plasticity occurring in the M1 is involved in this improvement.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617626">Examination of the Prefrontal Cortex Hemodynamic Responses to the Fist-Edge-Palm Task in Naïve Subjects Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</a></h4>

<p>The Fist-Edge-Palm (FEP) task, a manual hand task, has been used to detect frontal dysfunctions in clinical situations: its performance failures are observed in various prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related disorders, including schizophrenia. However, previous imaging studies reported that the performance of the FEP task activated motor-related areas, but not the PFC. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationships between the performance of the FEP task and PFC functions. Hemodynamic activity in the PFC, including the dorsolateral PFC (area 46) and frontal pole (area 10), was recorded. Healthy young subjects performed the FEP task as well as a palm tapping (PT) task (control task) three times. The subjects also completed a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA) questionnaire. We found that hemodynamic activity (Oxy-Hb) in the PFC increased in the first trial of the FEP task but decreased considerably in the second and third trials compared to the PT task. The number of performance errors in the FEP task also decreased in the second and third trials. Error reduction (i.e., learning) in the FEP task between the first and second trials was negatively correlated with schizotypal trait and the number of perseveration errors in the WCST. Furthermore, changes in the PFC hemodynamic activity between the first and second trials were positively correlated with error reduction in the FEP task between the first and second trials, and negatively correlated with the number of perseveration errors in the WCST. These results suggest that learning in the FEP task requires PFC activation, which is negatively associated with perseveration errors in the WCST. The results further suggest that the FEP task, in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy, may be useful as a diagnostic method for various disorders with PFC dysfunction.</p>

<p>Motor proficiency reflects the ability to perform precise and coordinated movements in different contexts. Previous research suggests that different profiles of motor proficiency may be associated with different cognitive functioning characteristics thus suggesting an interaction between cognitive and motor processes. The current study investigated this interaction in the general population of healthy adults with different profiles of motor proficiency by focusing on error-related cognitive control and behavioral adaptation mechanisms. In addition, the impact of these processes was assessed in terms of trait anxiety and worries. Forty healthy adults were divided into high and low motor proficiency groups based on an assessment of their motor skills. Using electroencephalography during a flanker task, error-related negativity (ERN) was measured as the neural indicator of cognitive control. Post-error slowing (PES) was measured to represent behavioral adaptation. Participants also completed an anxiety assessment questionnaire. Participants in the high motor proficiency group achieved better task accuracy and showed relatively enhanced cognitive control through increased ERN. Contrastingly, individuals in the lower motor proficiency group achieved poorer accuracy whilst showing some evidence of compensation through increased PES. Trait anxiety reflecting general worries was found to be correlated with motor functioning, but the study could not provide evidence that this was related to cognitive or behavioral control mechanisms. The interaction between cognitive and motor processes observed in this study is unique for healthy and sub-clinical populations and provides a baseline for the interpretation of similar investigations in individuals with motor disorders.</p>

<p>Event-related potential components are sensitive to the processes underlying how questions are understood. We use so-called “covert” wh-questions in Mandarin to probe how such components generalize across different kinds of constructions. This study shows that covert Mandarin wh-questions do not elicit anterior negativities associated with memory maintenance, even when such a dependency is unambiguously cued. N = 37 native speakers of Mandarin Chinese read Chinese questions and declarative sentences word-by-word during EEG recording. In contrast to prior studies, no sustained anterior negativity (SAN) was observed between the cue word, such as the question-embedding verb “wonder,” and the in-situ wh-filler. SANs have been linked with working memory maintenance, suggesting that grammatical features may not impose the same maintenance demands as the content words used in prior work.</p>

<p>Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain (CP), which causes more disability than any other medical condition in the United States at a cost of $560–$635 billion per year (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Opioid analgesics are frequently used to treat CP. However, long term use of opioids can cause brain changes such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia that, over time, increase pain sensation. Also, opioids fail to treat complex psychological factors that worsen pain-related disability, including beliefs about and emotional responses to pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be efficacious for CP. However, CBT generally does not focus on important factors needed for long-term functional improvement, including attainment of personal goals and the psychological flexibility to choose responses to pain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been recognized as an effective, non-pharmacologic treatment for a variety of CP conditions (Gutierrez et al., 2004). However, little is known about the neurologic mechanisms underlying ACT. We conducted an ACT intervention in women (n = 9) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected pre- and post-ACT, and changes in functional connectivity (FC) were measured using Network-Based Statistics (NBS). Behavioral outcomes were measured using validated assessments such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the NIH Toolbox Neuro-QoL<sup>TM</sup> (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders) scales. Results suggest that, following the 4-week ACT intervention, participants exhibited reductions in brain activation within and between key networks including self-reflection (default mode, DMN), emotion (salience, SN), and cognitive control (frontal parietal, FPN). These changes in connectivity strength were correlated with changes in behavioral outcomes including decreased depression and pain interference, and increased participation in social roles. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that improved function across the DMN, SN, and FPN may drive the positive outcomes associated with ACT. This study contributes to the emerging evidence supporting the use of neurophysiological indices to characterize treatment effects of alternative and complementary mind-body therapies.</p>

<p>Introduction: The potential therapeutic efficacy of real-time fMRI Neurofeedback has received increasing attention in a variety of psychological and neurological disorders and as a tool to probe cognition. Despite its growing popularity, the success rate varies significantly, and the underlying neural mechanisms are still a matter of debate. The question whether an individually tailored framework positively influences neurofeedback success remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Methods: To address this question, participants were trained to modulate the activity of a target brain region, the visual motion area hMT+/V5, based on the performance of three imagery tasks with increasing complexity: imagery of a static dot, imagery of a moving dot with two and with four opposite directions. Participants received auditory feedback in the form of vocalizations with either negative, neutral or positive valence. The modulation thresholds were defined for each participant according to the maximum BOLD signal change of their target region during the localizer run.</p><p>Results: We found that 4 out of 10 participants were able to modulate brain activity in this region-of-interest during neurofeedback training. This rate of success (40%) is consistent with the neurofeedback literature. Whole-brain analysis revealed the recruitment of specific cortical regions involved in cognitive control, reward monitoring, and feedback processing during neurofeedback training. Individually tailored feedback thresholds did not correlate with the success level. We found region-dependent neuromodulation profiles associated with task complexity and feedback valence.</p><p>Discussion: Findings support the strategic role of task complexity and feedback valence on the modulation of the network nodes involved in monitoring and feedback control, key variables in neurofeedback frameworks optimization. Considering the elaborate design, the small sample size here tested (N = 10) impairs external validity in comparison to our previous studies. Future work will address this limitation. Ultimately, our results contribute to the discussion of individually tailored solutions, and justify further investigation concerning volitional control over brain activity.</p>

<p>Liquid state machine (LSM) is a type of recurrent spiking network with a strong relationship to neurophysiology and has achieved great success in time series processing. However, the computational cost of simulations and complex dynamics with time dependency limit the size and functionality of LSMs. This paper presents a large-scale bioinspired LSM with modular topology. We integrate the findings on the visual cortex that specifically designed input synapses can fit the activation of the real cortex and perform the Hough transform, a feature extraction algorithm used in digital image processing, without additional cost. We experimentally verify that such a combination can significantly improve the network functionality. The network performance is evaluated using the MNIST dataset where the image data are encoded into spiking series by Poisson coding. We show that the proposed structure can not only significantly reduce the computational complexity but also achieve higher performance compared to the structure of previous reported networks of a similar size. We also show that the proposed structure has better robustness against system damage than the small-world and random structures. We believe that the proposed computationally efficient method can greatly contribute to future applications of reservoir computing.</p>

Indeed, NAA has been a widely accepted biological marker for various neurological disorders. We have also reported that NAA is a protein stabilizer. In the present communication, we investigated the role of NAA in modulating the aggregation propensity on two model proteins (carbonic anhydrase and catalase). We discovered that NAA suppresses protein aggregation and could solubilize preformed aggregates.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating adult brain cancer with high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance. Cellular heterogeneity and extensive invasion of surrounding brain tissues are characteristic features of GBM that contribute to its intractability. Current GBM model systems do not recapitulate some of the complex features of GBM and have not produced sufficiently-effective treatments. This has cast doubt on the effectiveness of current GBM models and drug discovery paradigms. In search of alternative pre-clinical GBM models, various 3D organoid-based GBM model systems have been developed using human cells. The scalability of these systems and potential to more accurately model characteristic features of GBM, provide promising new avenues for pre-clinical GBM research and drug discovery efforts. Here, we review the current suite of organoid-GBM models, their individual strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future applications with an emphasis on compound screening.</p>

<p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a calcium-permeable ion channel best known for its ability to be gated by the pungent constituent of red chili pepper, capsaicin, and related chemicals from the group of vanilloids as well as by noxious heat. As such, it is mostly expressed in sensory neurons to act as a detector of painful stimuli produced by pungent chemicals and high temperatures. Its activation is also sensitized by the numerous endogenous inflammatory mediators and second messengers, making it an important determinant of nociceptive signaling. Except for such signaling, though, neuronal TRPV1 activation may influence various organ functions by promoting the release of bioactive neuropeptides from sensory fiber innervation organs. However, TRPV1 is also found outside the sensory nervous system in which its activation and function is not that straightforward. Thus, TRPV1 expression is detected in skeletal muscle; in some types of smooth muscle; in epithelial and immune cells; and in adipocytes, where it can be activated by the combination of dietary vanilloids, endovanilloids, and pro-inflammatory factors while the intracellular calcium signaling that this initiates can regulate processes as diverse as muscle constriction, cell differentiation, and carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present review is to provide a clear-cut distinction between neurogenic TRPV1 effects in various tissues consequent to its activation in sensory nerve endings and non-neurogenic TRPV1 effects due to its expression in cell types other than sensory neurons.</p>

<p>Current methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia include structured questionnaires, structured interviews, and various cognitive tests. Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%. We propose a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discuss the merits and opportunities of our approach.</p>

<p>Sex-related differences are tied into neurodevelopmental and lifespan processes, beginning early in the perinatal and developmental phases and continue into adulthood. The present study was designed to investigate sexual dimorphism of changes in gray matter (GM) volume in post-adolescence, with a focus on early and middle-adulthood using a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of healthy controls from the European Network on Psychosis, Affective disorders and Cognitive Trajectory (ENPACT). Three hundred and seventy three subjects underwent a 3.0 T MRI session across four European Centers. Age by sex effects on GM volumes were investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas regions (ROI). Females and males showed overlapping and non-overlapping patterns of GM volume changes during aging. Overlapping age-related changes emerged in bilateral frontal and temporal cortices, insula and thalamus. Both VBM and ROI analyses revealed non-overlapping changes in multiple regions, including cerebellum and vermis, bilateral mid frontal, mid occipital cortices, left inferior temporal and precentral gyri. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for sex differences in cross-sectional analyses, not only in the study of normative changes, but particularly in the context of psychiatric and neurologic disorders, wherein sex effects may be confounded with disease-related changes.</p>

Abstract
Reelin plays a key role in neuronal migration and lamination in the cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that reelin expression decreases with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of reelin in all layers of the human hippocampal formation across three age groups. We used immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded hippocampal tissue from infants (1–10 months; n = 9), children (4–10 years; n = 4), and adults (45–60 years; n = 6) to stain for reelin. Expression was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm2) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ML), the hippocampal fissure (HF), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), CA4/Hilus and the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3, CA2, and CA1. Expression of reelin was highest in the HF irrespective of age, followed by the SLM and ML. Minimal to no expression was seen in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1‐3. With age, reelin expression decreased and was statistically significant from infancy to childhood in the HF (p = .02). This study confirms that reelin expression decreases with age in the human hippocampus, and shows for the first time that the major decrease occurs between infancy and early childhood.

Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule with many functions in the nervous system. Derived from the enzymatic conversion of arginine by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS), NO plays significant roles in neuronal developmental events such as the establishment of dendritic branching or arbors. A brief summary of the discovery, molecular biology, and chemistry of NO, and a description of important NO‐mediated signal transduction pathways with emphasis on the role for NO in the development of dendritic branching during neurodevelopment are presented. Important sex differences in neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression during neuronal development are considered. Finally, a survey of endogenous and exogenous substances that disrupt dendritic patterning is presented with particular emphasis on how these molecules may drive NO‐mediated sex differences in dendritic branching.

<p>Disinhibition of orexin-A/hypocretin-1 (OX-A) release occurs to several output areas of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) in the brain of leptin knockout obese ob/ob mice. In this study, we have investigated whether a similar increase of OX-A release occurs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), an orexinergic LH output area with functional effects on dopaminergic signaling at the mesolimbic circuit. By confocal and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) morphological studies coupled to molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches, we investigated OX-A-mediated dopaminergic signaling at the LH-VTA-nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway in obese ob/ob mice compared to wild-type (wt) lean littermates. We found an elevation of OX-A trafficking and release to the VTA of ob/ob mice and consequent orexin receptor-1 (OX1R)-mediated over-activation of dopaminergic (DA) neurons via phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL-α)-induced biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). In fact, by retrograde signaling to cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) at inhibitory inputs to DA neurons, 2-AG inhibited GABA release thus inducing an increase in DA concentration in the VTA and NAc of ob/ob mice. This effect was prevented by the OX1R antagonist SB-334867 (30 mg/Kg, i.p.), or the CB1R antagonist AM251 (10 mg/Kg, i.p.) and mimicked by OX-A injection (40 μg/Kg, i.p.) in wt lean mice. Enhanced DA signaling to the NAc in ob/ob mice, or in OX-A-injected wt mice, was accompanied by β-arrestin2-mediated desensitization of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in a manner prevented by SB-334867 or the D2R antagonist L741 (1.5 mg/Kg, i.p.). These results further support the role of OX-A signaling in the control of neuroadaptive responses, such as compulsive reward-seeking behavior or binge-like consumption of high palatable food, and suggest that aberrant OX-A trafficking to the DA neurons in the VTA of ob/ob mice influences the D2R response at NAc, a main target area of the mesolimbic pathway, via 2-AG/CB1-mediated retrograde signaling.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.613976">The Regulatory Functions of lncRNAs on Angiogenesis Following Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

<p>Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of global mortality and disability. It is a multi-factorial disease involving multiple factors, and gene dysregulation is considered as the major molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. Angiogenesis can promote collateral circulation, which helps the restoration of blood supply in the ischemic area and reduces ischemic necrosis following ischemic injury. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ischemic stroke is associated with various biological functions of endothelial cells and serves essential roles on the angiogenesis of ischemic stroke. The key roles of lncRNAs on angiogenesis suggest their potential as novel therapeutic targets for future diagnosis and treatment. This review elucidates the detailed regulatory functions of lncRNAs on angiogenesis following ischemic stroke through numerous mechanisms, such as interaction with target microRNAs, downstream signaling pathways and target molecules.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.639414">Effects of Excess Brain-Derived Human α-Synuclein on Synaptic Vesicle Trafficking</a></h4>

<p>α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein that regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking under physiological conditions. However, in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, α-synuclein accumulates throughout the neuron, including at synapses, leading to altered synaptic function, neurotoxicity, and motor, cognitive, and autonomic dysfunction. Neurons typically contain both monomeric and multimeric forms of α-synuclein, and it is generally accepted that disrupting the balance between them promotes aggregation and neurotoxicity. However, it remains unclear how distinct molecular species of α-synuclein affect synapses where α-synuclein is normally expressed. Using the lamprey reticulospinal synapse model, we previously showed that acute introduction of excess recombinant monomeric or dimeric α-synuclein impaired distinct stages of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis, leading to a loss of synaptic vesicles. Here, we expand this knowledge by investigating the effects of native, physiological α-synuclein isolated from the brain of a neuropathologically normal human subject, which comprised predominantly helically folded multimeric α-synuclein with a minor component of monomeric α-synuclein. After acute introduction of excess brain-derived human α-synuclein, there was a moderate reduction in the synaptic vesicle cluster and an increase in the number of large, atypical vesicles called “cisternae.” In addition, brain-derived α-synuclein increased synaptic vesicle and cisternae sizes and induced atypical fusion/fission events at the active zone. In contrast to monomeric or dimeric α-synuclein, the brain-derived multimeric α-synuclein did not appear to alter clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Taken together, these data suggest that excess brain-derived human α-synuclein impairs intracellular vesicle trafficking and further corroborate the idea that different molecular species of α-synuclein produce distinct trafficking defects at synapses. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which excess α-synuclein contributes to synaptic deficits and disease phenotypes.</p>

<p>Electroencephalographic activity over the sensorimotor cortex has been one of the best studied targets for neurofeedback therapy. Parkinson’s disease patients display abnormal brain rhythms in the motor cortex caused by increased synchrony in the basal ganglia-cortical pathway. Few studies have examined the effects of sensorimotor-based neurofeedback therapy in humans with PD. In this pilot study, one patient, diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease 10 years prior, participated in two consecutive days of EEG neurofeedback training to increase sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) power over the motor cortex. Using a visual display connected to ongoing EEG, the patient voluntarily manipulated SMR power, and he/she was awarded with points to positively reinforce successful increases over a predefined threshold. Recorded EEG data were source localized and analyzed for the occurrence of high amplitude bursts of SMR activity as well as bursts in the beta frequency band in the precentral cortex. The rate of SMR bursts increased with each subsequent training session, while the rate of beta bursts only increased on the final session. Relative power in the beta band, a marker of PD symptom severity, decreased over the motor cortex in the later session. These results provide first evidence for the feasibility of SMR neurofeedback training as a non-invasive therapy for reducing Parkinson’s disease related activity and upregulating SMR in the human motor cortex.</p>

<p>Computational visual encoding models play a key role in understanding the stimulus–response characteristics of neuronal populations in the brain visual cortex. However, building such models typically faces challenges in the effective construction of non-linear feature spaces to fit the neuronal responses. In this work, we propose the GaborNet visual encoding (GaborNet-VE) model, a novel end-to-end encoding model for the visual ventral stream. This model comprises a Gabor convolutional layer, two regular convolutional layers, and a fully connected layer. The key design principle for the GaborNet-VE model is to replace regular convolutional kernels in the first convolutional layer with Gabor kernels with learnable parameters. One GaborNet-VE model efficiently and simultaneously encodes all voxels in one region of interest of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance for the primary visual cortex. Moreover, the visualizations demonstrate the regularity of the region of interest fitting to the visual features and the estimated receptive fields. These results suggest that the lightweight region-based GaborNet-VE model based on combining handcrafted and deep learning features exhibits good expressiveness and biological interpretability.</p>

<p>Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has become a priority in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research, as it is a transitional phase between normal aging and dementia. However, information on MCI and AD is scattered across different formats and standards generated by different technologies, making it difficult to work with them manually. Ontologies have emerged as a solution to this problem due to their capacity for homogenization and consensus in the representation and reuse of data. In this context, an ontology that integrates the four main domains of neurodegenerative diseases, diagnostic tests, cognitive functions, and brain areas will be of great use in research. Here, we introduce the first approach to this ontology, the Neurocognitive Integrated Ontology (NIO), which integrates the knowledge regarding neuropsychological tests (NT), AD, cognitive functions, and brain areas. This ontology enables interoperability and facilitates access to data by integrating dispersed knowledge across different disciplines, rendering it useful for other research groups. To ensure the stability and reusability of NIO, the ontology was developed following the ontology-building life cycle, integrating and expanding terms from four different reference ontologies. The usefulness of this ontology was validated through use-case scenarios.</p>

<p>Backgrounds: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique for the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, e.g., mood disorders and schizophrenia. Therapeutic effects of tDCS are suggested to be produced by bi-directional changes in cortical activities, i.e., increased/decreased cortical excitability via anodal/cathodal stimulation. Although tDCS provides a promising approach for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, its neurobiological mechanisms remain to be explored.</p><p>Objectives: To review recent findings from neurophysiological, chemical, and brain-network studies, and consider how tDCS ameliorates psychiatric conditions.</p><p>Findings: Enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmissions through anodal tDCS stimulation is likely to facilitate glutamate transmission and suppress gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission in the cortex. On the other hand, it positively or negatively modulates the activities of dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine transmissions in the central nervous system. These neural events by tDCS may change the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Specifically, multi-session tDCS is thought to promote/regulate information processing efficiency in the cerebral cortical circuit, which induces long-term potentiation (LTP) by synthesizing various proteins.</p><p>Conclusions: This review will help understand putative mechanisms underlying the clinical benefits of tDCS from the perspective of neurotransmitters, network dynamics, intracellular events, and related modalities of the brain function.</p>

<p>Visuomotor adaptation to novel environments can occur via non-physical means, such as observation. Observation does not appear to activate the same implicit learning processes as physical practice, rather it appears to be more strategic in nature. However, there is evidence that interspersing observational practice with physical practice can benefit performance and memory consolidation either through the combined benefits of separate processes or through a change in processes activated during observation trials. To test these ideas, we asked people to practice aiming to targets with visually rotated cursor feedback or engage in a combined practice schedule comprising physical practice and observation of projected videos showing successful aiming. Ninety-three participants were randomly assigned to one of five groups: massed physical practice (Act), distributed physical practice (Act+Rest), or one of 3 types of combined practice: alternating blocks (Obs_During), or all observation before (Obs_Pre) or after (Obs_Post) blocked physical practice. Participants received 100 practice trials (all or half were physical practice). All groups improved in adaptation trials and showed savings across the 24-h retention interval relative to initial practice. There was some forgetting for all groups, but the magnitudes were larger for physical practice groups. The Act and Obs_During groups were most accurate in retention and did not differ, suggesting that observation can serve as a replacement for physical practice if supplied intermittently and offers advantages above just resting. However, after-effects associated with combined practice were smaller than those for physical practice control groups, suggesting that beneficial learning effects as a result of observation were not due to activation of implicit learning processes. Reaction time, variable error, and post-test rotation drawings supported this conclusion that adaptation for observation groups was promoted by explicit/strategic processes.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate the correlation between preoperative response to the L-dopa challenge test and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor function in Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p><p>Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 38 patients with idiopathic PD who underwent DBS surgery with a median follow-up duration of 7 months. Twenty underwent bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS, and 18 underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Motor Part (MDS UPDRS-III) was assessed before surgery and at the last follow-up in different medication and stimulation conditions, respectively.</p><p>Results: Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness and GPi-DBS responsiveness on the total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.283, p = 0.016) but not on the non-tremor total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.158, p = 0.083) of MDS UPDRS-III. Such correlation remained significant (R<sup>2</sup>′ = 0.332, p = 0.010) after controlling for age at the time of surgery as confounding factor by partial correlation analysis. The preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness was significantly correlated with the tremor-controlling outcome of GPi-DBS (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.390, p = 0.003). In contrast, we found a positive correlation between preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness and STN-DBS responsiveness on the non-tremor total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.290, p = 0.021), but not on the total score (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.130, p = 0.141) of MDS UPDRS-III. The partial correlation analysis further demonstrated that the predictive value of preoperative L-dopa challenge responsiveness on the non-tremor motor outcome of STN-DBS was eliminated (R<sup>2</sup>′ = 0.120, p = 0.174) after controlling for age at the time of surgery as confounding factor.</p><p>Interpretation: The short-term predictive value of preoperative response to the L-dopa challenge test for the motor outcome of GPi-DBS in PD was systematically described. Our findings suggest: (1) a solid therapeutic effect of GPi-DBS in treating L-dopa-responsive tremors; (2) a negative effect of age at the time of surgery on motor outcomes of STN-DBS, (3) a possible preference of STN- to GPi-DBS in L-dopa-resistant tremor control, and (4) a possible preference of GPi- to STN-DBS in elderly PD patients who have a satisfactory dopamine response.</p>

<p>Skill transfer from trained balance exercises is critical to reduce the rate of falls in older adults, who rely more on vision to control postural responses due to age-dependent sensory reweighting. With an electroencephalography (EEG) minimum spanning tree (MST) structure, the purpose of this study was to compare the organization of supraspinal neural networks of transfer effect after postural training using full and intermittent visual feedbacks for older adults. Thirty-two older adults were randomly assigned to the stroboscopic vision (SV) (n = 16; age = 64.7 ± 3.0 years) and control (16; 66.3 ± 2.7 years) groups for balance training on a stabilometer (target task) with on-line visual feedback. Center-of-pressure characteristics and an MST-based connectome of the weighted phase-lag index during the bilateral stance on a foam surface (transfer task) were compared before and after stabilometer training. The results showed that both the SV and control groups showed improvements in postural stability in the trained task (p &lt; 0.001). However, unlike the control group (p = 0.030), the SV group who received intermittent visual feedback during the stabilometer training failed to reduce the size of postural sway in the anteroposterior direction of the postural transfer task (unstable stance on the foam surface) in the post-test (p = 0.694). In addition, network integration for the transfer task in the post-test was absent in the SV group (p &gt; 0.05). For the control group in the post-test, it manifested with training-related increases in leaf fraction in beta band (p = 0.015) and maximum betweenness in alpha band (p = 0.018), but a smaller diameter in alpha (p = 0.006)/beta (p = 0.021) bands and average eccentricity in alpha band (p = 0.028). In conclusion, stabilometer training with stroboscopic vision impairs generalization of postural skill to unstable stance for older adults. Adequate visual information is a key mediating factor of supraspinal neural networks to carry over balance skill in older adults.</p>

<p>Purpose: Loss of grip strength and cognitive impairment are prevalent in the elderly, and they may share the pathogenesis in common. Several original studies have investigated the association between them, but the results remained controversial. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to quantitatively determine the relationship between baseline grip strength and the risk of cognitive impairment and provide evidence for clinical work.</p><p>Methods: We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science up to March 23, 2020, and focused on the association between baseline grip strength and onset of cognitive impairment. Next, we conducted a meta-analysis using a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect measures. Heterogeneity between the studies was examined using I<sup>2</sup> and p-value. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed, and publication bias was assessed by Begg's and Egger's tests.</p><p>Results: Fifteen studies were included in this systematic review. After sensitivity analyses, poorer grip strength was associated with more risk of cognitive decline and dementia (HR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.71–2.32; HR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.32–1.79, respectively). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that people with poorer strength had more risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia (HR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.09–1.81; HR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.10–1.91, respectively).</p><p>Conclusions: Lower grip strength is associated with more risk of onset of cognitive decline and dementia despite of subtype of dementia.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.608736">One Hour-Post-load Plasma Glucose ≥155 mg/dl in Healthy Glucose Normotolerant Subjects Is Associated With Subcortical Brain MRI Alterations and Impaired Cognition: A Pilot Study</a></h4>

<p>Background: Glucose alterations are associated with impaired cognition. The 1-h-post-load plasma glucose ≥155 mg/dl in non-diabetic subjects confers an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes. This pilot study aimed to investigate whether the 1-h-post-load plasma glucose ≥155 mg/dl negatively affects the subcortical regions of the brain and the cognitive functions.</p><p>Methods: We enrolled 32 non-diabetic subjects. Patients were divided into two groups based on 1-h- post-load plasma glucose value &gt; or &lt; 155 mg/dl: normal glucose tolerance (NGT) 1-h-high and NGT 1-h-low subjects. All subjects underwent 3 Tesla MRI and standard neuropsychological tests.</p><p>Results: NGT 1-h-high subjects showed significantly lower values of both right (4.9 ± 0.9 vs. 5.1 ± 0.9 ml) and left (4.8 ± 1.1 vs. 5.1 ± 1.1 ml) hippocampal hemisphere volume, while right hemisphere hippocampal diffusivity was lower in the NGT 1-h-high group (10.0 ± 0.6 vs. 10.6 ± 0.5 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>). NGT 1-h-high subjects also showed a poorer memory performance. In particular, for both Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT)—immediate-recall and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT)—delayed total recall, we found lower cognitive test scores in the NGT-1 h-high group (26.5 ± 6.3 and 10.4 ± 0.3, respectively).</p><p>Conclusions: One-hour-post-load hyperglycemia is associated with morpho-functional subcortical brain alterations and poor memory performance tests.</p>
