	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain’s evoked and induced electrical activity from the scalp. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we investigated if individuals with neurogenic speech sound impairments of three types, Parkinson’s dysarthria, apraxia of speech, and aphasic phonological impairment, accommodate their speech to the natural speech rhythm of an auditory model, and if so, whether the effect is more significant after hearing metrically regular sentences as compared to those with an irregular pattern. This question builds on theories of rhythmic entrainment, assuming that sensorimotor predictions of upcoming events allow humans to synchronize their actions with an external rhythm. To investigate entrainment effects, we conducted a sentence completion task relating participants’ response latencies to the spoken rhythm of the prime heard immediately before. A further research question was if the perceived rhythm interacts with the rhythm of the participants’ own productions, i.e., the trochaic or iambic stress pattern of disyllabic target words. For a control group of healthy speakers, our study revealed evidence for entrainment when trochaic target words were preceded by regularly stressed prime sentences. Persons with Parkinson’s dysarthria showed a pattern similar to that of the healthy individuals. For the patient groups with apraxia of speech and with phonological impairment, considerably longer response latencies with differing patterns were observed. Trochaic target words were initiated with significantly shorter latencies, whereas the metrical regularity of prime sentences had no consistent impact on response latencies and did not interact with the stress pattern of the target words to be produced. The absence of an entrainment in these patients may be explained by the more severe difficulties in initiating speech at all. We discuss the results in terms of clinical implications for diagnostics and therapy in neurogenic speech disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">From Progenitors to Progeny: Shaping Striatal Circuit Development and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding how neurons of the striatum are formed and integrate into complex synaptic circuits is essential to provide insight into striatal function in health and disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the development of striatal neurons and associated circuits with a focus on their embryonic origin. Specifically, we address the role of distinct types of embryonic progenitors, found in the proliferative zones of the ganglionic eminences in the ventral telencephalon, in the generation of diverse striatal interneurons and projection neurons. Indeed, recent evidence would suggest that embryonic progenitor origin dictates key characteristics of postnatal cells, including their neurochemical content, their location within striatum, and their long-range synaptic inputs. We also integrate recent observations regarding embryonic progenitors in cortical and other regions and discuss how this might inform future research on the ganglionic eminences. Last, we examine how embryonic progenitor dysfunction can alter striatal formation, as exemplified in Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder, and how increased understanding of embryonic progenitors can have significant implications for future research directions and the development of improved therapeutic options.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This review highlights recently defined novel roles for embryonic progenitor cells in shaping the functional properties of both projection neurons and interneurons of the striatum. It outlines the developmental mechanisms that guide neuronal development from progenitors in the embryonic ganglionic eminences to progeny in the striatum. Where questions remain open, we integrate observations from cortex and other regions to present possible avenues for future research. Last, we provide a progenitor-centric perspective onto both Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder. We suggest that future investigations and manipulations of embryonic progenitor cells in both research and clinical settings will likely require careful consideration of their great intrinsic diversity and neurogenic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Glycine Release Is Potentiated by cAMP via EPAC2 and Ca2+ Stores in a Retinal Interneuron</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuromodulation via the intracellular second messenger cAMP is ubiquitous at presynaptic nerve terminals. This modulation of synaptic transmission allows exocytosis to adapt to stimulus levels and reliably encode information. The AII amacrine cell (AII-AC) is a central hub for signal processing in the mammalian retina. The main apical dendrite of the AII-AC is connected to several lobular appendages that release glycine onto OFF cone bipolar cells and ganglion cells. However, the influence of cAMP on glycine release is not well understood. Using membrane capacitance measurements from mouse AII-ACs to directly measure exocytosis, we observe that intracellular dialysis of 1 m<scp>m</scp> cAMP enhances exocytosis without affecting the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Responses to depolarizing pulses of various durations show that the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles nearly doubles with cAMP, while paired-pulse depression experiments suggest that release probability does not change. Specific agonists and antagonists for exchange protein activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) revealed that the cAMP-induced enhancement of exocytosis requires EPAC2 activation. Furthermore, intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores were also necessary for the cAMP potentiation of exocytosis. Postsynaptic recordings from OFF cone bipolar cells showed that increasing cAMP with forskolin potentiated the frequency of glycinergic spontaneous IPSCs. We propose that cAMP elevations in the AII-AC lead to a robust enhancement of glycine release through an EPAC2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> store signaling pathway. Our results thus contribute to a better understanding of how AII-AC crossover inhibitory circuits adapt to changes in ambient luminance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian retina operates over a wide dynamic range of light intensities and contrast levels. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of processed visual information, both excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the retina must modulate their gain in synaptic transmission to adapt to different levels of ambient light. Here we show that increases of cAMP concentration within AII amacrine cells produce enhanced exocytosis from these glycinergic interneurons. Therefore, we propose that light-sensitive neuromodulators may change the output of glycine release from AII amacrine cells. This novel mechanism may fine-tune the amount of tonic and phasic synaptic inhibition received by bipolar cell terminals and, consequently, the spiking patterns that ganglion cells send to the upstream visual areas of the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Endocannabinoids Tune Intrinsic Excitability in O-LM Interneurons by Direct Modulation of Postsynaptic Kv7 Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>KCNQ-Kv7 channels are found at the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons, where they control cell firing and membrane potential. In oriens lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, these channels are mainly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a peculiar function of Kv7 channels in these neurons. Here, we show that Kv7 channel activity is upregulated following induction of presynaptic long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in O-LM interneurons from rats of both sex, thus resulting in a synergistic long-term depression of intrinsic excitability (LTD-IE). Both LTD and LTD-IE involve endocannabinoid (eCB) biosynthesis for induction. However, although LTD is dependent on cannabinoid type 1 receptors, LTD-IE is not. Molecular modeling shows a strong interaction of eCBs with Kv7.2/3 channel, suggesting a persistent action of these lipids on Kv7 channel activity. Our data thus unveil a major role for eCB synthesis in triggering both synaptic and intrinsic depression in O-LM interneurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In principal cells, Kv7 channels are essentially located at the axon initial segment. In contrast, in O-LM interneurons, Kv7 channels are highly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a singular role of these channels in O-LM cell function. Here, we show that LTD of excitatory inputs in O-LM interneurons is associated with an upregulation of Kv7 channels, thus resulting in a synergistic LTD of LTD-IE. Both forms of plasticity are mediated by the biosynthesis of eCBs. Stimulation of CB1 receptors induces LTD, whereas the direct interaction of eCBs with Kv7 channels induces LTD-IE. Our results thus provide a previously unexpected involvement of eCBs in long-lasting plasticity of intrinsic excitability in GABAergic interneurons.</p>

Previous anatomic and molecular data suggest that LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons may be parsed into at least two distinct subpopulations, one of which is enriched in neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), the receptor for neurokinin B (NKB), encoded by the <I>Tac2</I> gene. This tachykininergic ligand-receptor system has been implicated in reproduction, fear memory, and stress in other brain regions, but NKB interactions with LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons are poorly understood. We first identified how LHA<sup>MCH</sup> subpopulations may be distinguished anatomically and electrophysiologically. To dissect functional connectivity between NKB-expressing neurons and LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons, we used Cre-dependent retrograde and anterograde viral tracing in male <I>Tac2-</I>Cre mice and identified <I>Tac2</I>/EYFP+ neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala, the central extended amygdala, as major sources of NKB input onto LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons. In addition to innervating the LHA, these limbic forebrain NKB neurons also project to midbrain and brainstem targets. Finally, using a dual-virus approach, we found that optogenetic activation of these inputs in slices evokes GABA release onto a subset of LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons but lacked specificity for the NK3R+ subpopulation. Overall, these data define parallel tachykininergic/GABAergic limbic forebrain projections that are positioned to modulate multiple nodes of homeostatic and behavioral control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The LHA orchestrates fundamental behavioral states in the mammalian hypothalamus, including arousal, energy balance, memory, stress, and motivated behavior. The neuropeptide MCH defines one prominent population of LHA neurons, with multiple roles in the regulation of homeostatic behavior. Outstanding questions remain concerning the upstream inputs that control MCH neurons. We sought to define neurochemically distinct pathways in the mouse brain that may communicate with specific MCH neuron subpopulations using viral-based retrograde and anterograde neural pathway tracing and optogenetics in brain slices. Here, we identify a specific neuropeptide-defined forebrain circuit that makes functional synaptic connections with MCH neuron subpopulations. This work lays the foundation for further manipulating molecularly distinct neural circuits that modulate innate behavioral states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociated Role of Thalamic and Cortical Input to the Lateral Amygdala for Consolidation of Long-Term Fear Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-encoding coordinated reactivation of memory traces distributed throughout interconnected brain regions is thought to be critical for consolidation of memories. However, little is known about the role of neural circuit pathways during post-learning periods for consolidation of memories. To investigate this question, we optogenetically silenced the inputs from both auditory cortex and thalamus in the lateral amygdala (LA) for 15 min immediately following auditory fear conditioning (FC) and examined its effect on fear memory formation in mice of both sexes. Optogenetic inhibition of both inputs disrupted long-term fear memory formation tested 24 h after FC. This effect was specific such that the same inhibition did not affect short-term memory and context-dependent memory. Moreover, long-term memory was intact if the inputs were inhibited at much later time points after FC (3 h or 1 d after FC), indicating that optical inhibition for 15 min itself does not produce any nonspecific deleterious effect on fear memory retrieval. Selective inhibition of thalamic input was sufficient to impair consolidation of auditory fear memory. In contrast, selective inhibition of cortical input disrupted remote fear memory without affecting recent memory. These results reveal a dissociated role of thalamic and cortical input to the LA during early post-learning periods for consolidation of long-term fear memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordinated communications between brain regions are thought to be essential during post-learning periods for consolidation of memories. However, the role of specific neural circuit pathways in this process has been scarcely explored. Using a precise optogenetic inhibition of auditory input pathways, either thalamic or cortical or both, to the LA during post-training periods, we here show that thalamic input is required for consolidation of both recent and remote fear memory, whereas cortical input is crucial for consolidation of remote fear memory. These results reveal a dissociated role of auditory input pathways to the LA for consolidation of long-term fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Constructing Others' Beliefs from One's Own Using Medial Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many daily choices are based on one's own knowledge. However, when predicting other people's behavior, we need to consider the differences between our knowledge and other people's presumed knowledge. Social agents need a mechanism to use privileged information for their own behavior but exclude it from predictions of others. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural implementation of such social and personal predictions in healthy human volunteers of both sexes by manipulating privileged and shared information. The medial frontal cortex appeared to have an important role in flexibly making decisions using privileged information for oneself or predicting others' behavior. Specifically, we show that ventromedial PFC tracked the state of the world independent of the type of decision (personal, social), whereas dorsomedial regions adjusted their frame of reference to the use of privileged or shared information. Sampling privileged evidence not available to another person also relied on specific interactions between temporoparietal junction area and frontal pole.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> What we know about the minds of others and how we use that information is crucial to understanding social interaction. Mentalizing, or reading the minds of others, is argued to be particularly well developed in the human and crucially affected in some disorders. However, the intractable nature of human interactions makes it very difficult to study these processes. Here, we present a way to objectively quantify the information people have about others and to investigate how their brain deals with this information. This shows that people use similar areas in the brain related to nonsocial decision-making when making decisions in social situations and modify this information processing by the knowledge about others use these to modify their information processing according to the knowledge of others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Alpha Oscillations Shape Sensory Representation and Perceptual Sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alpha activity (8&ndash;14 Hz) is the dominant rhythm in the awake brain and is thought to play an important role in setting the internal state of the brain. Previous work has associated states of decreased alpha power with enhanced neural excitability. However, evidence is mixed on whether and how such excitability enhancement modulates sensory signals of interest versus noise differently, and what, if any, are the consequences for subsequent perception. Here, human subjects (male and female) performed a visual detection task in which we manipulated their decision criteria in a blockwise manner. Although our manipulation led to substantial criterion shifts, these shifts were not reflected in prestimulus alpha band changes. Rather, lower prestimulus alpha power in occipital-parietal areas improved perceptual sensitivity and enhanced information content decodable from neural activity patterns. Additionally, oscillatory alpha phase immediately before stimulus presentation modulated accuracy. Together, our results suggest that alpha band dynamics modulate sensory signals of interest more strongly than noise.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The internal state of our brain fluctuates, giving rise to variability in perception and action. Neural oscillations, most prominently in the alpha band, have been suggested to play a role in setting this internal state. Here, we show that ongoing alpha band activity in occipital-parietal regions predicts the quality of visual information decodable in neural activity patterns and subsequently the human observer's sensitivity in a visual detection task. Our results provide comprehensive evidence that visual representation is modulated by ongoing alpha band activity and advance our understanding on how, when faced with unchanging external stimuli, internal neural fluctuations influence perception and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Awareness-Dependent Normalization Framework of Visual Bottom-up Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although bottom-up attention can improve visual performance with and without awareness to the exogenous cue, whether they are governed by a common neural computation remains unclear. Using a modified Posner paradigm with backward masking, we found that the cueing effect displayed a monotonic gradient profile (Gaussian-like), both with and without awareness, whose scope, however, was significantly wider with than without awareness. This awareness-dependent scope offered us a unique opportunity to change the relative size of the attention field to the stimulus, differentially modulating the gain of attentional selection, as proposed by the normalization model of attention. Therefore, for each human subject (male and female), the stimulus size was manipulated as their respective mean attention fields with and without awareness while stimulus contrast was varied in a spatial cueing task. By measuring the gain pattern of contrast-response functions on the spatial cueing effect derived by visible or invisible cues, we observed changes in the cueing effect consonant with changes in contrast gain for visible cues and response gain for invisible cues. Importantly, a complementary analysis confirmed that subjects' awareness-dependent attention fields can be simulated by using the normalization model of attention. Together, our findings indicate an awareness-dependent normalization framework of visual bottom-up attention, placing a necessary constraint, namely, awareness, on our understanding of the neural computations underlying visual attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bottom-up attention is known to improve visual performance with and without awareness. We discovered that manipulating subjects' awareness can modulate their attention fields of visual bottom-up attention, which offers a unique opportunity to regulate its normalization processes. On the one hand, by measuring the gain pattern of contrast-response functions on the spatial cueing effect derived by visible or invisible cues, we observed changes in the cueing effect consonant with changes in contrast gain for visible cues and response gain for invisible cues. On the other hand, by using the normalization model of attention, subjects' awareness-dependent attention fields can be simulated successfully. Our study supports important predictions of the normalization model of visual bottom-up attention and further reveals its dependence on awareness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Memory Reactivation during Sleep Improves Execution of a Challenging Motor Skill</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep reinforces various types of learning. Basic motor skills likely benefit from sleep. There is insufficient evidence, however, on whether memory reactivation during sleep contributes to learning how to execute a novel action. Here, we investigated motor learning in a myoelectric feedback task. Human male and female participants learned to control myoelectric activity in specific arm muscles to move a computer cursor to each of 16 locations. Each location was associated with a unique sound. Half of the sounds were played during slow-wave sleep to reactivate corresponding memories of muscle control. After sleep, movements cued during sleep were performed more quickly and efficiently than uncued movements. These results demonstrated that memory reactivation during sleep contributes to learning of action execution. We conclude that sleep supports learning novel actions, which also maps onto the learning required in certain neurorehabilitation procedures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior literature on motor learning has produced much evidence supporting a role for sleep but scant evidence on the execution component. This aspect of learning is critical for many complex skills that people value in their lives. Our results not only implicate sleep in skill learning but also pinpoint a benefit for motor execution using a method for modifying memory storage during sleep. We used targeted memory reactivation (TMR), whereby a stimulus that has been associated with learning is presented again during sleep to bring on a recapitulation of waking brain activity. Our demonstration that memory reactivation contributed to skilled performance may be relevant for neurorehabilitation as well as fields concerned with motor learning, such as kinesiology and physiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampus-Prefrontal Coupling Regulates Recognition Memory for Novelty Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recognition memory provides the ability to distinguish familiar from novel objects and places, and is important for recording and updating events to guide appropriate behavior. The hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have both been implicated in recognition memory, but the nature of HPC&ndash;mPFC interactions, and its impact on local circuits in mediating this process is not known. Here we show that novelty discrimination is accompanied with higher theta activity (4&ndash;10 Hz) and increased c-Fos expression in both these regions. Moreover, theta oscillations were highly coupled between the HPC and mPFC during recognition memory retrieval for novelty discrimination, with the HPC leading the mPFC, but not during initial learning. Principal neurons and interneurons in the mPFC responded more strongly during recognition memory retrieval compared with learning. Optogenetic silencing of HPC input to the mPFC disrupted coupled theta activity between these two structures, as well as the animals' (male Sprague Dawley rats) ability to differentiate novel from familiar objects. These results reveal a key role of monosynaptic connections between the HPC and mPFC in novelty discrimination via theta coupling and identify neural populations that underlie this recognition memory-guided behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many memory processes are highly dependent on the interregional communication between the HPC and mPFC via neural oscillations. However, how these two brain regions coordinate their oscillatory activity to engage local neural populations to mediate recognition memory for novelty discrimination is poorly understood. This study revealed that the HPC and mPFC theta oscillations and their temporal coupling is correlated with recognition memory-guided behavior. During novel object recognition, the HPC drives mPFC interneurons to effectively reduce the activity of principal neurons. This study provides the first evidence for the requirement of the HPC&ndash;mPFC pathway to mediate recognition memory for novelty discrimination and describes a mechanism for how this memory is regulated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cnksr2 Loss in Mice Leads to Increased Neural Activity and Behavioral Phenotypes of Epilepsy-Aphasia Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epilepsy Aphasia Syndromes (EAS) are a spectrum of childhood epileptic, cognitive, and language disorders of unknown etiology. <I>CNKSR2</I> is a strong X-linked candidate gene implicated in EAS; however, there have been no studies of genetic models to dissect how its absence may lead to EAS. Here we develop a novel <I>Cnksr2</I> KO mouse line and show that male mice exhibit increased neural activity and have spontaneous electrographic seizures. <I>Cnksr2</I> KO mice also display significantly increased anxiety, impaired learning and memory, and a progressive and dramatic loss of ultrasonic vocalizations. We find that Cnksr2 is expressed in cortical, striatal, and cerebellar regions and is localized at both excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses. Proteomics analysis reveals Cnksr2 anchors key binding partners at synapses, and its loss results in significant alterations of the synaptic proteome, including proteins implicated in epilepsy disorders. Our results validate that loss of CNKSR2 leads to EAS and highlights the roles of Cnksr2 in synaptic organization and neuronal network activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy Aphasia Syndromes (EAS) are at the severe end of a spectrum of cognitive-behavioral symptoms seen in childhood epilepsies, and they remain an inadequately understood disorder. The prognosis of EAS is frequently poor, and patients have life-long language and cognitive disturbances. Here we describe a genetic mouse model of EAS, based on the KO of the EAS risk gene <I>Cnksr2</I>. We show that these mice exhibit electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes similar to those of patients, providing an important new model for future studies of EAS. We also provide insights into the molecular disturbances downstream of Cnksr2 loss by using <I>in vivo</I> quantitative proteomics tools.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Response Dynamics and Increased Population Correlation to Tonal Stimuli Embedded in Noise in Aging Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a chronic health condition that affects one-third of the world population. One hallmark of presbycusis is a difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Presbycusis can be separated into two components: alterations of peripheral mechanotransduction of sound in the cochlea and central alterations of auditory processing areas of the brain. Although the effects of the aging cochlea in hearing loss have been well studied, the role of the aging brain in hearing loss is less well understood. Therefore, to examine how age-related central processing changes affect hearing in noisy environments, we used a mouse model (Thy1-GCaMP6s X CBA) that has excellent peripheral hearing in old age. We used <I>in vivo</I> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to measure the responses of neuronal populations in auditory cortex (ACtx) of adult (2&ndash;6 months, nine male, six female, 4180 neurons) and aging mice (15&ndash;17 months, six male, three female, 1055 neurons) while listening to tones in noisy backgrounds. We found that ACtx neurons in aging mice showed larger responses to tones and have less suppressed responses consistent with reduced inhibition. Aging neurons also showed less sensitivity to temporal changes. Population analysis showed that neurons in aging mice showed higher pairwise activity correlations and showed a reduced diversity in responses to sound stimuli. Using neural decoding techniques, we show a loss of information in neuronal populations in the aging brain. Thus, aging not only affects the responses of single neurons but also affects how these neurons jointly represent stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging results in hearing deficits particularly under challenging listening conditions. We show that auditory cortex contains distinct subpopulations of excitatory neurons that preferentially encode different stimulus features and that aging selectively reduces certain subpopulations. We also show that aging increases correlated activity between neurons and thereby reduces the response diversity in auditory cortex. The loss of population response diversity leads to a decrease of stimulus information and deficits in sound encoding, especially in noisy backgrounds. Future work determining the identities of circuits affected by aging could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deficits in Behavioral and Neuronal Pattern Separation in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>In temporal lobe epilepsy, the ability of the dentate gyrus to limit excitatory cortical input to the hippocampus breaks down, leading to seizures. The dentate gyrus is also thought to help discriminate between similar memories by performing pattern separation, but whether epilepsy leads to a breakdown in this neural computation, and thus to mnemonic discrimination impairments, remains unknown. Here we show that temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by behavioral deficits in mnemonic discrimination tasks, in both humans (females and males) and mice (C57Bl6 males, systemic low-dose kainate model). Using a recently developed assay in brain slices of the same epileptic mice, we reveal a decreased ability of the dentate gyrus to perform certain forms of pattern separation. This is because of a subset of granule cells with abnormal bursting that can develop independently of early EEG abnormalities. Overall, our results linking physiology, computation, and cognition in the same mice advance our understanding of episodic memory mechanisms and their dysfunction in epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have learning and memory impairments, sometimes occurring earlier than the first seizure, but those symptoms and their biological underpinnings are poorly understood. We focused on the dentate gyrus, a brain region that is critical to avoid confusion between similar memories and is anatomically disorganized in TLE. We show that both humans and mice with TLE experience confusion between similar situations. This impairment coincides with a failure of the dentate gyrus to disambiguate similar input signals because of pathologic bursting in a subset of neurons. Our work bridges seizure-oriented and memory-oriented views of the dentate gyrus function, suggests a mechanism for cognitive symptoms in TLE, and supports a long-standing hypothesis of episodic memory theories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TRPM4 Contributes to Subthreshold Membrane Potential Oscillations in Multiple Mouse Pacemaker Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Select neuronal populations display steady rhythmic neuronal firing that provides tonic excitation to drive downstream networks and behaviors. In noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), circadian neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup>-activated neurons of the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), large subthreshold membrane potential oscillations contribute to the pacemaker-like action potential discharge. The oscillations and firing in LC and SCN involve contributions from leak sodium (NALCN) and L-type calcium channels while recent work from RTN suggested an additional pivotal role for a secondary calcium-activated and voltage-gated cationic current sensitive to TRPM4 channel blockers. Here, we tested whether TRPM4 contributes to subthreshold oscillations in mouse LC and SCN. By RNAscope <I>in situ</I> hybridization, <I>Trpm4</I> transcripts were detected in both cell groups. In whole-cell recordings from acute slice preparations, prominent voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations were revealed in LC and SCN after blocking action potentials. These oscillations were inhibited by two chemically-distinct blockers of TRPM4, 9-phenanthrol (9-pt) and 4-chloro-2-[[2-(2-chlorophenoxy)acetyl]amino]benzoic acid (CBA). Under whole-cell voltage clamp, inward currents evoked by oscillation voltage waveforms were inhibited in LC by blocking L-type calcium channels and TRPM4. These data implicate TRPM4 in the large subthreshold membrane potential oscillations that underlie tonic action potential discharge in LC and SCN, providing a voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent cationic current to augment the depolarizing inward Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents previously associated with this distinctive electroresponsive property.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Modeling Physiological Sources of Heading Bias from Optic Flow</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human heading perception from optic flow is accurate for directions close to the straight-ahead and systematic biases emerge in the periphery (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B10">Cuturi and Macneilage, 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Sun et al., 2020</cross-ref>). In pursuit of the underlying neural mechanisms, primate brain dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) area has been a focus because of its causal link with heading perception (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Gu et al., 2012</cross-ref>). Computational models generally explain heading sensitivity in individual MSTd neurons as a feedforward integration of motion signals from medial temporal (MT) area that resemble full-field optic flow patterns consistent with the preferred heading direction (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Britten, 2008</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Mineault et al., 2012</cross-ref>). In the present simulation study, we quantified within the structure of this feedforward model how physiological properties of MT and MSTd shape heading signals. We found that known physiological tuning characteristics generally supported the accuracy of heading estimation, but not always. A weak-to-moderate overrepresentation of peripheral headings in MSTd garnered the highest accuracy and precision out of the models that we tested. The model also performed well when noise corrupted high proportions of the optic flow vectors. Such a peripheral MSTd model performed well when units possessed a range of receptive field (RF) sizes and were strongly direction tuned. Physiological biases in MT direction tuning toward the radial direction also supported heading estimation, but the tendency for MT preferred speed and RF size to scale with eccentricity did not. Our findings help elucidate the extent to which different physiological tuning properties influence the accuracy and precision of neural heading signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of environmental factors on hematology profile of Gambusia affinis caught at Brantas River watershed, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Contamination of freshwater ecosystems has become a major issue as it threatens public water sources as well as aquatic life. It is important to predict changes in organism health, given a known number of environmental factors and pollutant concentrations, in order to better manage contaminants through biomarker analysis. This study aims to examine the ecosystem health of the Brantas River based on its environmental condition and the hematology profile of Gambusia affinis fish present in the river. This species was chosen because of its wide distribution along the Brantas River, and because it is very tolerant, adaptable, highly abundant, and easy to catch. Methods: The study area included 10 sampling sites along the Brantas River watershed. In total, six water quality parameters were observed (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia concentration, and phenol concentration) and hematology measurements consisted of erythrocyte, leucocyte, and micronuclei analyses. Results: The results showed that the upstream area of Brantas River, located in Batu, was the least polluted region, while Mojokerto was the most polluted. The erythrocyte level of Gambusia affinis caught in most sampling sites was quite low. Furthermore, research revealed that the status of Gambusia affinis' hematological profile was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with water quality parameters, particularly DO, BOD, ammonia, and phenol. Conclusions: It can be concluded from these results that the hematological profile of the fish is poor due to high levels of organic waste and harmful substances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">WBC-based segmentation and classification on microscopic images: a minor improvement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction White blood cells (WBCs) are immunity cells which fight against viruses and bacteria in the human body. Microscope images of captured WBCs for processing and analysis are important to interpret the body condition. At present, there is no robust automated method to segment and classify WBCs images with high accuracy. This paper aims to improve on WBCs image segmentation and classification method. Methods A triple thresholding method was proposed to segment the WBCs; meanwhile, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classification model that adopts transfer learning technique was proposed to detect and classify WBCs as a healthy or a malignant. The input dataset of this research work is the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB). The process first converts the captured microscope images into HSV format for obtaining the H component. Otsu thresholding is applied to segment the WBC area. A 13 × 13 kernel with two iterations was used to apply morphological opening on image to ameliorate output results. Collected cell masks were used to detect the contour of each cell on the original image. To classify WBCs into a healthy or a malignant category, characteristics and conditions of WBCs are to be examined. A transfer learning technique and pre-trained InceptionV3 model were employed to extract the features from the images for classification. Results The proposed WBCs segmentation method yields 90.45% accuracy, 83.81% of the structural similarity index, 76.25% of the dice similarity coefficient, and is computationally efficient. The accuracy of fine-tuned classifier model for training, validation and test sets are 93.27%, 92.31% and 96.15% respectively. The obtained results are high in accuracy and precision are over 96% and with lower loss value. Discussion Triple thresholding outperforms K-means clustering in segmenting smaller dataset. Pre-trained InceptionV3 model and transfer learning improve the flexibility and ability of classifier.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence and characterisation of herpes simplex virus from human immunodeficiency virus in samples collected from two provinces in South Africa: a retrospective study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions: There is a significant positive association between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in the study population. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">2-DOF robot modelling by SimMechanics and PD-FL integrated controller for position control and trajectory tracking [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Due to the high demand of robots to perform several industrial tasks, such as welding, machining, pick and place, position control in robotics has attracted high attention recently. Controllers’ improvement is also continuous specifically in terms of design simplicity and performance accuracy. This research plans to obtain the SimMechanics model of a two-degree of freedom (DOF) robot and to propose an integrated controller of a proportional–derivative (PD) controller and a fuzzy logic (FL) controller. Methodology The SimMechanics model of the 2-DOF robot is obtained using MATLAB SimMechanics toolbox from a CAD assembly design of the 2-DOF robot. Then, the proposed PD-FL integrated controller is designed and simulated in MATLAB Simulink. The PD controller is widely used for its simplicity, but it doesn’t have a satisfactory performance in difficult tasks. Furthermore, the FL controller is also easy for design and implementation even by non-experts in control theory, but it has the disadvantage of long computational time for multi-input systems due to the increased fuzzy rules. Results The FL controller is integrated with the PD controller for enhanced performance of the 2-DOF robot. The PD-FL integrated controller is developed and tested to control the 2-DOF robot for point-to-point position control and also tip trajectory tracking (TTT) such as triangular TTT and rhombic TTT. Conclusion The PD-FL integrated controller demonstrates enhanced performance compared to the conventional PD controller in both point-to-point position control and TTT. Furthermore, the PD-FL integrated controller has the advantage of less fuzzy rules which helps to overcome the computational time issue of the FL controller.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does COVID-19 infection change the need for future surgical interventions? An exploratory analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is unknown whether recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection leads to an increased need for common surgical procedures. Our objective was to conduct an exploratory analysis of surgical procedures performed after a documented COVID-19 infection.  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We identified individuals with a positive COVID-19 test between February 1 2020 and May 31 2020, and matched them 1:2 with individuals who had a negative COVID-19 test during the same period. We used physician billing codes to identify the ten most frequent surgical procedures in the COVID-19 cohort. An at-risk period 30 days after the first positive COVID-19 swab (or matched index date in the control group) until November 30 2020 was used. Cox proportional hazard models (adjusted for important baseline differences) are reported with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals.   Results: After exclusions and matching, we had 19,143 people in the COVID-19 cohort, and 38,286 people in the control cohort. The top ten surgical procedures were hand/wrist fracture fixation, cesarean-section, ureteral stent placement, cholecystectomy, treatment of an upper tract urinary stone, hysterectomy, femur fracture repair, hip replacement, transurethral prostatectomy, and appendectomy. There was a significantly reduced hazard of requiring upper tract renal stone surgery (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.87) or ureteral stent placement (aHR 0.54, 95%CI 0.36-0.82), or undergoing a cholecystectomy (aHR 0.43, 95%CI 0.26-0.71) among those with a prior positive COVID-19 test.   Conclusions: After a COVID-19 infection there is not an increased risk of needing several common surgical procedures. There appears to be a reduced risk of renal stone disease treatment and ureteral stent placement, and a reduced risk of cholecystectomy, however understanding the reasons for this will require further study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-population coupling of neural activity based on Gaussian process current source densities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalie Klein, Joshua H. Siegle, Tobias Teichert, Robert E. Kass</p>

Because local field potentials (LFPs) arise from multiple sources in different spatial locations, they do not easily reveal coordinated activity across neural populations on a trial-to-trial basis. As we show here, however, once disparate source signals are decoupled, their trial-to-trial fluctuations become more accessible, and cross-population correlations become more apparent. To decouple sources we introduce a general framework for estimation of current source densities (CSDs). In this framework, the set of LFPs result from noise being added to the transform of the CSD by a biophysical forward model, while the CSD is considered to be the sum of a zero-mean, stationary, spatiotemporal Gaussian process, having fast and slow components, and a mean function, which is the sum of multiple time-varying functions distributed across space, each varying across trials. We derived biophysical forward models relevant to the data we analyzed. In simulation studies this approach improved identification of source signals compared to existing CSD estimation methods. Using data recorded from primate auditory cortex, we analyzed trial-to-trial fluctuations in both steady-state and task-evoked signals. We found cortical layer-specific phase coupling between two probes and showed that the same analysis applied directly to LFPs did not recover these patterns. We also found task-evoked CSDs to be correlated across probes, at specific cortical depths. Using data from Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we again found evidence for depth-specific phase coupling of primary visual cortex and lateromedial area based on the CSDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MGEnrichment: A web application for microglia gene list enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Jao, Annie Vogel Ciernia</p>

Gene expression analysis is becoming increasingly utilized in neuro-immunology research, and there is a growing need for non-programming scientists to be able to analyze their own genomic data. MGEnrichment is a web application developed both to disseminate to the community our curated database of microglia-relevant gene lists, and to allow non-programming scientists to easily conduct statistical enrichment analysis on their gene expression data. Users can upload their own gene IDs to assess the relevance of their expression data against gene lists from other studies. We include example datasets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from human postmortem brain samples from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and matched controls. We demonstrate how MGEnrichment can be used to expand the interpretations of these DEG lists in terms of regulation of microglial gene expression and provide novel insights into how ASD DEGs may be implicated specifically in microglial development, microbiome responses and relationships to other neuropsychiatric disorders. This tool will be particularly useful for those working in microglia, autism spectrum disorders, and neuro-immune activation research. MGEnrichment is available at https://ciernialab.shinyapps.io/MGEnrichmentApp/ and further online documentation and datasets can be found at https://github.com/ciernialab/MGEnrichmentApp. The app is released under the GNU GPLv3 open source license.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Upregulation of DNA repair genes and cell extrusion underpin the remarkable radiation resistance of Trichoplax adhaerens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Angelo Fortunato, Alexis Fleming, Athena Aktipis, Carlo C. Maley</p>

<i>Trichoplax adhaerens</i> is the simplest multicellular animal with tissue differentiation and somatic cell turnover. Like all other multicellular organisms, it should be vulnerable to cancer, yet there have been no reports of cancer in <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> or any other placozoan. We investigated the cancer resistance of <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i>, discovering that they are able to tolerate high levels of radiation damage (218.6 Gy). To investigate how <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> survive levels of radiation that are lethal to other animals, we examined gene expression after the X-ray exposure, finding overexpression of genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis including the <i>MDM2</i> gene. We also discovered that <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> extrudes clusters of inviable cells after X-ray exposure. <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> is a valuable model organism for studying the molecular, genetic, and tissue-level mechanisms underlying cancer suppression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pattern changes of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi women preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Perfusion Imaging Predicts Favorable Outcomes after Basilar Artery Thrombectomy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging identifies anterior circulation stroke patients who respond favorably to endovascular thrombectomy (ET), but its role in basilar occlusion (BAO) is unknown. We hypothesized that BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion (Time-to-maximum [Tmax] delay &gt;10 seconds) would have a favorable response to ET compared to patients with more extensive regions involved.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of BAO patients with perfusion imaging prior to ET. We pre-specified a Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS; 0-6 points), which quantified severe hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt;10s) in cerebellum (1 point/hemisphere), pons (2 points), midbrain and/or thalamus (2 points). Patients were dichotomized into favorable (CAPS≤3) and unfavorable (CAPS&gt;3) groups. The primary outcome was a favorable functional outcome 90-days after ET (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>103 patients were included. CAPS≤3 patients (87%) had a lower median NIHSS (12.5 [IQR 7-22]) compared to CAPS&gt;3 patients (13%) (23 [IQR 19-36]; p=0.01). Reperfusion was achieved in 84% of all patients with no difference between CAPS groups (p=0.42). 64% of reperfused CAPS≤3 patients had a favorable outcome compared to 8% of non-reperfused CAPS≤3 patients (OR=21.0 [95% CI 2.6-170]; p&lt;0.001). No CAPS&gt;3 patients had a favorable outcome, regardless of reperfusion. In a multivariable regression analysis, CAPS≤3 was a robust independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjustment for reperfusion, age, and pre-ET NIHSS (OR 39.25 [95% CI 1.34-&gt;999)]; p=0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion had a favorable response to reperfusion following ET. However, patients with more extensive regions of hypoperfusion in critical brain regions did not benefit from endovascular reperfusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online harassment in Japan: Dissecting the targeting of a female journalist [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Harassment on the Internet, particularly on social media such as Twitter, has reached a level where it can, without exaggeration, be characterised as a real-world societal problem in Japan. However, studies on this phenomenon in the Japanese language environment, especially adopting a victim-centric perspective, are rare. In this paper, we incorporated the concept of online harassment and reviewed existing studies about online harassment from Japan and abroad. We then conducted a detailed case analysis of the “flaming” of a female journalist and those who targeted her on Twitter. Based on our analysis, we observed that there were three layers of users who targeted the journalist: influencers, users who responded to the instigation by influencers, and trolls. Each harassed the journalist, but in a different manner. Given Japan’s particular difficulty of imposing domestic regulations on social media companies that are mostly from abroad, we propose and describe possible measures that individuals and their employers should consider taking.

                Accumulating evidence supports the prevalence of experience-dependent oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination in learning and memory. However, the mechanisms remain unknown. In this issue of Neuron, Osso et al., (2021) report that stress causes the secretion of dynorphin by unmyelinated axons, which induces OPC differentiation and myelination of neighboring axons.

                Stojkovska et al. found that Parkinson’s patient neurons accumulate α-synuclein and are deficient at recognizing misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inducing pathogenic aggregation of immature lysosomal hydrolases. This phenotype is rescued by combined enhancement of ER proteostasis and protein trafficking, leading to lysosomal activation and reduction of α-synuclein.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">mTOR-dependent translation drives tumor infiltrating CD8+ effector and CD4+ Treg cells expansion</a></h4>

              
                We performed a systematic analysis of the translation rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the microenvironment inputs affecting it, both in humans and in mice. Measurement of puromycin incorporation, a proxy of protein synthesis, revealed an increase of translating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in tumors, compared to normal tissues. High translation levels are associated with phospho-S6 labeling downstream of mTORC1 activation, whereas low levels correlate with hypoxic areas, in agreement with data showing that T cell receptor stimulation and hypoxia act as translation stimulators and inhibitors, respectively. Additional analyses revealed the specific phenotype of translating TILs. CD8<sup>+</sup> translating cells have enriched expression of IFN-γ and CD-39, and reduced SLAMF6, pointing to a cytotoxic phenotype. CD4<sup>+</sup> translating cells are mostly regulatory T cells (Tregs) with enriched levels of CTLA-4 and Ki67, suggesting an expanding immunosuppressive phenotype. In conclusion, the majority of translationally active TILs is represented by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> and suppressive CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, implying that other subsets may be largely composed by inactive bystanders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of protein synthesis and memory by GluN3A-NMDA receptors through inhibition of GIT1/mTORC1 assembly</a></h4>

              
                De novo protein synthesis is required for synapse modifications underlying stable memory encoding. Yet neurons are highly compartmentalized cells and how protein synthesis can be regulated at the synapse level is unknown. Here, we characterize neuronal signaling complexes formed by the postsynaptic scaffold GIT1, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, and Raptor that couple synaptic stimuli to mTOR-dependent protein synthesis; and identify NMDA receptors containing GluN3A subunits as key negative regulators of GIT1 binding to mTOR. Disruption of GIT1/mTOR complexes by enhancing GluN3A expression or silencing GIT1 inhibits synaptic mTOR activation and restricts the mTOR-dependent translation of specific activity-regulated mRNAs. Conversely, GluN3A removal enables complex formation, potentiates mTOR-dependent protein synthesis, and facilitates the consolidation of associative and spatial memories in mice. The memory enhancement becomes evident with light or spaced training, can be achieved by selectively deleting GluN3A from excitatory neurons during adulthood, and does not compromise other aspects of cognition such as memory flexibility or extinction. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into synaptic translational control and reveal a potentially selective target for cognitive enhancement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dysfunctions of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus induce hypersomnia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Hypersomnolence disorder (HD) is characterized by excessive sleep, which is a common sequela following stroke, infection or tumorigenesis. HD is traditionally thought to be associated with lesions of wake-promoting nuclei. However, lesions of a single wake-promoting nucleus, or even two simultaneously, did not exert serious HD. Therefore, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for HD remain unknown. Here, we observed that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) exhibited higher c-fos expression during the active period (23:00) than during the inactive period (11:00) in mice. Therefore, we speculated that the PVH, in which most neurons are glutamatergic, may represent one of the key arousal-controlling centers. By using vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vglut2<sup>Cre</sup>) mice together with fiber photometry, multichannel electrophysiological recordings, and genetic approaches, we found that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons were most active during wakefulness. Chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced wakefulness for 9 h, and photostimulation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup>→parabrachial complex/ventral lateral septum circuits immediately drove transitions from sleep to wakefulness. Moreover, lesioning or chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons dramatically decreased wakefulness. These results indicate that the PVH is critical for arousal promotion and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unconventional conservation reveals structure-function relationships in the synaptonemal complex</a></h4>

              
                Functional requirements constrain protein evolution, commonly manifesting in a conserved amino acid sequence. Here, we extend this idea to secondary structural features by tracking their conservation in essential meiotic proteins with highly diverged sequences. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a ~100-nm-wide ladder-like meiotic structure present in all eukaryotic clades, where it aligns parental chromosomes and regulates exchanges between them. Despite the conserved ultrastructure and functions of the SC, SC proteins are highly divergent within <i>Caenorhabditis</i>. However, SC proteins have highly conserved length and coiled-coil domain structure. We found the same unconventional conservation signature in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals, and used it to identify a novel SC protein in <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i>, Ppa-SYP-1. Our work suggests that coiled-coils play wide-ranging roles in the structure and function of the SC, and more broadly, that expanding sequence analysis beyond measures of per-site similarity can enhance our understanding of protein evolution and function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human B cell lineages associated with germinal centers following influenza vaccination are measurably evolving</a></h4>

              
                The poor efficacy of seasonal influenza virus vaccines is often attributed to pre-existing immunity interfering with the persistence and maturation of vaccine-induced B cell responses. We previously showed that a subset of vaccine-induced B cell lineages are recruited into germinal centers (GCs) following vaccination, suggesting that affinity maturation of these lineages against vaccine antigens can occur. However, it remains to be determined whether seasonal influenza vaccination stimulates additional evolution of vaccine-specific lineages, and previous work has found no significant increase in somatic hypermutation (SHM) among influenza-binding lineages sampled from the blood following seasonal vaccination in humans. Here, we investigate this issue using a phylogenetic test of measurable immunoglobulin sequence evolution. We first validate this test through simulations and survey measurable evolution across multiple conditions. We find significant heterogeneity in measurable B cell evolution across conditions, with enrichment in primary response conditions such as HIV infection and early childhood development. We then show that measurable evolution following influenza vaccination is highly compartmentalized: while lineages in the blood are rarely measurably evolving following influenza vaccination, lineages containing GC B cells are frequently measurably evolving. Many of these lineages appear to derive from memory B cells. We conclude from these findings that seasonal influenza virus vaccination can stimulate additional evolution of responding B cell lineages, and imply that the poor efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccination is not due to a complete inhibition of vaccine-specific B cell evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stronger net selection on males across animals</a></h4>

              
                Sexual selection is considered the major driver for the evolution of sex differences. However, the eco-evolutionary dynamics of sexual selection and their role for a population’s adaptive potential to respond to environmental change have only recently been explored. Theory predicts that sexual selection promotes adaptation at a low demographic cost only if sexual selection is aligned with natural selection and if net selection is stronger on males compared to females. We used a comparative approach to show that net selection is indeed stronger in males and provide preliminary support that this sex bias is associated with sexual selection. Given that both sexes share the vast majority of their genes, our findings corroborate the notion that the genome is often confronted with a more stressful environment when expressed in males. Collectively, our study supports one of the long-standing key assumptions required for sexual selection to bolster adaptation, and sexual selection may therefore enable some species to track environmental change more efficiently.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arginine-vasopressin mediates counter-regulatory glucagon release and is diminished in type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a major barrier to the treatment of type-1 diabetes (T1D). Accordingly, it is important that we understand the mechanisms regulating the circulating levels of glucagon - the body's principal blood glucose-elevating hormone which is secreted from alpha-cells of the pancreatic islets. Varying glucose over the range of concentrations that occur physiologically between the fed and fuel-deprived states (from 8 to 4 mM) has no significant effect on glucagon secretion in the perfused mouse pancreas or in isolated mouse islets (<i>in vitro</i>) and yet associates with dramatic changes in plasma glucagon <i>in vivo</i>. The identity of the systemic factor(s) that stimulates glucagon secretion remains unknown. Here, we show that arginine-vasopressin (AVP), secreted from the posterior pituitary, stimulates glucagon secretion. Glucagon-secreting alpha-cells express high levels of the vasopressin 1b receptor gene (<i>Avpr1b</i>). Activation of AVP neurons <i>in vivo</i> increased circulating copeptin (the C-terminal segment of the AVP precursor peptide, a stable surrogate marker of AVP) and increased blood glucose; effects blocked by pharmacological antagonism of either the glucagon receptor or vasopressin 1b receptor. AVP also mediates the stimulatory effects of hypoglycemia produced by exogenous insulin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose on glucagon secretion. We show that the A1/C1 neurons of the medulla oblongata drive AVP neuron activation in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Exogenous injection of AVP <i>in vivo </i>increased cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in alpha-cells (implanted into the anterior chamber of the eye) and glucagon release. Hypoglycemia also increases circulating levels of AVP in humans and this hormone stimulates glucagon secretion from isolated human islets. In patients with T1D, hypoglycemia failed to increase both plasma copeptin and glucagon levels. These findings suggest that AVP is a physiological systemic regulator of glucagon secretion and that this mechanism becomes impaired in T1D.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urgency forces stimulus-driven action by overcoming cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Intelligent behavior requires to act directed by goals despite competing action tendencies triggered by stimuli in the environment. For eye movements, it has recently been discovered that this ability is briefly reduced in urgent situations (Salinas et al., 2019). In a time-window before an urgent response, participants could not help but look at a suddenly appearing visual stimulus, even though their goal was to look away from it. Urgency seemed to provoke a new visual–oculomotor phenomenon: A period in which saccadic eye movements are dominated by external stimuli, and uncontrollable by current goals. This period was assumed to arise from brain mechanisms controlling eye movements and spatial attention, such as those of the frontal eye field. Here, we show that the phenomenon is more general than previously thought. We found that also in well-investigated manual tasks, urgency made goal-conflicting stimulus features dominate behavioral responses. This dominance of behavior followed established trial-to-trial signatures of cognitive control mechanisms that replicate across a variety of tasks. Thus together, these findings reveal that urgency temporarily forces stimulus-driven action by overcoming cognitive control in general, not only at brain mechanisms controlling eye movements.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modulation of pulsatile GnRH dynamics across the ovarian cycle via changes in the network excitability and basal activity of the arcuate kisspeptin network</a></h4>

              
                Pulsatile GnRH release is essential for normal reproductive function. Kisspeptin secreting neurons found in the arcuate nucleus, known as KNDy neurons for co-expressing neurokinin B, and dynorphin, drive pulsatile GnRH release. Furthermore, gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulsatile dynamics across the ovarian cycle by altering KNDy neurons' signalling properties. However, the precise mechanism of regulation remains mostly unknown. To better understand these mechanisms we start by perturbing the KNDy system at different stages of the estrous cycle using optogenetics. We find that optogenetic stimulation of KNDy neurons stimulates pulsatile GnRH/LH secretion in estrous mice but inhibits it in diestrous mice. These in-vivo results in combination with mathematical modelling suggest that the transition between estrus and diestrus is underpinned by well-orchestrated changes in neuropeptide signalling and in the excitability of the KNDy population controlled via glutamate signalling. Guided by model predictions, we show that blocking glutamate signalling in diestrous animals inhibits LH pulses, and that optic stimulation of the KNDy population mitigates this inhibition. In estrous mice, disruption of glutamate signalling inhibits pulses generated via sustained low-frequency optic stimulation of the KNDy population, supporting the idea that the level of network excitability is critical for pulse generation. Our results reconcile previous puzzling findings regarding the estradiol-dependent effect that several neuromodulators have on the GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Therefore, we anticipate our model to be a cornerstone for a more quantitative understanding of the pathways via which gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Finally, our results could inform useful repurposing of drugs targeting the glutamate system in reproductive therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergent, functionally independent signaling by mu and delta opioid receptors in hippocampal parvalbumin interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Functional interactions between G protein-coupled receptors are poised to enhance neuronal sensitivity to neuromodulators and therapeutic drugs. Mu and Delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) can interact when overexpressed in the same cells, but whether co-expression of endogenous MORs and DORs in neurons leads to functional interactions is unclear. Here, in mice, we show that both MORs and DORs inhibit parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PV-BCs) in hippocampal CA1 through partially occlusive signaling pathways that terminate on somato-dendritic potassium channels and presynaptic calcium channels. Using photoactivatable opioid neuropeptides, we find that DORs dominate the response to enkephalin in terms of both ligand-sensitivity and kinetics, which may be due to relatively low expression levels of MOR. Opioid-activated potassium channels do not show heterologous desensitization, indicating that MORs and DORs signal independently. In a direct test for heteromeric functional interactions, the DOR antagonist TIPP-Psi does not alter the kinetics or potency of either the potassium channel or synaptic responses to photorelease of the MOR agonist DAMGO. Thus, aside from largely redundant and convergent signaling, MORs and DORs do not functionally interact in PV-BCs in a way that impacts somato-dendritic potassium currents or synaptic transmission. These findings imply that crosstalk between MORs and DORs, either in the form of physical interactions or synergistic intracellular signaling, is not a preordained outcome of co-expression in neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upregulation of CREB1 and FOXO1 transcription factor pathways in Neuregulin-1 mediated neuroprotection following ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is growth factor that has been investigated for its neuroprotective properties following ischemic stroke. While NRG-1 has shown significant promise in preventing neuronal damage following stroke, the mechanisms behind its neuroprotective effects are unclear. The goal of this research was to investigate the effects of NRG-1 treatment on ischemia-induced gene expression profiles following a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Rats were sacrificed twelve hours following MCAO and either vehicle or NRG-1 treatment. RNA extracted from the peri-infarct cortex of the brain was hybridized to an Affymetrix Rat Genome 2.0st Microarray Gene Chip. Data were analyzed using the Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) 4.0 software and the STRING Protein-Protein Interaction Networks database.  Our results showed that NRG?1 delivery increased the regulation of pro-survival genes. Most notably, NRG-1 treatment upregulated the CREB1 and FOXO1 transcription factor pathways which are involved in increasing anti-inflammatory and cell proliferation responses and decreasing apoptosis and oxidative stress responses, respectively. Luminex multiplex transcription factor assays demonstrated that the activities of CREB1 and FOXO1 were increased by NRG-1 treatment with MCAO. These findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in NRG-1 mediated neuroprotection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneous stereo-EEG and high-density scalp EEG recordings to study the effects of intracerebral stimulation parameters</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) recorded by stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) are a valuable clinical tool to investigate brain reactivity and effective connectivity. However, these invasive recordings are spatially sparse since they depend on clinical needs. This sparsity hampers systematic comparisons across-subjects, the detection of the whole-brain spatiotemporal properties of CCEPs, as well as their relationships with classic sensory evoked potentials. Objective: To demonstrate that CCEPs recorded by high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) are sensitive to changes in stimulation parameters and compensate for the limitations typical of invasive recordings. Methods: SEEG and hd-EEG activities were simultaneously recorded during SPES in drug-resistant epileptic patients (N=36). Changes in stimulation parameters encompassed physical (pulse intensity and width), geometrical (angle and position with respect to white/grey matter) and topological (stimulated cortical area) properties. Differences were assessed by measuring the overall responses and the amplitude of N1 and N2 components of the CCEPs, and by their spectral profiles. Results: While invasive and non-invasive CCEPs were generally correlated, differences in pulse duration, angle and stimulated cortical area were better captured by hd-EEG. Further, hd-EEG responses to SPES reproduced basic features of responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation and showed a much larger amplitude as compared to typical sensory evoked potentials. Conclusions: The present results show that macroscale hd-EEG recordings are exquisitely sensitive to variations in SPES parameters, including local changes in physical and geometrical stimulus properties, while providing valuable information about whole-brain dynamics. Moreover, the common reference space across subjects represented by hd-EEG may facilitate the construction of a perturbational atlas of effective connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auricular transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation acutely modulates brain connectivity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain electrical stimulation techniques take advantage of the intrinsic plasticity of the nervous system, opening a wide range of therapeutic applications. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved adjuvant for drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. Its non-invasive form, auricular transcutaneous VNS (atVNS), is under investigation for applications, including cognitive improvement. Objective: We aimed to study the effects of atVNS on brain connectivity, under conditions that improved memory persistence in CD-1 male mice. Methods: Acute atVNS in the cymba conchae of the left ear was performed using a standard stimulation protocol under light isoflurane anesthesia, immediately or 3 h after the training/familiarization phase of the novel object-recognition memory test (NORT). Another cohort of mice was used for bilateral c-Fos analysis after atVNS administration. Spearman correlation of c-Fos density between each pair of the thirty brain regions analyzed allowed obtaining the network of significant functional connections in stimulated and non-stimulated control brains. Results: NORT performance was enhanced when atVNS was delivered just after, but not 3 h after, the familiarization phase of the task. No alterations in c-Fos density were associated to electrostimulation, but a significant effect of atVNS was observed on c-Fos- based functional connectivity. atVNS induced a clear reorganization of the network, increasing the inter-hemisphere connections and the connectivity of locus coeruleus. Conclusion: Our results provide new insights in the effects of atVNS on memory performance and brain connectivity extending our knowledge of the biological mechanisms of bioelectronics in medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic auditory stimulation rescues cognitive flexibility in mutant mice with impaired gamma synchrony</a></h4>

              
                Neural synchronization at gamma (~40 Hz) frequencies is believed to contribute to brain function and be deficient in disorders including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Gamma-frequency sensory stimulation has been proposed as a non-invasive treatment for deficient gamma synchrony and associated cognitive deficits, and has been shown to be effective in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. However, both the mechanism and applicability of this approach remain unclear. Here we tested this approach using mutant (Dlx5/6+/-) mice which have deficits in gamma synchrony and the ability to learn to shift between rules which use different types of cues to indicate reward locations. 40 Hz auditory stimulation rescues rule shifting in Dlx5/6+/- mice. However, this improvement does not outlast the period of stimulation, and is not associated with normalized gamma synchrony, measured using genetically encoded voltage indicators. These results show how gamma-frequency sensory stimulation may improve behavior without fully restoring normal circuit function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Home literacy environment mediates the relationship between socioeconomic status and white matter structure in infants</a></h4>

              
                The home literacy environment (HLE) in infancy has been associated with subsequent pre-literacy skill development and HLE at pre-school age has been shown to correlate with white matter organization in tracts that subserve pre-reading and reading skills. Furthermore, childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked with both HLE and white matter organization. It is also important to understand whether the relationships between environmental factors such as HLE and SES and white matter organization can be detected as early as infancy, as this period is characterized by rapid brain development that may make white matter pathways particularly susceptible to these early experiences. Here, we hypothesized (1) an association between HLE and white matter organization in pre-reading and reading-related tracts in infants, and (2) that this association mediates a link between SES and white matter organization. To test these hypotheses, infants (mean age: 9.2 +/- 2.5 months, N = 18) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging MRI during natural sleep. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and left arcuate fasciculus using the automated fiber-tract quantification method. HLE was measured with the Reading subscale of the StimQ and SES was measured with years of maternal education. Self-reported maternal reading ability was also quantified and applied to all statistical models to control for confounding genetic effects. The Reading subscale of the StimQ positively related to FA in left SLF and mediated the association between maternal education and FA in the left SLF. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of considering HLE from the start of life and may inform novel prevention and intervention strategies targeted at low-SES families to support developing infants during a period of heightened brain plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Channel opening duration in adult muscle nAChRs determined by activated external ACh binding site</a></h4>

              
                We recorded currents through the cell membrane at single nAChR molecules, held at ACh or Epibatidine (Ebd) concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 M. The measured current amplitudes had an absolutely fixed value of 15 pA. This was valid for different agonists at all concentrations. Binding an agonist at one or both sites in the ring of subunits allowed to open the channel, the site that initiated the opening determined the duration of the final opening of the channel. In addition, the current flow was continuously interrupted by < 3 s shut times. The resolution of our records was optimized to reach 5 s, but was insufficient to resolve an unknown proportion of shorter shut times. Therefore, measured durations of openings are overestimated, and cited in brackets: {tau}o1 (3 s) elicited by agonist-binding at the {delta}-site, {tau}o2 and {tau}o3 (40 and 183 s) by binding at the {epsilon}-site, and {tau}o4 (752 s) by binding at the {delta}- and {epsilon}-site. Mono-liganded nAChRs trigger short bursts of 0.6 ms duration. Bi-liganded nAChRs generate long bursts that at low agonist concentrations last 12 ms. Above 10 M ACh, long bursts are shortened, with 100 M ACh, to 5 ms, and further at higher concentrations. While ACh was the main agonist, Ebd bound more effectively than ACh to the {epsilon}-site.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not Quite All in Our Head: Intervention is a Better Predictor of tDCS Mind-Wandering Effects than Subjective Beliefs About Experimental Results</a></h4>

              
                Background: Establishing adequate blinding for non-invasive brain stimulation research is a topic of extensive debate, especially regarding the efficacy of sham control methods for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) studies. Fassi and Cohen Kadosh [1] assessed the influence of subjective participant belief regarding stimulation type (active or sham) and dosage on behaviour using data from Filmer et al. [2] who applied five stimulation protocols (anodal 1.0mA, cathodal 1.0mA, cathodal 1.5mA, cathodal 2.0mA and sham) to assess the neural substrates of mind wandering. Fassi and Cohen Kadosh [1] concluded that subjective belief drove the pattern of results observed by Filmer et al. [2]. Objective: Fassi and Cohen Kadosh [1] did not assess the key contrast between conditions in Filmer et al. (2019), 2mA vs sham, rather they examined all stimulation conditions. Here, we consider the relationship between objective and subjective intervention in this key contrast. Methods: We replicated the analysis and findings of both Filmer et al. [2] and Fassi and Cohen Kadosh [1] before assessing 2mA vs. sham via Bayesian ANOVA on subjective belief regarding stimulation type and dosage. Results: Our results support objective intervention as the strongest predictor of stimulation effects on mind-wandering when 2mA vs sham was examined, over and above that of subjective intervention. Conclusions: The conclusions made by Filmer et al. [2] are confirmed. However, it is important to control for and understand the possible effects of subjective beliefs in sham controlled studies. Best practice to prevent these issues remains the inclusion of active control conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotional ego- and altercentric biases in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder: Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence</a></h4>

              
                Self-other distinction is a crucial aspect of social cognition, as it allows us to differentiate our own mental and emotional states from those of others. Research suggests that this ability might be impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but convincing evidence of self-other distinction deficits in the emotional domain is lacking. Here we aimed at evaluating emotional self-other distinction abilities in adults with and without ASD, in two behavioral pilot studies and one fMRI study. By using a newly developed virtual ball-tossing game that induced simultaneous positive and negative emotional states in each participant and another person, we were able to measure emotional egocentric and altercentric biases (namely the tendency to ascribe self-/other-related emotions to others/ourselves, respectively). Despite no behavioral differences, individuals with ASD showed decreased activation 1) in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) during active overcoming of the emotional egocentric bias vs. passive game viewing, and 2) in the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) during ego- vs. altercentric biases, compared to neurotypical participants. These results suggest a different recruitment of these two regions in ASD when dealing with conflicting emotional states of oneself and another person. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of considering different control conditions when interpreting the involvement of rTPJ and rSMG during self-other distinction processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consonance perception in congenital amusia: behavioral and brain responses to harmonicity and beating cues</a></h4>

              
                Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in the perception and production of music, including the perception of consonance and dissonance, or the judgment of certain combinations of pitches as more pleasant than others. Two perceptual cues for dissonance are inharmonicity (the lack of a common fundamental frequency between components) and beating (amplitude fluctuations produced by close, interacting frequency components). In the presence of inharmonicities or beats, amusics have previously been reported to be insensitive to inharmonicity, but to exhibit normal sensitivity to beats. In the present study, we measured adaptive discrimination thresholds in amusic participants and found elevated thresholds for both cues. We recorded EEG and measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) in evoked potentials to consonance and dissonance deviants in an oddball paradigm. The amplitude of the MMN response was similar overall for amusics and controls, but while control participants showed a stronger MMN to harmonicity cues than to beating cues, amusic participants showed a stronger MMN to beating cues than to harmonicity cues. These findings suggest that initial encoding of consonance cues may be intact in amusia despite impaired behavioral performance, but that the relative weight of non-spectral cues may be increased for amusic individuals.

                The neural architecture of the cerebellum is thought to be specialized for performing supervised learning: specific error-related climbing fiber inputs are used to teach sensorimotor associations to small ensembles of Purkinje cells located in functionally distinct modules that operate independently of each other in a purely feedforward manner. Here, we test whether the basic operation of the cerebellum complies with this basic architecture in mice that learned a simple sensorimotor association during eyeblink conditioning. By recording Purkinje cells in different modules and testing whether their responses rely on recurrent circuits, our results reveal three operational principles about the functional organization of the cerebellum that stand in stark contrast to the conventional view: (1) Antagonistic organization, (2) Recurrent network dynamics, and (3) Intermodular communication. We propose that the neural architecture of the cerebellum implements these three operational principles to achieve optimal performance and solve a number of problems in motor control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal information loading into working memory in prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Working memory involves the short-term maintenance of information and is critical in many tasks. The neural circuit mechanisms underlying this information maintenance are thought to rely on persistent activities resulting from attractor dynamics. However, how information is loaded into working memory for subsequent maintenance remains poorly understood. A pervasive assumption is that information loading requires inputs that are similar to the persistent activities expressed during maintenance. Here, we show through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations that optimal inputs are instead largely orthogonal to persistent activities and naturally generate the rich transient dynamics that are characteristic of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during working memory. By analysing recordings from monkeys performing a memory-guided saccade task, and using a novel, theoretically principled metric, we show that PFC exhibits the hallmarks of optimal information loading. Our theory unifies previous, seemingly conflicting theories of memory maintenance based on attractor or purely sequential dynamics, and reveals a normative principle underlying the widely observed phenomenon of dynamic coding in PFC. These results suggest that optimal information loading may be a key component of attractor dynamics characterising various cognitive functions and cortical areas, including long-term memory and navigation in the hippocampus, and decision making in the PFC.

	<p>Slowed information processing speed (IPS) is the hallmark and first cognitive domain to be altered in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Insufficient serum vitamin D was previously associated with disease development, relapses, and progression, but little is reported on cognition. However, vitamin D and cognitive impairment (CI) in other neurodegenerative diseases have already been linked. We explored the possible correlation between vitamin D and IPS at diagnosis and early disability at last follow-up in 81 MS patients. At diagnosis, we collected vitamin D levels and performed a Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Raw scores were adjusted for age, gender, and educational level. Early disability was evaluated with MS severity score (MSSS) and age-related MSSS (ARMSS). A total of 71 patients (86.58%) showed hypovitaminosis D (19.71 ± 8.76 ng/mL) and 18 patients (21.95%) had CI. Patients with CI showed severe hypovitaminosis D (p = 0.004). No patients with sufficient vitamin D levels had CI. We found a positive correlation between vitamin D levels at diagnosis and (1) SDMT raw and z-score that persisted after correction for sunlight exposure and MRI baseline characteristics, and (2) EDSS, MSSS, and ARMSS after a mean 2 year follow-up. Low vitamin D levels may affect both cognition and early disability in newly diagnosed MS patients.</p>

	<p>The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep have been widely documented, but longitudinal evaluations during different phases of the “COVID-19 era” are needed to disentangle the specific consequences of the r145estrictive measures on sleep variables. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate effect of the lockdown’s end on sleep and sleep-related dimensions in an Italian sample, also considering the stress and depressive symptoms. We used an online survey to longitudinally collect data on sociodemographic, environmental, clinical, sleep, and sleep-related variables in two time points: during and immediately after the lockdown. The final sample included 102 participants. The large prevalence of poor sleep quality, clinically relevant pre-sleep arousal, and depressive symptoms, as well as poor sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal score observed during the lockdown, remained stable after its end. On the other hand, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe event-related stress and intrusive symptom scores exhibited a drastic reduction after the end of home confinement. Both bedtime and rise time were anticipated after the lockdown, while sleep quality exhibited only a trend of post-lockdown sleep disturbance reduction. Our findings point to a reduced stress level (specific for the intrusive symptomatology) after the end of the lockdown and persistence of sleep problems, suggesting two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (a) the strict restrictive measures are not the main cause of sleep problems during the pandemic and (b) home confinement induces long-lasting effects on sleep observable after its end, and a longer period of time might be needed to observe an improvement.</p>

	<p>Neuropsychological, behavioral, and neurophysiological evidence indicates that the coding of space as near and far depends on the involvement of different neuronal circuits. These circuits are recruited on the basis of functional parameters, not of metrical ones, reflecting a general distinction of human behavior, which alternatively attributes to the individual the role of agent or observer. Although much research in cognitive psychology was devoted to demonstrating that language and concepts are rooted in the sensorimotor system, no study has investigated the presence of implicit associations between different adverbs of place (far vs. near) and actions with different functional characteristics. Using a series of Implicit Association Test (IAT) experiments, we tested this possibility for both actions performed in physical space (grasp vs. look at) and those performed when using digital technology (content&amp;amp;nbsp;generation vs. content&amp;amp;nbsp;consumption). For both the physical and digital environments, the results showed an association between the adverb near and actions related to the role of agent, and between the adverb far and actions related to the role of observer. Present findings are the first experimental evidence of an implicit association between different adverbs of place and different actions and of the fact that adverbs of place also apply to the digital environment.</p>

	<p>Anecdotal reports indicate that women dislike their partner’s body odor (BO) during the breakdown of a relationship; however, whether disliking a partner’s BO is associated with intentions to break up has not been empirically tested. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate, for the first time, whether disliking one’s partner’s BOs is associated with experiencing lower commitment to a romantic relationship. Eighty participants (48 partnered, 32 single and previously partnered) completed self-report questionnaires about their current or previous romantic relationship and the amount of exposure to—and hedonic ratings of—their current or former partner’s BOs. Olfactory function was also tested, and participants smelled and rated various pieces of clothing imbued with a stranger’s BO. The results demonstrated that for participants who had experienced a breakup, historically higher levels of relationship commitment were associated with higher hedonic ratings of a previous partner’s BOs, regardless of the type of BOs. For participants currently in a relationship, lower relationship commitment was associated with higher breakup intentions in response to smelling their partner’s BOs. These preliminary results contribute evidence for the positive association between exposure to a partner’s BOs and favorable hedonic appraisals of BOs; however, further research needs to be conducted in this area to investigate nuances. Lower levels of exposure to one’s partner’s BOs may be more indicative of relationship commitment than exposure to hedonically unpleasant BOs of one’s partner. The findings are discussed with reference to their implications for interventions in relationship breakdown.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of strengthening exercise plus activities of daily living instructions in reducing pain in patients with lumbar disc herniation: a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of chronic low back pain (CLBP) with sciatica. The exercise intervention was found effective in improving CLBP, although a paucity of research evaluated the effectiveness of exercise intervention to alleviate CLBP due to LDH. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of back and hip strengthening exercises and activities of daily living instructions (ADLIs) to improve CLBP with sciatica due to LDH. Method: This assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on 70 patients with CLBP with sciatica due to LDH. The patients were randomly allocated either in the intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). Patients in IG received both back and hip strengthening exercises five days a week for six weeks. Patients in CG received pharmacological therapy for three weeks, followed by hot moist compression for another three weeks. Patients of both groups followed the ADLIs at the time of the intervention and at least three months after the intervention. Back pain intensity and perceived pain due to sciatica were measured by the Visual Analogue Scale and range of hip flexion during the Straight Leg Raising Test, respectively, at three weeks and six weeks of intervention, and three months after the intervention. Results: Back pain and sciatica improved significantly (p < 0.05) in both groups at the end of the intervention and follow-up, while the IG showed significantly better improvements (p < 0.05) at the end of the intervention. However, only ADLIs were not adequate to sustain the improvements after the intervention. Conclusion: The combination of back and hip strengthening exercises and ADLIs improves CLBP with sciatica due to LDH. Nevertheless, it is required to instruct patients to follow ADLIs and perform strengthening exercises regularly to maintain the improvements. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05021718.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq of TMA46 (DFRP1) and GIR2 (DFRP2) knockout yeast strains [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, stalled and collided ribosomes are recognized by several conserved multicomponent systems, which either block protein synthesis in situ and resolve the collision locally, or trigger a general stress response. Yeast ribosome-binding GTPases RBG1 (DRG1 in mammals) and RBG2 (DRG2) form two distinct heterodimers with TMA46 (DFRP1) and GIR2 (DFRP2), respectively, both involved in mRNA translation. Accumulated evidence suggests that the dimers play partially redundant roles in elongation processivity and resolution of ribosome stalling and collision events, as well as in the regulation of GCN1-mediated signaling involved in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). They also genetically interact with SLH1 (ASCC3) helicase, a key component of RQC trigger (RQT) complex disassembling collided ribosomes. Here, we present RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) data from S. cerevisiae strains with individual deletions of the TMA46 and GIR2 genes. Raw RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq data as well as gene-level read counts are available in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under GEO accession GSE185458 and GSE185286.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticocortical connections link visual cortical areas in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. We studied the postnatal refinement of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret area 17 during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. We aimed to determine (1) whether callosal projections from multiple visual cortical areas to area 17 refine with a similar rate and (2) whether the refinement of callosal projections parallels that of intrahemispheric cortical circuits. We injected the bidirectional tracer CTb into area 17, and mapped the areal and laminar distribution of labeled cells in visual areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Like intrahemispheric projections, callosal inputs to area 17 before eye opening are dominated by Suprasylvian area Ssy (with lesser and comparable input from areas 17, 18, 19, and 21), but within 2 weeks of eye opening are jointly dominated by area 18 and Ssy inputs; however, there are fewer labeled cells in the contralateral hemisphere. Unlike intrahemispheric projections, there is no laminar reorganization of callosal inputs; in all visual areas and at all ages studied, the greatest proportion of callosal projections arises from the infragranular layers. Also, unlike intrahemispheric projections, the peak density of callosal cells in each area projecting to area 17 declines more modestly. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to area 17.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of cogon grass root ethanol extract on fatty acid binding protein 4 and oxidative stress markers in a sepsis mouse model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sepsis causes several immunological and metabolic alterations that induce oxidative stress. The modulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been shown to worsen this condition. Extract of cogon grass root (ECGR) contains flavonoids and isoeugenol compounds that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the effects of ECGR on FABP4 and oxidative stress–related factors in a sepsis mouse model. Methods: Twenty-nine male mice (Mus musculus) of the Deutsche Denken Yoken strain were divided into four groups: group 1, control; group 2, mice treated with 10 μL/kg body weight (BW) lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and groups 3 and 4, mice pre-treated with 90 and 115 mg/kg BW, respectively, and then treated with 10 μL/kg BW LPS for 14 d. Blood, liver, spleen, and cardiac tissue samples were collected and subjected to histological and complete blood examinations. Antioxidant activity, FABP4 levels, and immune system-associated biomarker levels were also measured. Results: Significant increases in platelet levels (p = 0.03), cardiomyocyte counts (p =0.004), and hepatocyte counts (p = 0.0004) were observed in group 4 compared with those in group 2. Conversely, compared with those in group 2, there were significant decreases in TNF-α expression in group 3 (p = 0.004), white pulp length and width in group 4 (p = 0.001), FABP4 levels in groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.012, respectively), lymphocyte counts in group 4 (p = 0.009), monocyte counts (p = 0.000) and polymorphonuclear cell counts in the livers (p = 0.000) and hearts (p = 0.000) of groups 3 and 4. Gpx3 activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Cogon grass root may aid in the development of herbal medicines and specific treatments for sepsis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pedagogy of Success: Perception in undergraduate and postgraduate students at a Peruvian university [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study's objective was to compare whether there are differences in the perception of undergraduate and postgraduate students about the pedagogy of success.   Methods: This is non-experimental research with a comparative descriptive design, and a hypothetical deductive method was used. The perception of success pedagogy questionnaire was applied as a data collection technique with a sample of 50 university students with 23 items based on three dimensions: opportunity to learn (nine items), feedback (eight items), and consideration of the person (six items), with the following qualitative value scale, always = high, sometimes = middle, and never = low; the scale of quantitative value was from two to zero. To find the instrument's validity, it was subjected to expert judgment, calculating the content validity ratio for each item and considering the criteria of clarity and relevance. The instrument's reliability was determined using Cronbach's alpha, which found a high consistency between the items. For the questionnaire application, Google Forms was used to obtain fast, timely, and reliable answers. The data were processed through the SPSS V. 25.   Results: The pedagogical support of the postgraduate teacher is more effective than that of the undergraduate. The undergraduate teacher stands out for listening and being more empathic. Didactics is crucial for students to develop their cognitive and human potential. Academic success is related to the teacher's pedagogical skills and the student's motivation. In addition, teachers and students can develop cognitive skills through effective communication and socialization. Finally, the affective dimension allows students to achieve personal and professional goals.  Conclusions: There are significant differences in the perception of the pedagogy of success among undergraduate and postgraduate university students; therefore, the application of this methodology is more promoted towards postgraduate students than to their undergraduate peers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A nowcasting framework for correcting for reporting delays in malaria surveillance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tigist F. Menkir, Horace Cox, Canelle Poirier, Melanie Saul, Sharon Jones-Weekes, Collette Clementson, Pablo M. de Salazar, Mauricio Santillana, Caroline O. Buckee</p>

Time lags in reporting to national surveillance systems represent a major barrier for the control of infectious diseases, preventing timely decision making and resource allocation. This issue is particularly acute for infectious diseases like malaria, which often impact rural and remote communities the hardest. In Guyana, a country located in South America, poor connectivity among remote malaria-endemic regions hampers surveillance efforts, making reporting delays a key challenge for elimination. Here, we analyze 13 years of malaria surveillance data, identifying key correlates of time lags between clinical cases occurring and being added to the central data system. We develop nowcasting methods that use historical patterns of reporting delays to estimate occurred-but-not-reported monthly malaria cases. To assess their performance, we implemented them retrospectively, using only information that would have been available at the time of estimation, and found that they substantially enhanced the estimates of malaria cases. Specifically, we found that the best performing models achieved up to two-fold improvements in accuracy (or error reduction) over known cases in selected regions. Our approach provides a simple, generalizable tool to improve malaria surveillance in endemic countries and is currently being implemented to help guide existing resource allocation and elimination efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multivariable association discovery in population-scale meta-omics studies</a></h4>

It is challenging to associate features such as human health outcomes, diet, environmental conditions, or other metadata to microbial community measurements, due in part to their quantitative properties. Microbiome multi-omics are typically noisy, sparse (zero-inflated), high-dimensional, extremely non-normal, and often in the form of count or compositional measurements. Here we introduce an optimized combination of novel and established methodology to assess multivariable association of microbial community features with complex metadata in population-scale observational studies. Our approach, MaAsLin 2 (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models), uses generalized linear and mixed models to accommodate a wide variety of modern epidemiological studies, including cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as a variety of data types (e.g., counts and relative abundances) with or without covariates and repeated measurements. To construct this method, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of a broad range of scenarios under which straightforward identification of meta-omics associations can be challenging. These simulation studies reveal that MaAsLin 2’s linear model preserves statistical power in the presence of repeated measures and multiple covariates, while accounting for the nuances of meta-omics features and controlling false discovery. We also applied MaAsLin 2 to a microbial multi-omics dataset from the Integrative Human Microbiome (HMP2) project which, in addition to reproducing established results, revealed a unique, integrated landscape of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) across multiple time points and omics profiles.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Systematic exploration of Escherichia coli phage–host interactions with the BASEL phage collection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Enea Maffei, Aisylu Shaidullina, Marco Burkolter, Yannik Heyer, Fabienne Estermann, Valentin Druelle, Patrick Sauer, Luc Willi, Sarah Michaelis, Hubert Hilbi, David S. Thaler, Alexander Harms</p>

Bacteriophages, the viruses infecting bacteria, hold great potential for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and other applications due to their unparalleled diversity and recent breakthroughs in their genetic engineering. However, fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying phage–host interactions is mostly confined to a few traditional model systems and did not keep pace with the recent massive expansion of the field. The true potential of molecular biology encoded by these viruses has therefore remained largely untapped, and phages for therapy or other applications are often still selected empirically. We therefore sought to promote a systematic exploration of phage–host interactions by composing a well-assorted library of 68 newly isolated phages infecting the model organism <i>Escherichia coli</i> that we share with the community as the BASEL (BActeriophage SElection for your Laboratory) collection. This collection is largely representative of natural <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> phage diversity and was intensively characterized phenotypically and genomically alongside 10 well-studied traditional model phages. We experimentally determined essential host receptors of all phages, quantified their sensitivity to 11 defense systems across different layers of bacterial immunity, and matched these results to the phages’ host range across a panel of pathogenic enterobacterial strains. Clear patterns in the distribution of phage phenotypes and genomic features highlighted systematic differences in the potency of different immunity systems and suggested the molecular basis of receptor specificity in several phage groups. Our results also indicate strong trade-offs between fitness traits like broad host recognition and resistance to bacterial immunity that might drive the divergent adaptation of different phage groups to specific ecological niches. We envision that the BASEL collection will inspire future work exploring the biology of bacteriophages and their hosts by facilitating the discovery of underlying molecular mechanisms as the basis for an effective translation into biotechnology or therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The economics of managing evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Troy Day, David A. Kennedy, Andrew F. Read, David McAdams</p>

Humans are altering biological systems at unprecedented rates, and these alterations often have longer-term evolutionary impacts. Most obvious is the spread of resistance to pesticides and antibiotics. There are a wide variety of management strategies available to slow this evolution, and there are many reasons for using them. In this paper, we focus on the economic aspects of evolution management and ask: When is it economically beneficial for an individual decision-maker to invest in evolution management? We derive a simple dimensionless inequality showing that it is cost-effective to manage evolution when the percentage increase in the effective life span of the biological resource that management generates is larger than the percentage increase in annual profit that could be obtained by not managing evolution. We show how this inequality can be used to determine optimal investment choices for single decision-makers, to determine Nash equilibrium investment choices for multiple interacting decision-makers, and to examine how these equilibrium choices respond to regulatory interventions aimed at stimulating investment in evolution management. Our results are illustrated with examples involving <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) crops and antibiotic use in fish farming.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cardiac Investigations in Sudden Unexpected Death in DEPDC5‐Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Germline loss-of-function mutations in <i>DEPDC5</i>, and in its binding partners (<i>NPRL2/3</i>) of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) repressor GATOR1 complex, cause focal epilepsies and increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Here, we asked whether <i>DEPDC5</i> haploinsufficiency predisposes to primary cardiac defects that could contribute to SUDEP and therefore impact the clinical management of patients at high risk of SUDEP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical cardiac investigations were performed in 16 patients with pathogenic variants in <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>NPRL2</i>, or <i>NPRL3</i>. Two novel <i>Depdc5</i> mouse strains, a human HA-tagged <i>Depdc5</i> strain and a <i>Depdc5</i> heterozygous knockout with a neuron-specific deletion of the second allele (<i>Depdc5</i>
<sup>c/−</sup>), were generated to investigate the role of <i>Depdc5</i> in SUDEP and cardiac activity during seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Holter, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic (ECG) examinations provided no evidence for altered clinical cardiac function in the patient cohort, of whom 3 <i>DEPDC5</i> patients succumbed to SUDEP and 6 had a family history of SUDEP. There was no cardiac injury at autopsy in a postmortem <i>DEPDC5</i> SUDEP case. The HA-tagged <i>Depdc5</i> mouse revealed expression of <i>Depdc5</i> in the brain, heart, and lungs. Simultaneous electroencephalographic–ECG records on <i>Depdc5</i>
<sup>c/−</sup> mice showed that spontaneous epileptic seizures resulting in a SUDEP-like event are not preceded by cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mouse and human data show neither structural nor functional cardiac damage that might underlie a primary contribution to SUDEP in the spectrum of <i>DEPDC5</i>-related epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">target: an R package to predict combined function of transcription factors [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Similarly, they use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the transcription factor overexpression or knockdown on its targets. Therefore, the integration of the binding and expression data can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. Here, we implemented the binding and expression target analysis (BETA) in an R/Bioconductor package. This algorithm ranks the targets based on the distances of their assigned peaks from the transcription factor ChIP experiment and the signed statistics from gene expression profiling with transcription factor perturbation. We further extend BETA to integrate two sets of data from two transcription factors to predict their targets and their combined functions. In this article, we briefly describe the workings of the algorithm and provide a workflow with a real dataset for using it. The gene targets and the aggregate functions of transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells were identified. Using the same datasets, we identified the shared targets of the two transcription factors, which were found to be, on average, more cooperatively regulated.

                Inactivation experiments in auditory cortex (AC) produce widely varying results that complicate interpretations regarding the precise role of AC in auditory perception and ensuing behaviour. The advent of optogenetic methods in neuroscience offers previously unachievable insight into the mechanisms transforming brain activity into behaviour. With a view to aiding the design and interpretation of future studies in and outside AC, here we discuss the methodological challenges faced in manipulating neural activity.

In contrast, the selectivity filter of the Nematostella vectensis TRPM2 (nvTRPM2) does not form a gate.

                Shen et al. report N-terminal acetylation in yeast is involved in autophagy regulation. The N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat3 plays an essential role in autophagy by modifying actin cytoskeleton constituent Act1 and dynamin-like GTPase Vps1, which regulate the upstream transport of Atg9 vesicles and downstream fusion of autophagosomes with vacuoles.
