              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental evidence that uniformly white sclera enhances the visibility of eye-gaze direction in humans and chimpanzees</a></h4>

              
                Hallmark social activities of humans, such as cooperation and cultural learning, involve eye-gaze signaling through joint attentional interaction and ostensive communication. The gaze-signaling and related cooperative-eye hypotheses posit that humans evolved unique external eye morphologies, including uniformly white sclera (the whites of the eye), to enhance the visibility of eye-gaze for conspecifics. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This study tested the ability of human and chimpanzee participants to discriminate the eye-gaze directions of human and chimpanzee images in computerized tasks. We varied the level of brightness and size in the stimulus images to examine the robustness of the eye-gaze directional signal against simulated shading and distancing. We found that both humans and chimpanzees discriminated eye-gaze directions of humans better than those of chimpanzees, particularly in visually challenging conditions. Also, participants of both species discriminated the eye-gaze directions of chimpanzees better when the contrast polarity of the chimpanzee eye was reversed compared to when it was normal; namely, when the chimpanzee eye has human-like white sclera and a darker iris. Uniform whiteness in the sclera thus facilitates the visibility of eye-gaze direction even across species. Our findings thus support but also critically update the central premises of the gaze-signaling hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temperature evolution following joint loading promotes chondrogenesis by synergistic cues via calcium signaling</a></h4>

              
                During loading of viscoelastic tissues, part of the mechanical energy is transformed into heat that can locally increase the tissue temperature, a phenomenon known as self-heating. In the framework of mechanobiology, it has been accepted that cells react and adapt to mechanical stimuli. However, the cellular effect of temperature increase as a by-product of loading has been widely neglected. In this work, we focused on cartilage self-heating to present a ‘thermo-mechanobiological’ paradigm, and demonstrate how the coupling of a biomimetic temperature evolution and mechanical loading could influence cell behavior. We thereby developed a customized in vitro system allowing to recapitulate pertinent in vivo physical cues and determined the cells chondrogenic response to thermal and/or mechanical stimuli. Cellular mechanisms of action and potential signaling pathways of thermo-mechanotransduction process were also investigated. We found that co-existence of thermo-mechanical cues had a superior effect on chondrogenic gene expression compared to either signal alone. Specifically, the expression of Sox9 was significantly upregulated by application of the physiological thermo-mechanical stimulus. Multimodal transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels were identified as key mediators of thermo-mechanotransduction process, which becomes ineffective without external calcium sources. We also observed that the isolated temperature evolution, as a by-product of loading, is a contributing factor to the cell response and this could be considered as important as the conventional mechanical loading. Providing an optimal thermo-mechanical environment by synergy of heat and loading portrays new opportunity for development of novel treatments for cartilage regeneration and can furthermore signal key elements for emerging cell-based therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Placental uptake and metabolism of 25(OH)vitamin D determine its activity within the fetoplacental unit</a></h4>

              
                Pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes. Using physiological human placental perfusion and villous explants, we investigate the role of the placenta in regulating the relationships between maternal 25(OH)D and fetal physiology. We demonstrate active placental uptake of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> by endocytosis, placental metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>], with subsequent release of these metabolites into both the maternal and fetal circulations. Active placental transport of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> demonstrate that fetal supply is dependent on placental function rather than simply the availability of maternal 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> exposure induces rapid effects on the placental transcriptome and proteome. These map to multiple pathways central to placental function and thereby fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. Our data suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps dictate the transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment. This is the first quantitative study demonstrating vitamin D transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself. These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta and will inform future interventions using vitamin D to support fetal development and maternal adaptations to pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Confined migration promotes cancer metastasis through resistance to anoikis and increased invasiveness</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical stress is known to fuel several hallmarks of cancer, ranging from genome instability to uncontrolled proliferation or invasion. Cancer cells are constantly challenged by mechanical stresses not only in the primary tumour but also during metastasis. However, this latter has seldom been studied with regards to mechanobiology, in particular resistance to anoikis, a cell death programme triggered by loss of cell adhesion. Here, we show in vitro that migrating breast cancer cells develop resistance to anoikis following their passage through microporous membranes mimicking confined migration (CM), a mechanical constriction that cancer cells encounter during metastasis. This CM-induced resistance was mediated by Inhibitory of Apoptosis Proteins, and sensitivity to anoikis could be restored after their inhibition using second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics. Anoikis-resistant mechanically stressed cancer cells displayed enhanced cell motility and evasion from natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance, as well as a marked advantage to form lung metastatic lesions in mice. Our findings reveal that CM increases the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.

	<p>The morphology of the hippocampus and amygdala can be significantly affected by a long-term hypoxia-induced inflammatory response. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has a significant effect on the neuroplasticity of the hippocampus and amygdala by countering inflammation. However, the role of CRF is still largely unclear at high altitudes. Here, we investigated brain limbic volumes in participants who had experienced long-term hypoxia exposure in Tibet (3680 m), utilizing high-resolution structural images to allow the segmentation of the hippocampus and amygdala into their constituent substructures. We recruited a total of 48 participants (48 males; aged = 20.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.03 years) to undergo a structural 3T MRI, and the levels of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were measured using a cardiorespiratory function test. Inflammatory biomarkers were also collected. The participants were divided into two groups according to the levels of median VO2max, and the analysis showed that the morphological indexes of subfields of the hippocampus and amygdala of the lower CRF group were decreased when compared with the higher CRF group. Furthermore, the multiple linear regression analysis showed that there was a higher association with inflammatory factors in the lower CRF group than that in the higher CRF group. This study suggested a significant association of CRF with hippocampus and amygdala volume, which may be related to hypoxic stress in high-altitude environments. A better CRF reduced physiological stress and a decrease in the inflammatory response was observed, which may be related to the increased oxygen transport capacity of the body.</p>

                Integrative drug safety research in translational health informatics has rapidly evolved and included data that are drawn in from many resources, combining diverse data that are either reused from (curated) repositories, or newly generated at source. Each resource is mandated by different sets of metadata rules that are imposed on the incoming data. Combination of the data cannot be readily achieved without interference of data stewardship and the top-down policy guidelines that supervise and inform the process for data combination to aid meaningful interpretation and analysis of such data. The eTRANSAFE Consortium's effort to drive integrative drug safety research at a large scale hereby present the lessons learnt and the proposal of solution at the guidelines in practice at this Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project. Recommendations in these guidelines were compiled from feedback received from key stakeholders in regulatory agencies, EFPIA companies, and academic partners. The research reproducibility guidelines presented in this study lay the foundation for a comprehensive data sharing and knowledge management plans accounting for research data management in the drug safety space - FAIR data sharing guidelines, and the model verification guidelines as generic deliverables that best practices that can be reused by other scientific community members at large. FAIR data sharing is a dynamic landscape that rapidly evolves with fast-paced technology advancements. The research reproducibility in drug safety guidelines introduced in this study provides a reusable framework that can be adopted by other research communities that aim to integrate public and private data in biomedical research space.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of Remote Ischemic Conditioning on Hand Engagement in individuals with Spinal cord Injury (RICHES): protocol for a pilot crossover study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                ​​​​​​Background: Most spinal cord injuries (SCI) are not full transections, indicating that residual nerve circuits are retained. Rehabilitation interventions have been shown to beneficially reorganize motor pathways in the brain, corticospinal tract, and at the spinal level. However, rehabilitation training require a large number of repetitions, and intervention effects may be absent or show transient retention. Therefore, the need remains for an effective approach to synergistically improve the amount and duration of neuroplasticity in combination with other interventions. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) demonstrates several potential advantages as a candidate for such an approach. Therefore, we propose a protocol to investigate RIC coupled with physical training to promote neuroplasticity in hand muscles. Methods: This will be a prospective randomized-order crossover trial to be performed in eight able-bodied participants and eight participants with chronic cervical SCI. Patients will participate in two experimental sessions consisting of either active or sham RIC preceding a bout of pinch movement exercise. Serial evaluations will be conducted at baseline, after RIC, immediately after pinch exercise, and follow up 15-minutes later. The primary outcome is the change in corticospinal excitability (primarily measured by the motor evoked potential of abductor pollicis brevis muscle). Secondary outcomes will include maximal volitional pinch force, and inflammatory biomarkers. To ensure safety, we will monitor tolerability and hemodynamic responses during RIC. Discussion: This protocol will be the first to test RIC in people with cervical SCI and to investigate whether RIC alters corticospinal excitability. By sharing the details of our protocol, we hope other interested researchers will seek to investigate similar approaches – depending on overlap with the current study and mutual sharing of participant-level data, this could increase the sample size, power, and generalizability of the analysis and results.

                Background: Autonomous vehicles are important in smart transportation. Although exciting progress has been made, it remains challenging to design a safety mechanism for autonomous vehicles despite uncertainties and obstacles that occur dynamically on the road. Collision detection and avoidance are indispensable for a reliable decision-making module in autonomous driving. Methods: This study presents a robust approach for forward collision warning using vision data for autonomous vehicles on Malaysian public roads. The proposed architecture combines environment perception and lane localization to define a safe driving region for the ego vehicle. If potential risks are detected in the safe driving region, a warning will be triggered. The early warning is important to help avoid rear-end collision. Besides, an adaptive lane localization method that considers geometrical structure of the road is presented to deal with different road types. Results: Precision scores of mean average precision (mAP) 0.5, mAP 0.95 and recall of 0.14, 0.06979 and 0.6356 were found in this study. Conclusions: Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different lighting and environmental conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Studies on the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial activity, and toxicity of Catha edulis (Vahl.) Endl., in Sprague Dawley rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Mbeere South community of Embu County consume leaves of Catha edulis for its stimulant and euphoretic actions. Other indigenous uses of the plant are undocumented. Information on the pharmacology and safety of this plant is also scanty. This study aimed to document the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial properties, and toxicity of C. edulis leaves collected from the Mbeere South community in Kenya. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected from 35 informants using semi-structured questionnaires. Leaf extracts of C. edulis were prepared using acetone, water, and methanol. The antimicrobial properties of these extracts were evaluated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The toxicity of the aqueous extract was determined using hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg doses over 28 days. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: All informants were male, married, >50 years old, with >10 years of experience. The sources, local names, preparation, storage conditions, indications, frequency of use, dosage, and side effects of C. edulis were documented. All extracts were ineffective against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. They had limited efficacy against B. cereus and S. aureus. Significant differences were observed in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats at the tested doses. Low, intermediate, and high doses of the aqueous extract of C. edulis produced local congestion of the cardiac and hepatic vessels. Localized interstitial connective tissue proliferation, multifocal kidney interstitial hemorrhage, and localized tubular epithelium necrosis were also observed in female rats. Conclusions: The ethnobotanical uses of C. edulis among the Mbeere South community were documented for the first time. Limited antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity at high doses limit the use of leaves of C. edulis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance of the T cell senescence markers in predicting the active disease of systemic lupus erythematosus [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Accelerated immunosenescence has been observed in several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). T cell senescence plays an essential role in the destruction of organs in SLE patients. This study aimed to identify the ability of immunosenescence markers to predict SLE disease activity. Methods: Overall, 61 SLE patients and 60 healthy subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score assessed disease activity. Senescence surface markers of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry (CD4/CD8 ratio, CD28null, CD57, CD45 isoforms [CD45RA and CD45RO], and KLRG1). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum cytokines (IFNγ and IL-2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology. Complement and anti-dsDNA levels were also evaluated as the comparator for predicting active disease in SLE. Logistic regression models were used to identify the independent predictive factors for active SLE status. Performance of the senescence markers in predicting active disease in SLE was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the area under curve (AUC). Results: SLE patients with active disease had significantly higher CD8+CD28null, CD8+CD57+, CD8+CD45RA+, CD8+CD45RO+, and CD8+KLRG1+ percentages with lower CD4/CD8 ratio than healthy subjects and SLE patients with inactive disease. The highest AUC and sensitivity were seen in CD8+CD28null (AUC 0.801 [0.662-0.940], sensitivity 91.9%, cut off >6.85%) with comparable results to serum complement and anti-dsDNA in predicting active disease. Multivariate analysis showed that CD4/CD8 ratio, CD8+CD28null, and C3 had significantly increased OR for active SLE. Combination models of CD4/CD8 ratio, CD8+CD28null, and C3 yielded the best results for predicting the active SLE (AUC 0.923 [0.848-0.997], sensitivity 81.2%, specificity 84.0%, LR+ 5.08 and LR- 0.22). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that combining immunosenescence markers, including CD4/CD8 ratio and CD8+CD28null with C3 levels could increase the odds of predicting active disease in SLE.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The IC-50-time evolution is a new model to improve drug responses consistency of large scale studies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Large-scale studies combining hundreds of cancer cell lines and many cancer drugs, with their promises and challenges, represent a new development in the in vitro screening of cancer drugs. However, drugs sensitivity results of the same cancer cell lines exposed to the same cancer drugs generated different IC50s by these studies as noticed by Haibe-Kains B et al (1). These inconsistencies are due to many factors: the experimental conditions and the use of the Four Parameter Logistic (4PL) regression model to analyze drugs sensitivity results. A new model based on the Levasseur LM et al model, the Gompertzian growth model of in vitro monolayer culture, and the IC-50 time course evolution is more appropriate to improve the accuracy of these large scale studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In-air Hand Gesture Signature Recognition: An iHGS Database Acquisition Protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background With the advances in current technology, hand gesture recognition has gained considerable attention. It has been extended to recognize more distinctive movements, such as a signature, in human-computer interaction (HCI) which enables the computer to identify a person in a non-contact acquisition environment. This application is known as in-air hand gesture signature recognition. To our knowledge, there are no publicly accessible databases and no detailed descriptions of the acquisitional protocol in this domain. Methods This paper aims to demonstrate the procedure for collecting the in-air hand gesture signature’s database. This database is disseminated as a reference database in the relevant field for evaluation purposes. The database is constructed from the signatures of 100 volunteer participants, who contributed their signatures in two different sessions. Each session provided 10 genuine samples enrolled using a Microsoft Kinect sensor camera to generate a genuine dataset. In addition, a forgery dataset was also collected by imitating the genuine samples. For evaluation, each sample was preprocessed with hand localization and predictive hand segmentation algorithms to extract the hand region. Then, several vector-based features were extracted. Results In this work, classification performance analysis and system robustness analysis were carried out. In the classification analysis, a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to classify the samples and 97.43% accuracy was achieved; while the system robustness analysis demonstrated low error rates of 2.41% and 5.07% in random forgery and skilled forgery attacks, respectively. Conclusions These findings indicate that hand gesture signature is not only feasible for human classification, but its properties are also robust against forgery attacks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of Preclinical Task Based Learning program in Medical Education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The conventional curriculum in preclinical medical education has a need for early clinical exposure programs that help in correlation of basic science data with clinical skills. This is helpful to develop clinical reasoning skills, problem-solving abilities, team work, communication skills and overall attitudes and behaviour relevant for a healthcare provider. Preclinical task based learning (TskBL) is an active learning strategy in which the focus for the first year medical student is a real task done by a doctor. In this strategy the student-doctors undergo a standardized patient encounter and discuss the learning issues related to the task in the first year of medical school. The current study is focussed on the student perception of the effectiveness of task based learning module.The TskBL was conducted among first year medical students for nine topics that are commonly encountered in the clinics. After TskBL was planned and implemented the evaluation of the modules was done using focus group discussions. The students highlighted the importance of standardized patients in the TskBL strategy in providing early clinical exposure in preclinical medical education. They reported its usefulness gaining essential knowledge, skills and attitudes for medical learning. They reported positive outcomes of module design and processes and activities in TskBL. Based on the negative aspects of the modules, future improvement was suggested in improving the usefulness of standardized patient encounter. This study showed the novice learners’ outlook of the potency of TskBL for several other topics of clinical relevance to provide early clinical exposure in medical schools.

Emerging clinical evidence suggests that thrombosis in the microvasculature of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays an essential role in dictating the disease progression. Because of the infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, patients’ fresh blood samples are limited to access for <i>in vitro</i> experimental investigations. Herein, we employ a novel multiscale and multiphysics computational framework to perform predictive modeling of the pathological thrombus formation in the microvasculature using data from patients with COVID-19. This framework seamlessly integrates the key components in the process of blood clotting, including hemodynamics, transport of coagulation factors and coagulation kinetics, blood cell mechanics and adhesive dynamics, and thus allows us to quantify the contributions of many prothrombotic factors reported in the literature, such as stasis, the derangement in blood coagulation factor levels and activities, inflammatory responses of endothelial cells and leukocytes to the microthrombus formation in COVID-19. Our simulation results show that among the coagulation factors considered, antithrombin and factor V play more prominent roles in promoting thrombosis. Our simulations also suggest that recruitment of WBCs to the endothelial cells exacerbates thrombogenesis and contributes to the blockage of the blood flow. Additionally, we show that the recent identification of flowing blood cell clusters could be a result of detachment of WBCs from thrombogenic sites, which may serve as a nidus for new clot formation. These findings point to potential targets that should be further evaluated, and prioritized in the anti-thrombotic treatment of patients with COVID-19. Altogether, our computational framework provides a powerful tool for quantitative understanding of the mechanism of pathological thrombus formation and offers insights into new therapeutic approaches for treating COVID-19 associated thrombosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructing benchmark test sets for biological sequence analysis using independent set algorithms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samantha Petti, Sean R. Eddy</p>

Biological sequence families contain many sequences that are very similar to each other because they are related by evolution, so the strategy for splitting data into separate training and test sets is a nontrivial choice in benchmarking sequence analysis methods. A random split is insufficient because it will yield test sequences that are closely related or even identical to training sequences. Adapting ideas from independent set graph algorithms, we describe two new methods for splitting sequence data into dissimilar training and test sets. These algorithms input a sequence family and produce a split in which each test sequence is less than <i>p</i>% identical to any individual training sequence. These algorithms successfully split more families than a previous approach, enabling construction of more diverse benchmark datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-based identification of conditionally-essential genes from transposon-insertion sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vishal Sarsani, Berent Aldikacti, Shai He, Rilee Zeinert, Peter Chien, Patrick Flaherty</p>

The understanding of bacterial gene function has been greatly enhanced by recent advancements in the deep sequencing of microbial genomes. Transposon insertion sequencing methods combines next-generation sequencing techniques with transposon mutagenesis for the exploration of the essentiality of genes under different environmental conditions. We propose a model-based method that uses regularized negative binomial regression to estimate the change in transposon insertions attributable to gene-environment changes in this genetic interaction study without transformations or uniform normalization. An empirical Bayes model for estimating the local false discovery rate combines unique and total count information to test for genes that show a statistically significant change in transposon counts. When applied to RB-TnSeq (randomized barcode transposon sequencing) and Tn-seq (transposon sequencing) libraries made in strains of <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> using both total and unique count data the model was able to identify a set of conditionally beneficial or conditionally detrimental genes for each target condition that shed light on their functions and roles during various stress conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multimeric structure enables the acceleration of KaiB-KaiC complex formation induced by ADP/ATP exchange inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shin-ichi Koda, Shinji Saito</p>

Circadian clocks tick a rhythm with a nearly 24-hour period in a variety of organisms. In the clock proteins of cyanobacteria, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, known as a minimum circadian clock, the slow KaiB-KaiC complex formation is essential in determining the clock period. This complex formation, occurring when the C1 domain of KaiC hexamer binds ADP molecules produced by the ATPase activity of C1, is considered to be promoted by accumulating ADP molecules in C1 through inhibiting the ADP/ATP exchange (ADP release) rather than activating the ATP hydrolysis (ADP production). Significantly, this ADP/ATP exchange inhibition accelerates the complex formation together with its promotion, implying a potential role in the period robustness under environmental perturbations. However, the molecular mechanism of this simultaneous promotion and acceleration remains elusive because inhibition of a backward process generally slows down the whole process. In this article, to investigate the mechanism, we build several reaction models of the complex formation with the pre-binding process concerning the ATPase activity. In these models, six KaiB monomers cooperatively and rapidly bind to C1 when C1 binds ADP molecules more than a given threshold while stabilizing the binding-competent conformation of C1. Through comparison among the models proposed here, we then extract three requirements for the simultaneous promotion and acceleration: the stabilization of the binding-competent C1 by KaiB binding, slow ADP/ATP exchange in the binding-competent C1, and relatively fast ADP/ATP exchange occurring in the binding-incompetent C1 in the presence of KaiB. The last two requirements oblige KaiC to form a multimer. Moreover, as a natural consequence, the present models can also explain why the binding of KaiB to C1 reduces the ATPase activity of C1.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian calibration, process modeling and uncertainty quantification in biotechnology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Marie Helleckes, Michael Osthege, Wolfgang Wiechert, Eric von Lieres, Marco Oldiges</p>

High-throughput experimentation has revolutionized data-driven experimental sciences and opened the door to the application of machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the quality of any data analysis strongly depends on the quality of the data and specifically the degree to which random effects in the experimental data-generating process are quantified and accounted for. Accordingly calibration, i.e. the quantitative association between observed quantities and measurement responses, is a core element of many workflows in experimental sciences.
Particularly in life sciences, univariate calibration, often involving non-linear saturation effects, must be performed to extract quantitative information from measured data. At the same time, the estimation of uncertainty is inseparably connected to quantitative experimentation. Adequate calibration models that describe not only the input/output relationship in a measurement system but also its inherent measurement noise are required. Due to its mathematical nature, statistically robust calibration modeling remains a challenge for many practitioners, at the same time being extremely beneficial for machine learning applications.
In this work, we present a bottom-up conceptual and computational approach that solves many problems of understanding and implementing non-linear, empirical calibration modeling for quantification of analytes and process modeling. The methodology is first applied to the optical measurement of biomass concentrations in a high-throughput cultivation system, then to the quantification of glucose by an automated enzymatic assay. We implemented the conceptual framework in two Python packages, calibr8 and murefi, with which we demonstrate how to make uncertainty quantification for various calibration tasks more accessible. Our software packages enable more reproducible and automatable data analysis routines compared to commonly observed workflows in life sciences.
Subsequently, we combine the previously established calibration models with a hierarchical Monod-like ordinary differential equation model of microbial growth to describe multiple replicates of <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> batch cultures. Key process model parameters are learned by both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, highlighting the flexibility of the statistical and computational framework.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality improvement of saliva by chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks: a randomized experimental trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bubble tea drinks contain tea and tapioca pearls. Chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks may increase salivary components. Because of its proteins, inorganic components, and enzymes, saliva plays an important role in the body’s defense against bacteria and viruses. This study aims to analyze the effect of chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks on salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) and calcium (Ca) levels. Methods: The inclusion criterion was 18–25 years of age. The exclusion criteria were receiving medication, using dentures, a history of dry mouth, smoking and systemic disease. In the first week of the experiment, subjects drank bubble tea with tapioca pearls for three days (intervention week). In the second week, the same subjects drank tea without pearls for three days (control week). Each subject drank the bubble tea for 5 minutes per day over 3 days. Saliva samples were collected on the first day before bubble tea consumption (pretest) and on the third day after tea consumption (posttest). Saliva collection was performed in the morning (09:00 am–12:00 pm) for 1 minute. Sixty saliva samples were collected from 15 subjects. Salivary CRP levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit, and Ca levels were determined using semi-quantitative test strips. Results: Salivary CRP decreased significantly on the third day in the intervention group but showed no significant difference with the control group. Calcium levels increased significantly on the third day in both groups. Conclusion: Bubble tea drinks could improve the quality of saliva by decreasing salivary CRP and increasing Ca levels. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04670341 (17th December 2020).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An adaptive calibration technique for thermistor with varying temperature coefficient and reference resistance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A thermistor is a nonlinear sensor requiring a precise calibration technique to achieve accurate temperature measurements. This paper attempts to design a calibration technique employing artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The present work fulfills the following objectives: (i) to cover 100% input range in the linearity range measurement; (ii) to make the measurement technique adaptive to variations in reference resistance and thermistor temperature coefficient using a calibration technique. Methods: An ANN-based calibration circuit is cascaded to the data conversion circuit. Optimized ANN is trained with linear data independent of reference resistance and temperature coefficient effects on thermistor output. ANN optimization is performed by comparing various schemes, algorithms, and numbers of hidden layers to achieve a minimum mean square error and a regression close to 1. Results: The proposed technique provides a linear relationship for the system over the entire input range and avoids the requirement of repeated calibrations each time the thermistor is replaced. Practical data are used to validate the proposed measurement technique. Conclusions: The objectives and proposed technique have been demonstrated by results with a root mean square percentage error of 1.8%.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Leigh Syndrome: A Study of 209 Patients at the Beijing Children's Hospital</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. In the largest patient collection to date, this study aimed to provide new insights into the clinical and genetic spectrum of LS, defect-specific associations, and predictors of disease course and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, metabolic, neuroimaging, onset, and survival data were collected from the medical records of 209 patients referred to the Beijing Children's Hospital with symmetrical basal ganglia and/or brainstem neuroimaging changes indicative of LS by 30 centers from the Chinese network of mitochondrial disease (mitoC-NET) between January 2013 and July 2021 for exploratory analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants were identified in 52 genes, most frequently <i>MT-ATP6</i>, <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>PDHA1</i>. Maternally inherited variants accounted for 42% (heteroplasmy level ≥90% in 64%). Phenotypes spanned 92 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Elevated serum lactate (144/195), global developmental delay (142/209), and developmental regression (103/209) were most frequent. Discriminating neuroimaging and/or clinical features were identified for <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.9176T&gt;C), <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>PDHA1</i>, <i>SUCLG1</i>, and <i>SURF1</i>. Poorest survival was associated with <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.8993T&gt;C and m.9176T&gt;C), <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>ALDH5A1</i> (≤50% 3 year's survival), in contrast to milder defects with specific treatment (<i>ECHS1</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i>, 100% 3 year's survival).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data define phenotype, onset, and survival of LS in a defect-specific manner, identifying features discriminating between genetic defects and predictive of disease outcome. These findings are essential to early diagnosis, in optimizing family counseling, and to the design and monitoring of future clinical trials, the next frontier of LS research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">State-dependent representations of mixtures by the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems are often tasked to analyse complex signals from the environment, separating relevant from irrelevant parts. This process of decomposing signals is challenging when a mixture of signals does not equal the sum of its parts, leading to an unpredictable corruption of signal patterns. In olfaction, nonlinear summation is prevalent at various stages of sensory processing. Here, we investigate how the olfactory system deals with binary mixtures of odours under different brain states, using two-photon imaging of olfactory bulb (OB) output neurons. Unlike previous studies using anaesthetised animals, we found that mixture summation is more linear in the early phase of evoked responses in awake, head-fixed mice performing an odour detection task, due to dampened responses. Despite this, and responses being more variable, decoding analyses indicated that the data from behaving mice was well discriminable. Curiously, the time course of decoding accuracy did not correlate strictly with the linearity of summation. Further, a comparison with naïve mice indicated that learning to accurately perform the mixture detection task is not accompanied by more linear mixture summation. Finally, using a simulation, we demonstrate that, while saturating sublinearity tends to degrade the discriminability, the extent of the impairment may depend on other factors, including pattern decorrelation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the mixture representation in the primary olfactory area is state-dependent, but the analytical perception may not strictly correlate with linearity in summation.

                Cholinergic and sympathetic counter-regulatory networks control numerous physiologic functions including learning/memory/cognition, stress responsiveness, blood pressure, heart rate and energy balance. As neurons primarily utilize glucose as their primary metabolic energy source, we generated mice with increased glycolysis in cholinergic neurons by specific deletion of the fructose-2,6-phosphatase protein TIGAR. Steady-state and stable isotope flux analyses demonstrated increased rates of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA production, acetylcholine levels and density of neuromuscular synaptic junction clusters with enhanced acetylcholine release. The increase in cholinergic signaling reduced blood pressure and heart rate with a remarkable resistance to cold-induced hypothermia. These data directly demonstrate that increased cholinergic signaling through the modulation of glycolysis has several metabolic benefits particularly to increase energy expenditure and heat production upon cold exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Large-scale orientational order in bacterial colonies during inward growth</a></h4>

              
                During colony growth, complex interactions regulate the bacterial orientation, leading to the formation of large-scale ordered structures, including topological defects, microdomains, and branches. These structures may benefit bacterial strains, providing invasive advantages during colonization. Active matter dynamics of growing colonies drives the emergence of these ordered structures. However, additional biomechanical factors also play a significant role during this process. Here we show that the velocity profile of growing colonies creates strong radial orientation during inward growth when crowded populations invade a closed area. During this process, growth geometry sets virtual confinement and dictates the velocity profile. Herein, flow-induced alignment and torque balance on the rod-shaped bacteria result in a new stable orientational equilibrium in the radial direction. Our analysis revealed that the dynamics of these radially oriented structures also known as aster defects, depend on bacterial length and can promote the survival of the longest bacteria around localized nutritional hot spots. The present results indicate a new mechanism underlying structural order and provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics of bacterial growth on complex surfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How clustered protocadherin binding specificity is tuned for neuronal self-/nonself-recognition</a></h4>

              
                The stochastic expression of fewer than 60 clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) isoforms provides diverse identities to individual vertebrate neurons and a molecular basis for self-/nonself-discrimination. cPcdhs form chains mediated by alternating <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions between apposed membranes, which has been suggested to signal self-recognition. Such a mechanism requires that cPcdh <i>cis</i> dimers form promiscuously to generate diverse recognition units, and that <i>trans</i> interactions have precise specificity so that isoform mismatches terminate chain growth. However, the extent to which cPcdh interactions fulfill these requirements has not been definitively demonstrated. Here, we report biophysical experiments showing that cPcdh <i>cis</i> interactions are promiscuous, but with preferences favoring formation of heterologous <i>cis</i> dimers. <i>Trans</i> homophilic interactions are remarkably precise, with no evidence for heterophilic interactions between different isoforms. A new C-type cPcdh crystal structure and mutagenesis data help to explain these observations. Overall, the interaction characteristics we report for cPcdhs help explain their function in neuronal self-/nonself-discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crystal structures of bacterial small multidrug resistance transporter EmrE in complex with structurally diverse substrates</a></h4>

              
                Proteins from the bacterial small multidrug resistance (SMR) family are proton-coupled exporters of diverse antiseptics and antimicrobials, including polyaromatic cations and quaternary ammonium compounds. The transport mechanism of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> transporter, EmrE, has been studied extensively, but a lack of high-resolution structural information has impeded a structural description of its molecular mechanism. Here we apply a novel approach, multipurpose crystallization chaperones, to solve several structures of EmrE, including a 2.9 Å structure at low pH without substrate. We report five additional structures in complex with structurally diverse transported substrates, including quaternary phosphonium, quaternary ammonium, and planar polyaromatic compounds. These structures show that binding site tryptophan and glutamate residues adopt different rotamers to conform to disparate structures without requiring major rearrangements of the backbone structure. Structural and functional comparison to Gdx-Clo, an SMR protein that transports a much narrower spectrum of substrates, suggests that in EmrE, a relatively sparse hydrogen bond network among binding site residues permits increased sidechain flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural progenitor mitotic wave is required for asynchronous axon outgrowth and morphology</a></h4>

              
                Spatiotemporal mechanisms generating neural diversity are fundamental for understanding neural processes. Here, we investigated how neural diversity arises from neurons coming from identical progenitors. In the dorsal thorax of <i>Drosophila</i>, rows of mechanosensory organs originate from the division of sensory organ progenitor (SOPs). We show that in each row of the notum, an anteromedial located central SOP divides first, then neighbouring SOPs divide, and so on. This centrifugal wave of mitoses depends on cell-cell inhibitory interactions mediated by SOP cytoplasmic protrusions and Scabrous, a secreted protein interacting with the Delta/Notch complex. Furthermore, when this mitotic wave was reduced, axonal growth was more synchronous, axonal terminals had a complex branching pattern and fly behaviour was impaired. We show that the temporal order of progenitor divisions influences the birth order of sensory neurons, axon branching and impact on grooming behaviour. These data support the idea that developmental timing controls axon wiring neural diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mendelian randomization suggests a bidirectional, causal relationship between physical inactivity and adiposity</a></h4>

              
                Physical inactivity and increased sedentary time are associated with excess weight gain in observational studies. However, some longitudinal studies indicate reverse causality where weight gain leads to physical inactivity and increased sedentary time. As observational studies suffer from reverse causality, it is challenging to assess the true causal directions. Here, we assess the bidirectional causality between physical inactivity, sedentary time and adiposity by bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis. We assessed genetic liability using results from genome-wide association studies for accelerometer-based physical activity and sedentary time in 91,105 individuals and for body mass index (BMI) in 806,834 individuals. We implemented Mendelian randomization using CAUSE method that accounts for pleiotropy and sample overlap using full genome-wide data. We also applied inverse variance-weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods using genome-wide significant variants only. We found evidence of bidirectional causality between sedentary time and BMI: longer sedentary time was causal for higher BMI [beta (95%CI) from CAUSE method: 0.11 (0.02, 0.2), P=0.02], and higher BMI was causal for longer sedentary time (0.13 (0.08, 0.17), P=6.3.x10<sup>-4</sup>). Our analyses suggest that higher moderate and vigorous physical activity are causal for lower BMI (moderate: -0.18 (-0.3,-0.05), P=0.006; vigorous: -0.16 (-0.24,-0.08), P=3.8x10<sup>-4</sup>), but indicate that the association between higher BMI and lower levels of physical activity is due to horizontal pleiotropy. The bidirectional, causal relationship between sedentary time and BMI suggests that decreasing sedentary time is beneficial for weight management, but also that targeting adiposity may lead to additional health benefits by reducing sedentary time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alterations of the axon initial segment in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Grey matter damage has been established as a key contributor to disability progression in multiple sclerosis. Aside from neuronal loss and axonal transections, which predominate in cortical demyelinated lesions, synaptic alterations have been detected in both demyelinated plaques and normal-appearing grey matter, resulting in functional neuronal damage. The axon initial segment is a key element of neuronal function, responsible for action potential initiation and maintenance of neuronal polarity. Despite several reports of profound axon initial segment alterations in different pathological models, among which experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, whether the axon initial segment is affected in multiple sclerosis is still unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed axon initial segments from control and multiple sclerosis tissue, focusing on layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons in the neocortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and performed analysis on the parameters known to control neuronal excitability, i.e., axon initial segment length and position. We found that the axon initial segment length was unchanged among the different multiple sclerosis samples, and not different from controls. In contrast, in both cell types, the axon initial segment position was altered, with an increased soma-axon initial segment gap, in both active and inactive demyelinated lesions. In addition, using a computational model, we show that this increased gap between soma and axon initial segment might increase neuronal excitability. Taken together, these results show for the first time changes of axon initial segments in multiple sclerosis, in active as well as inactive grey matter lesions in both neocortex and cerebellum, which might alter neuronal function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting neuronal homeostasis to prevent seizures</a></h4>

              
                Manipulating neuronal homeostasis, which enables neurons to regulate their intrinsic excitability, offers an attractive opportunity to prevent seizures. However, no anticonvulsant compounds have yet been reported that directly manipulate neuronal homeostasis. Here, we describe a novel class of anticonvulsant compounds, based on 4-tert-butyl-benzaldehyde (4-TBB), with a mode-of-action that includes increased expression of the homeostatic regulator Pumilio (Pum). In Drosophila and mouse we use a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced seizure model, and an electrically induced seizure model for refractory seizures to evaluate anticonvulsant efficacy. The pyrazole analogue (RAB216) demonstrates best efficacy, protecting 50% of mice from PTZ-induced seizure. Knock-down of Pum, in Drosophila, blocks anticonvulsive effects, whilst analysis of validated Pum targets show significant reductions following exposure of mouse brain to 4-TBB. This study provides proof-of-principle that anticonvulsant effects can be achieved through regulation of neuronal homeostasis and identifies a chemical lead compound for future development.

                Human brain demonstrates amazing readiness for speech and language learning at birth, but the auditory development preceding such readiness remains unknown. Cochlear implanted (CI) children with prelingual deafness provide a unique opportunity to study this developmental stage. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, we revealed that the brain of CI children was nearly irresponsive to sounds at CI hearing onset. With increasing CI experiences up to 32 months, the brain demonstrated function, region and hemisphere specific development. Most strikingly, the left anterior temporal lobe showed an oscillatory trajectory, changing in opposite phases for speech and noise. In addition, speech responses increased linearly in left sylvian parieto-temporal area and right inferior frontal gyrus, and noise responses changed in U shape in right supramarginal gyrus. Such cortical development predicted behavioral improvement. The study provides the first longitudinal brain imaging evidence for early auditory development preceding speech acquisition in the human brain.

                The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of repeated explicit instructions on visuomotor adaptation, awareness, and intermanual transfer. In a comprehensive study design, 48 participants performed center-out reaching movements before and during exposure to a 60 deg rotation of visual feedback. Awareness and intermanual transfer were then determined. Twelve participants each were assigned to one of the following adaptation conditions: gradual adaptation, sudden adaptation without instructions, sudden adaptation with a single instruction before adaptation, and sudden adaptation with multiple instructions before and during adaptation. The explicit instructions explained the nature of the visual feedback perturbation and were given using an illustration of a clock face. Analysis of adaptation indices revealed neither increased nor decreased adaptation after repeated instructions compared with a single instruction. Our data also show less adaptation with gradual than with sudden adaptation and less adaptation without than with instruction. These differences were pronounced at the beginning of adaptation; however, by the end of adaptation, all four groups reached similar levels of adaptation. In addition, we found significant group differences for the awareness index, with lower awareness after gradual adaptation than after sudden, instructed adaptation. Intermanual transfer did not differ between groups. However, we found a significant correlation between the awareness and intermanual transfer indices. We conclude that the magnitude of the explicit process cannot be further increased by repeated instruction and that intermanual transfer appears to be largely related to the explicit adaptation process.

                The fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) with the plasma membrane (PM) proceeds through intermediate steps that remain poorly resolved. Additionally, the effect of persistent high or low exocytosis activity on intermediate steps remains unknown. Through time-resolved cryo-electron tomography, we ordered events into a sequence. Following stimulation, proximal tethered SVs rapidly form additional tethers with the PM. Simultaneously, fusion initiation occurs by membrane curvature ("buckling") of the SV and PM. It is followed by the formation of a fusion pore, and the collapse of SV membrane. At this time, membrane-proximal, but not membrane-distal, vesicles lose their interconnections, allowing them to move towards the PM. Two mutations of SNAP-25 that arrests or disinhibit spontaneous release, respectively, both caused a loss of interconnectors, while the disinhibiting mutant also caused a loss of membrane proximal multiple-tethered SVs. Overall, tether formation and connector dissolution is triggered by stimulation and respond to the spontaneous fusion rate. These morphological observations likely correspond to the transition of SVs from one functional pool to another.

                As transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) protocols advance, assumptions underlying the technique need to be retested to ensure they still hold. Whilst the safety of stimulation has been demonstrated mainly for a small number of sessions, and small sample size, adverse events (AEs) following multiple sessions remain largely untested. Similarly, whilst blinding procedures are typically assumed to be effective, the effect of multiple stimulation sessions on the efficacy of blinding procedures also remains under question. This is especially relevant in multisite projects where small unintentional variations in protocol could lead to inter-site difference. We report AE and blinding data from 1,019 participants who received up to 11 semi-consecutive sessions of active or sham transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), direct current stimulation (tDCS), and random noise stimulation (tRNS), at 4 sites in the UK and US. We found that AEs were often best predicted by factors other than tES, such as testing site or session number. Results from the blinding analysis suggested that blinding was less effective for tDCS and tACS than tRNS. The occurrence of AEs did not appear to be linked to tES despite the use of smaller electrodes or repeated delivery. However, blinding efficacy was impacted in tES conditions with higher cutaneous sensation, highlighting a need for alternative stimulation blinding protocols. This may be increasingly necessary in studies wishing to deliver stimulation with higher intensities.

                There is significant interest in pooling magnetic resonance image (MRI) data from multiple datasets to enable mega-analysis. Harmonization is typically performed to reduce heterogeneity when pooling MRI data across datasets. Most MRI harmonization algorithms do not explicitly consider downstream application performance during harmonization. However, the choice of downstream application might influence what might be considered as study-specific confounds. Therefore, ignoring downstream applications during harmonization might potentially limit downstream performance. Here we propose a goal-specific harmonization framework that utilizes downstream application performance to regularize the harmonization procedure. Our framework can be integrated with a wide variety of harmonization models based on deep neural networks, such as the recently proposed conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) harmonization model. Three datasets from three different continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans were used for evaluation. We found that cVAE removed more dataset differences than the widely used ComBat model, but at the expense of removing desirable biological information as measured by downstream prediction of mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores and clinical diagnoses. On the other hand, our goal-specific cVAE (gcVAE) was able to remove as much dataset differences as cVAE, while improving downstream cross-sectional prediction of MMSE scores and clinical diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory Tetanization to Induce LTP-Like Plasticity: A Review and Reassessment of the Approach</a></h4>

              
                Background: Great interest has been given to developing non-invasive approaches for studying cortical plasticity in humans. High frequency presentation of auditory and visual stimuli, or sensory tetanization, can induce LTP-like changes in cortical activity. However, contrasting effects across studies suggest that sensory tetanization may be unreliable. Method: We used sensory tetanization to try to induce auditory and visual LTP-like plasticity in younger and older adults. We measured auditory-evoked amplitude changes following tetanization to 1 kHz and 4 kHz tone bursts and following a slow-presentation control. We also measured visual-evoked amplitude changes following tetanization to horizontal and vertical sign gradients. Results: Auditory and visual response amplitudes decreased following tetanization, consistent with some studies but contrasting with others finding amplitude increases (i.e. LTP-Like). Older adults exhibited more modest auditory-evoked amplitude decreases, but visual-evoked amplitude decreases like those of younger adults. Changes in response amplitude were not specific to tetanized stimuli. Importantly, slow presentation of auditory tone-bursts produced changes in response amplitude that were like those observed following tetanization. Comparison with Existing Methods: A meta-analysis incorporating our results with studies employing similar tetanization techniques to study cortical plasticity revealed that the overall effect size across studies and labs is not significant, suggesting sensory tetanization does not produce reliable changes in cortical responses. Conclusions: We discuss our findings with respect to other inconsistent findings across the literature concerning stimulus specificity and age effects and conclude that sensory tetanization is an unreliable method for inducing human cortical plasticity in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural code for 'face cells' is not face specific</a></h4>

              
                'Face cells' are visual neurons that selectively respond more to faces than other objects. Clustered together in inferotemporal cortex, they are thought to form a network of modules specialized in face processing by encoding face-specific features. Here we reveal that their category selectivity is instead captured by domain-general attributes. Analyzing neural responses in and around macaque face patches to hundreds of objects, we discovered graded tuning for non-face objects that was more predictive of face preference than was tuning for faces themselves. The relationship between category-level face selectivity and image-level non-face tuning was not predicted by color and simple shape properties, but by domain-general information encoded in deep neural networks trained on object classification. These findings contradict the long-standing assumption that face cells owe their category selectivity to face-specific features, challenging the prevailing idea that visual processing is carried out by discrete modules, each specialized in a semantically distinct domain.

                Mutations in the human kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) gene were recently identified as a genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several KIF5A ALS variants cause exon 27 skipping and produce motor proteins with an altered C-terminal tail (referred to as {Delta}Exon27). However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of {Delta}Exon27 at the single-molecule, cellular, and organism levels. Our results show that {Delta}Exon27 is prone to form cytoplasmic aggregates and is neurotoxic. The mutation relieves motor autoinhibition and increases motor self-association, leading to drastically enhanced processivity on microtubules. Finally, ectopic expression of {Delta}Exon27 in Drosophila melanogaster causes wing defects, motor impairment, paralysis and premature death. Our results suggest gain of function as an underlying disease mechanism in KIF5A-associated ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral benefits of spatial attention explained by multiplicative gain, not receptive field shifts, in a neural network model</a></h4>

              
                Attention allows us to focus sensory processing on behaviorally relevant aspects of the visual world. Directing attention has been associated with a number of changes in sensory representation including multiplicative gain as well as shifts in the size and location of neuron receptive fields in early visual cortex. But, which, if any, of these physiological effects can account for the behavioral benefits of attention? Here we use a large scale computational model of primate visual cortex to perform a set of experiments in which we decouple changes in spatial tuning from changes in gain. We show that increased gain at cued locations in a neural network observer model mimics the improvement of human subjects on an attentional task with a spatial cue. Increasing gain resulted in changes in receptive field size and location similar to physiological effects, yet when we forced the model to use only these spatial tuning changes the model failed to produce any behavioral benefit. Instead, we found that gain alone was both necessary and sufficient to explain behavioral improvement during attention. Our results suggest that receptive field shifts are a result of the signal gain that boosts behavioral performance rather than the core mechanism of spatial attention.

                During speech comprehension, the ongoing context of a sentence is used to predict sentence outcome by limiting subsequent word likelihood. Neurophysiologically, violations of context-dependent predictions result in amplitude modulations of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) component. While N400 is widely used to measure semantic processing and integration, no publicly-available auditory stimulus set is available to standardize approaches across the field. Here, we developed an auditory stimulus set of 404 sentences that utilized the semantic anomaly paradigm, provided cloze probability for all stimuli, and was developed for both children and adults. With 20 neurotypical adults, we validated that this set elicits robust N400s, as well as two additional semantically-related ERP components: the late positivity component and the recognition potential. This stimulus set and the 20 high-density (128-channel) electrophysiological datasets are made publicly available here to promote data sharing and reuse. Future studies that use this stimulus set to investigate sentential semantic comprehension in both control and clinical populations may benefit from the increased comparability and reproducibility within this field of research.

                Recorded activity of cortical neurons during behavior is often analyzed with dimensionality reduction methods. The resulting oscillatory trajectories have been interpreted as signatures of latent oscillatory dynamical systems. Here we show that oscillatory trajectories arise as a consequence of the horseshoe effect after applying dimensionality reduction methods on signals that approximately exhibit continuous variation in time, regardless of whether latent oscillatory dynamical systems are present or not. We show that task-relevant information is instead contained in deviations between oscillatory trajectories, which we account for by introducing a new model that goes beyond the dichotomy between representational and dynamical systems models of neural activity. Our findings help interpret the results of dimensionality reduction analyses.

                Neuroimaging studies have identified multiple face-selective areas. In the current study we compared the functional response of the face area in the lateral prefrontal cortex to that of other face-selective areas. In Experiment 1 participants (N=32) were scanned viewing videos containing faces, bodies, scenes, objects, and scrambled objects. We identified a face-selective area in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). In Experiment 2 participants (N=24) viewed the videos or static images. Results showed that the rIFG, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and occipital face area (OFA) exhibited a greater response to moving than static faces. In Experiment 3 participants (N=18) viewed face videos presented in the contralateral and ipsilateral visual fields. Results showed that the face areas in the IFG and pSTS responded equally to faces in both visual fields, while the OFA and fusiform face area (FFA) showed a contralateral bias. These experiments suggest two conclusions; firstly, in all three experiments the face area in the IFG was not as reliably identified as face areas in the occipitotemporal cortex. Secondly, the similarity of the response patterns in the IFG and pSTS face areas suggests that the areas are functionally connected, a conclusion consistent with neuroanatomical and functional connectivity evidence.

                Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is the main mosquito vector for dengue and other arboviral infectious diseases. Control of this important vector highly relies on the use of insecticides, especially pyrethroids. Nevertheless, the development of pyrethroid resistance is a major obstacle to mosquito/disease control worldwide. Here, we focused on the mutations in the target site of pyrethroid insecticides, voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Vssc), and found that Ae. aegypti collected from Vietnam has the L982W allele in the Vssc at a high frequency (>79%). L982W mutation is located in the highly conserved region of Vssc that is associated with sodium-ion selectivity and permeation rate. Strains having the L982W allele showed similar or even higher levels of resistance to pyrethroids than those having V1016G, a typical knockdown resistance allele in Asia. Furthermore, concomitant mutations L982W+F1534C and V1016G+F1534C were confirmed, and strains having these multiple Vssc mutations exhibited incomparably higher levels of pyrethroid resistance than any other field population ever reported. Molecular modeling analysis confirmed that these concomitant mutant alleles could interfere with approaching pyrethroid to Vssc. Remarkably, >90% of Vssc of Ae. aegypti were occupied by these hyper insecticide-resistant haplotypes in Phnom Penh city, Cambodia. Analysis of whole Vssc coding genes suggested that Vsscs have evolved into stronger resistant forms efficiently through gene recombination events. At this point, L982W has never been detected in Vssc of Ae. aegypti from any other neighboring countries. We strongly emphasize the need to be vigilant about these strong resistance genes spreading to the world through Indochina Peninsula.

                Taste detection and hunger state dynamically regulate the decision to initiate feeding. To study how context-appropriate feeding decisions are generated, we combined synaptic resolution circuit reconstruction with targeted genetic access to specific neurons to elucidate a gustatory sensorimotor circuit for feeding initiation in Drosophila melanogaster. This circuit connects gustatory sensory neurons to proboscis motor neurons through three intermediate layers. Most of the neurons in this pathway are necessary and sufficient for proboscis extension, a feeding initiation behavior, and respond selectively to sugar taste detection. Hunger signals act at select second-order neurons to increase feeding initiation in food-deprived animals. In contrast, a bitter taste pathway inhibits premotor neurons, illuminating a central mechanism that weighs sugar and bitter tastes to promote or inhibit feeding. Together, these studies reveal the neural circuit basis for the integration of external taste detection and internal nutritive state to flexibly execute a critical feeding decision.

                Animal experiments have demonstrated the dependency of CSF clearance function on age and sleep, which partially underlay the cognitive decline in the elderly. However, evidence is lacking in humans mainly due to limited method to assess CSF clearance function. We aimed to image CSF clearance pathways in human brain by dynamic MRI with intrathecal contrast agent as a CSF tracer. We performed T1-weighted and T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging with equal sequence parameters before and at multiple time points after intrathecal injection of contrast agent to visualize the putative meningeal lymphatic pathway, peri-olfactory nerve pathway and peri-optic nerve pathway. We defined the CSF clearance function as the percentage change in signal unit ratio of critical locations in these pathways from baseline to 39 hours after intrathecal injection. CSF clearance through the putative meningeal lymphatic and peri-neural pathways were clearly visualized in all 85 patients. The CSF clearance function of meningeal lymphatic and peri-neural pathways were reduced with aging (all P < 0.05). The CSF clearance function through peri-olfactory nerve pathway was positive correlated with sleep quality and cognitive function (both P < 0.05). Moreover, the CSF clearance function through peri-olfactory nerve pathway mediated the association of sleep quality with cognitive function (percent change in {beta} [bootstrap 95% confidence interval]: 35% [-0.220, -0.003]). The study shows promise for dynamic MRI with intrathecal injection of contrast agent as a method to assess CSF clearance function through putative peri-neural pathways, and interprets the impaired clearance through putative peri-olfactory nerve pathway may explain the cognitive decline in patients with dyssomnia.

                The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) modulates social behaviors across species and may play a developmental role for these behaviors and their mediating neural pathways. Despite having high, stable levels of OXT receptor (OXTR) ligand binding from birth, endopiriform nucleus (EPN) remains understudied. EPN integrates olfactory and gustatory input and has bilateral connections with several limbic areas. Because the role of OXTR signaling in EPN is unknown, we sought to provide anatomical and electrophysiological information about OXTR signaling in mouse EPN neurons. Using in situ hybridization, we found that most EPN neurons co-express Oxtr mRNA and the marker for VGLUT1 and are thus glutamatergic cells. Based on high levels of OXTR ligand binding in EPN, we hypothesized that oxytocin application would modulate activity in these cells as measured by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Bath application of OXT and an OXTR specific ligand (TGOT) increased the excitability of EPN neurons in wild-type, but not in OXTR-knockout tissue. These results show an effect of OXT on a presumably glutamatergic cell population within EPN. Given the robust, relatively stable OXTR expression in EPN throughout life, OXTR in this multi-sensory and limbic integration area may be important for modulating activity in response to an array of social or other salient stimuli throughout the lifespan and warrants further study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A sporadic Alzheimer's blood-brain barrier model for developing ultrasound-mediated delivery of Aducanumab and anti-Tau antibodies.</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major impediment to therapeutic intracranial drug delivery for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Focused ultrasound applied together with microbubbles (FUS+MB) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS+MB is safe, however the effects of FUS+MB on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells (induced brain endothelial cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We then developed a human sporadic AD BBB cell platform to investigate the effects of FUS+MB on BBB cells and screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies. Results: We utilized this robust and reproducible human BBB model to demonstrate increased delivery of therapeutic AD antibodies across the BBB following FUS+MB treatment, including an analogue of Aducanumab (AduhelmTM; anti-amyloid-{beta}) and a novel anti-Tau antibody RNF5. Our results also demonstrate the safety of FUS+MB indicated by minimal changes in the cell transcriptome as well as little or no changes in cell viability and inflammatory responses within the first 24 h post FUS+MB. Finally, we report a more physiologically relevant hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a key development for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery screening, with potentially higher translational utility. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate an important translatable patient BBB cell model for identifying FUS+MB-deliverable drugs and screening for cell- and patient-specific effects of FUS+MB, accelerating the use of FUS+MB as a therapeutic modality in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drawing the experience dynamics of meditation.</a></h4>

              
                Subjective experiences are hard to capture quantitatively without losing depth and nuance. Subjective report analyses are time-consuming, with their interpretation contested. We describe Temporal Experience Tracing, a method that captures relevant aspects of the unified conscious experience over a continuous period of time. This continuous multidimensional description of experiences allows us to computationally reconstruct common experience states. Applied to data from 852 meditations - from novice (n=20) and an experienced (n=12) meditators practising Breathing, Loving-Kindness (LK) and Open-Monitoring (OM) meditation - we reconstructed four recurring experience states with an average duration of 6:46 min (SD = 5:50 min) and their transition dynamics. Three of the experience states assimilated the three meditation styles practiced, and a fourth experience state represented a common low-motivational, off-task state for both groups. We found that participants in both groups spent more time in the task-related experience state during LK meditation than during Breathing and OM, and were less likely to transition into an off-task experience state during LK meditation than during Breathing meditation. We demonstrate that drawing the dynamics of experience enables the quantitative analysis of subjective experiences, transforming the time dimension of the stream of consciousness from narrative to measurable.

                The biological basis of Alzheimers dementia has been hypothesized in terms of basal forebrain cholinergic decline, and in terms reflecting the neuropathologies surrounding beta amyloid and tau. To shed light on the contributions of these different biological elements, we performed five month intermittent stimulation of the basal forebrain, which projects to the cortical mantle, in 5xFAD Alzheimers model mice and wild-type littermates, and subjected mice to behavioral testing and tissue analysis. The 5xFAD mice performed worse in water maze testing than their littermates. Stimulation improved both classes of mice, and removed performance differences between genotypes by the fifth testing day. Stimulated groups had two to four-fold increases in immunoblot measures of each of the neurotrophin receptors tropomyosin receptor kinase A and B. Stimulation also led to lower tissue A{beta}42 and beta amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 in 5xFAD mice. Despite the lack of strong direct projections from the basal forebrain stimulation region to the hippocampus, the hippocampal tissues in stimulated mice had more nerve growth factor receptor, and lower levels of beta secretase for amyloid. These data support a causal relation between forebrain cholinergic pathways and cognitive decline dependent on A{beta}42. Activation of cholinergic brain pathways improves neurotrophin pathways and reduces A{beta}42 accumulation. The recruitment of both classes of neurotrophin receptors in the process suggests a serine protease cleavage intermediary between cholinergic response and neurotrophin activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biological constraints on stereotaxic targeting of functionally-defined cortical areas</a></h4>

              
                Understanding computational principles in hierarchically organized sensory systems requires functional parcellation of brain structures and their precise targeting for manipulations. Although brain atlases are widely used to infer area locations in the mouse neocortex, it has been unclear whether stereotaxic coordinates based on standardized brain morphology accurately represent functional domains in individual animals. Here, we used intrinsic signal imaging to evaluate the accuracy of area delineation in the atlas by mapping functionally-identified auditory cortices onto bregma-based stereotaxic coordinates. We found that auditory cortices in the brain atlas correlated poorly with the true complexity of functional area boundaries. Inter-animal variability in functional area locations predicted surprisingly high error rates in stereotaxic targeting with atlas coordinates. This variability was not simply attributed to brain sizes or suture irregularities but instead reflected differences in cortical geography across animals. Our data thus indicate that functional mapping in individual animals is essential for dissecting cortical area-specific roles with high precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex and estrous cycle affect experience-dependent plasticity in mouse primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sex hormones can affect cellular physiology and modulate synaptic plasticity, but it is not always clear whether or how sex-dependent differences identified in vitro express themselves as functional dimorphisms in the brain. Historically, most experimental neuroscience has been conducted using only male animals and the literature is largely mute about whether including female mice in will introduce variability due to inherent sex differences or endogenous estrous cycles. Though this is beginning to change following an NIH directive that sex should be included as a factor in vertebrate research, the lack of information raises practical issues around how to design experimental controls and apply existing knowledge to more heterogeneous populations. Various lines of research suggest that visual processing can be affected by sex and estrous cycle stage. For these reasons, we performed a series of in vivo electrophysiological experiments to characterize baseline visual function and experience-dependent plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of male and female mice. We find that sex and estrous stage have no statistically significant effect on baseline acuity measurements, but that both sex and estrous stage have can modulate two mechanistically distinct forms of experience dependent cortical plasticity. We also demonstrate that resulting variability can be largely controlled with appropriate normalizations. These findings suggest that V1 plasticity can be used for mechanistic studies focusing on how sex hormones effect experience dependent plasticity in the mammalian cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seasonal changes in membrane structure and excitability in central neurons of goldfish (Carassius auratus) under constant environmental conditions</a></h4>

              
                Seasonal modifications in the structure of cellular membranes occur as an adaptive measure to withstand exposure to prolonged environmental change. Little is known about whether such changes may occur independently of external cues, such as photoperiod or temperature, or how they may impact the central nervous system (CNS). We compared membrane properties of central neurons isolated from the retina of goldfish (Carassius auratus), an organism well-adapted to extreme environmental change, during the summer and winter months. Goldfish were maintained in a facility under constant environmental conditions throughout the year. Analysis of whole-retina phospholipid composition using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics revealed a two-fold increase in phosphatidylethanolamine species during the winter, suggesting an increase in cell membrane fluidity. Atomic force microscopy was used to produce localized, nanoscale-force deformation of neuronal membranes. Measurement of Young's modulus indicated increased membrane stiffness (or decreased elasticity) in neurons isolated during the winter. Voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to assess physiological changes in neurons between seasons. Winter neurons displayed a hyperpolarized reversal potential (Vrev) and a significantly lower input resistance (Rin) compared to summer neurons. This was indicative of a decrease in membrane excitability during the winter. Subsequent measurement of intracellular Ca2+ activity using Fura-2 microspectrofluorometry confirmed a reduction in action potential activity, including duration and action potential profile, in neurons isolated during the winter. These studies demonstrate chemical and biophysical changes that occur in central neurons of goldfish throughout the year without exposure to seasonal cues, and suggest a novel mechanism of seasonal regulation of CNS activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-of-day matters - pronounced regional morning-to-evening effects in structural brain metrics</a></h4>

              
                In recent decades magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has established itself as the golden standard for studying human brain structure in health and disease. As a result, it has become increasingly more important to identify factors that may influence study outcomes and contribute to misleading conclusions. With the regional time-of-day (TOD) differences in structural brain metrics utterly neglected and several studies reporting inconsistent TOD changes on the global brain level, this work set out to investigate this phenomenon with voxel-based (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) using the largest longitudinal dataset to date (N = 77). VBM revealed ubiquitous and often bilaterally symmetric differences in local grey and white matter volume across multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions. The impact of TOD on regional SBM indices was less pronounced than for VBM, and no significant effects were observed for the global volume- and surface-based anatomical metrics. Our findings likely reflect a combination of experience- and circadian-related processes, with the former possibly linked to memory formation. By showing that TOD has a prevalent effect on local anatomical brain metrics, our study underlines the need for this factor to be strictly controlled at the stage of experimental planning and data analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human NMDAR autoantibodies disrupt excitatory-inhibitory balance leading to hippocampal network hypersynchrony</a></h4>

              
                Specific autoantibodies against the NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) GluN1 subunit cause severe and debilitating NMDAR-encephalitis. Autoantibodies induce prototypic disease symptoms resembling schizophrenia, including psychosis and cognitive dysfunction. Using a mouse passive transfer model applying human monoclonal anti-GluN1-autoantibodies, we observed CA1 pyramidal neuron hypoexcitability, reduced AMPA-receptor (AMPAR) signaling, and faster synaptic inhibition resulting in disrupted excitatory-inhibitory balance. Functional alterations were supported by widespread remodeling of the hippocampal proteome, including changes in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. At the network level, anti-GluN1-autoantibodies amplified gamma oscillations and disrupted theta-gamma coupling. A data-informed network model revealed that lower AMPAR strength and faster GABAA-receptor current kinetics chiefly account for these abnormal oscillations. As predicted by our model and evidenced experimentally, positive allosteric modulation of AMPARs alleviated aberrant gamma activity and thus reinforced the causative effects of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Collectively, NMDAR-hypofunction-induced aberrant synaptic, cellular, and network dynamics provide new mechanistic insights into disease symptoms in NMDAR-encephalitis and schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological alterations in microglial morphology associate with the sleep-wake cycle in a brain region-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Long-term total sleep deprivation induces changes in cortical - and hippocampal microglial morphology that closely resemble the microglial response to the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A recent study found evidence that microglia could modify vigilance-states/sleep, but only few studies investigated microglial throughout the diurnal behavioral inactivity/activity pattern or the naturally occurring sleep-wake cycle, and those who have, only concentrated on the cortical or hippocampal microglia. As microglia demonstrate regional heterogeneity, we compared microglial diurnal morphological alterations in the somatosensory cortex (SC) and dorsal hippocampus (HC) to the basal forebrain (BF), which is a subcortical brain area involved in the regulation of vigilance states. We collected mouse brain samples every 3h throughout the 24h light-dark-cycle and applied a 3D reconstruction method for the acquired confocal microscopy images for each brain area separately. While microglial regional heterogeneity was evident, stimulation of microglia with LPS caused comparable microglial responses in all brain areas. When comparing microglial features between the 12h light- and dark periods, regional heterogeneity re-appeared. As most of the morphological alterations occurred during the light period-the habitual sleeping period of the mice, we performed polysomnography to study the possible interaction of microglial morphology and sleep. We found that cortical-, but not HC- or BF microglial territory and volume negatively correlated with sleep slow-wave activity (SWA), an electroencephalic feature of non-REM sleep (NREMS). Since microglia are sensitive to neuronal activity, we propose that the regional differences reflect vigilance-state specific neuronal activity patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic firing of neurons in the medulla of conscious freely behaving rats: rhythmic coupling with baroreceptor input</a></h4>

              
                Recent investigations emphasized the importance of neural control of cardiovascular adjustments in complex behaviors, including stress, exercise, arousal, sleep-wake states, and different tasks. Baroreceptor feedback is an essential component of this system acting on different time scales from maintaining stable levels of cardiovascular parameters on the long-term to rapid alterations according to behavior. The baroreceptor input is essentially rhythmic, reflecting periodic fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. Cardiac rhythm is a prominent feature of the autonomic control system, present on different levels, including neuron activity in central circuits. The mechanism of rhythmic entrainment of neuron firing by the baroreceptor input was studied in great detail under anesthesia but recordings of sympathetic-related neuron firing in freely moving animals remain extremely scarce. In this study we recorded multiple single neuron activity in the reticular formation of the medulla in freely moving rats during natural behavior. Neurons firing in synchrony with the cardiac rhythm were detected in each experiment (n=4). In agreement with prior observations in anesthetized cats, we found that neurons in this area exhibited high neuron-to-neuron variability and temporal flexibility in their coupling to cardiac rhythm in freely moving rats, as well. This included firing in bursts at multiples of cardiac cycles, but not directly coupled to the heartbeat, supporting the concept of baroreceptor input entraining intrinsic neural oscillations rather than imposing a rhythm of solely external origin on these networks. It may also point to a mechanism of maintaining the basic characteristics of sympathetic neuron activity, i.e. burst-discharge and cardiac-related rhythmicity, on the background of behavior-related adjustments in their firing rate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical organization of spontaneous co-fluctuations in densely-sampled individuals using fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Edge time series decompose FC into its framewise contributions. Previous studies have focused on characterizing the properties of high-amplitude frames, including their cluster structure. Less is known about middle- and low-amplitude co-fluctuations. Here, we address those questions directly, using data from two dense-sampling studies: the MyConnectome project and Midnight Scan Club. We develop a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group peak co-fluctuations of all magnitudes into nested and multi-scale clusters based on their pairwise concordance. At a coarse scale, we find evidence of three large clusters that, collectively, engage virtually all canonical brain systems. At finer scales, however, each cluster is dissolved, giving way to increasingly refined patterns of co-fluctuations involving specific sets of brain systems. We also find an increase in global co-fluctuation magnitude with hierarchical scale. Finally, we comment on the amount of data needed to estimate co-fluctuation pattern clusters and implications for brain-behavior studies. Collectively, the findings reported here fill several gaps in current knowledge and provide some practical guidance for future studies.

	<p>Training with visual and auditory biofeedback, in patients with stroke, improved balance ability and asymmetric posture. We developed a new biofeedback training device to prevent falls and improve balance ability in patients with stroke. This device corrects motion errors by collecting the pressure information of patients in real-time. This randomized crossover study aimed to investigate the effect of this biofeedback training on the static balance ability and weight distribution symmetry index in 24 patients with chronic stroke. Pressure sensor-based vibrotactile biofeedback, visual biofeedback providing posture information, and standing without biofeedback were randomly applied for 1 d each with 24 h washout intervals to minimize adaptation. The static balance ability was measured for each biofeedback training type, and the weight distribution symmetry index was calculated using the collected weight-bearing rate data. The static balance ability and weight distribution symmetry index differed significantly according to the type of biofeedback training used. Post-hoc analysis revealed significant differences in the order of newly developed vibrotactile biofeedback, visual biofeedback, and standing without biofeedback. These findings provide evidence that pressure sensor-based vibrotactile biofeedback improves static balance ability and weight support rates by proposing better intervention for patients with chronic stroke in the clinical environment.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Computation estimation is the ability to provide an approximate answer to a complex arithmetic problem without calculating it exactly. Despite its importance in daily life, the neuronal network underlying computation estimation is largely unknown. Methods: We looked at the neuronal correlates of two computational estimation strategies: approximated calculation and sense of magnitude (SOM)&amp;amp;ndash;intuitive representation of magnitude, without calculation. During an fMRI scan, thirty-one college students judged whether the result of a two-digit multiplication problem was larger or smaller than a given reference number. In two different blocks, they were asked to use a specific strategy (AC or SOM). Results: The two strategies activated brain regions related to calculation, numerical cognition, decision-making, and working memory. AC more than SOM elicited activations in multiple, domain-specific brain regions in the parietal lobule, including the left SMG (BA 40), the bilateral superior parietal lobule (BA 7), and the right inferior parietal lobule (BA 7). The activation level of the IFG was positively correlated to individual accuracy, indicating that the IFG has an essential role in both strategies. Conclusions: These finding suggest that the analogic code of magnitude is more involved in the AC than the SOM strategy.</p>

	<p>Deficits in social cognition are a core feature of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare profiles of self-perceived abilities across the core domains of emotional functioning between patients with schizophrenia (n = 22), major depressive disorder (n = 31) and healthy participants (n = 43) with the Self-report Emotional Ability Scale (SEAS). Profile analyses were used to explore group differences in the overall level of self-perceived effectiveness of emotional functioning and in the patterns in which the four functions of emotion perception and regulation in the intra- and inter-personal domains are arranged to each other. Both patient groups showed significantly lower overall levels of self-perceived emotional functioning compared to healthy controls. Most importantly, we found significant differences between patient groups in their profile patterns. Patients with schizophrenia indicated experiencing difficulties in all investigated domains, but the profile pattern largely matched that of healthy individuals. Instead, the profile of patients with depression was much more accentuated, showing lower perceived effectiveness of emotion perception and regulation in the intra-personal domain compared to inter-personal functions. Our results of disorder-specific emotional deficits may have profound implications for early screening and identification of at-risk populations as well as recovery-oriented interventions.</p>

	<p>Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique to investigate the residual brain functions of patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). Nonetheless, it is unclear how the networks that are more associated with primary functions, such as the sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor, medial/lateral visual and auditory networks, contribute to clinical assessment. In this study, we examined the rs-fMRI lower-order networks alongside their structural MRI data to clarify the corresponding association with clinical assessment. We studied 109 chronic patients with DoC and emerged from DoC with structural MRI and rs-fMRI: 65 in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness state (VS/UWS), 34 in minimally conscious state (MCS) and 10 with severe disability. rs-fMRI data were analyzed with independent component analyses and seed-based analyses, in relation to structural MRI and clinical data. The results showed that VS/UWS had fewer networks than MCS patients and the rs-fMRI activity in each network was decreased. Visual networks were correlated to the clinical status, and in cases where no clinical response occurred, rs-fMRI indicated distinctive networks conveying information in a similar way to other techniques. The information provided by single networks was limited, whereas the four networks together yielded better classification results, particularly when the model included rs-fMRI and structural MRI data (AUC = 0.80). Both quantitative and qualitative rs-fMRI analyses yielded converging results; vascular etiology might confound the results, and disease duration generally reduced the number of networks observed. The lower-order rs-fMRI networks could be used clinically to support and corroborate visual function assessments in DoC.</p>

	<p>Some symptoms of schizophrenia might be present before full-blown psychosis, so white matter changes must be studied both in individuals with emerging psychosis and chronic schizophrenia. A total of 86 patients&amp;amp;mdash;12 ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), 20 first episode psychosis (FEP), 54 chronic schizophrenia (CS), and 33 healthy controls (HC)&amp;amp;mdash;underwent psychiatric examination and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner. We assessed fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILS). We found that CS patients had lower FA than FEP patients (p = 0.025) and HC (p = 0.088), and higher MD than HC (p = 0.037) in the right SLF. In the CS group, we found positive correlations of MD in both right ILF (rho = 0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and SLF (rho = 0.43, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) with disorganization symptoms, as well as negative correlation of FA in the right ILF with disorganization symptoms (rho = &amp;amp;minus;0.43, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Among UHR individuals, we found significant negative correlations between MD in the left ILF and negative (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.74, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and general symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.77, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). However promising, these findings should be treated as preliminary, and further research must verify whether they can be treated as potential biomarkers of psychosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mice regulate their attentional intensity and arousal to exploit increases in task utility</a></h4>

              
                To meet their survival needs, organisms must continuously select which sensory stimuli to attend to and decide how much attention to pay. Attention's selective aspect has been a cornerstone of behavioral and physiological study, whereas attentional intensity is poorly understood. Autonomic arousal is thought to strongly influence attentional intensity, but evidence is lacking, including regarding if and how organisms self-regulate their arousal to match attentional intensity to its utility. Here, we developed an auditory attentional intensity task for head-fixed mice and vary task utility by changing reward size. We record pupil size and walking speed as proxies of arousal and exploration, respectively. Using simple performance metrics and sequential sampling modeling, we find that mice increase their attentional intensity during periods of high task utility. The utility-related attentional boost is partially mediated by stabilization of pupil-linked arousal around an optimal mid-sized level, and an associated reduction in exploratory behavior. In sum, self-regulation of arousal partially implements strategic attentional intensity allocation.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recollection of personal past events differs across the lifespan. Older individuals recall fewer episodic details and convey more semantic information than young. Here we examine how gray matter volumes in temporal lobe regions integral to episodic and semantic memory (hippocampus and temporal poles, respectively) are related to age differences in autobiographical recollection. Gray matter volumes were obtained in healthy young (<i>n</i> = 158) and old (<i>n</i> = 105) adults. The temporal pole was demarcated and hippocampus segmented into anterior and posterior regions to test for volume differences between age groups. The Autobiographical Interview was administered to measure episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Volume associations with episodic and semantic autobiographical memory were then assessed. Brain volumes were smaller for older adults in the posterior hippocampus. Autobiographical memory was less episodic and more semanticized for older versus younger adults. Older adults also showed positive associations between temporal pole volumes and episodic autobiographical recall; in the young, temporal pole volume was positively associated with performance on standard laboratory measures of semantic memory. Exploratory analyses revealed that age-related episodic autobiographical memory associations with anterior hippocampal volumes depended on sex. These findings suggest that age differences in brain structures implicated in episodic and semantic memory may portend reorganization of neural circuits to support autobiographical memory in later life.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental changes in cerebral NAD and neuroenergetics of an antioxidant compromised mouse model of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Defects in essential metabolic regulation for energy supply, increased oxidative stress promoting excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and phospholipid membrane dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). The knowledge about the developmental trajectory of these key pathophysiological components and their interplay is important to develop new preventive and treatment strategies. However, this assertion is so far limited. To investigate the developmental regulations of these key components, we assessed, for the first time, in vivo redox state from the oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD), energy and membrane metabolites, neurotransmitters ({gamma}-aminobutyrate and glutamate) by 31P and 1H MRS during the neurodevelopment of a SZ animal model with genetically compromised glutathione synthesis (gclm-KO mice). When compared to age-matched wild type (WT), an increase in NAD+/NADH redox ratio was found in gclm-KO mice until early adulthood, followed by a decrease in full adults as observed in patients. Especially, in early postnatal life (P20, corresponding to childhood), levels of several metabolites were altered in gclm-KO mice, including NAD+, ATP, phosphocreatine, intracellular pH, glutamine + glutamate and membrane phospholipids components, suggesting an interactive compensation for redox dysregulation between NAD, energy metabolism, and neurotransmission. The identified temporal neurometabolic regulations provide insights in preventive treatment targets for at-risk individuals, and other neurodevelopmental disorders involving oxidative stress and energetic dysfunction.

                Resurgent currents (INaR) produced by voltage-gated sodium channels are required for many neurons to maintain high-frequency firing, and contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and disease pathophysiology. Here we show, for the first time, that INaR can be reconstituted in a heterologous system by co-expression of sodium channel -subunits and A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). Specifically, A-type FHFs induces INaR from Nav1.8, Nav1.9 tetrodotoxin-resistant neuronal channels and, to a lesser extent, neuronal Nav1.7 and cardiac Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, we identified the N-terminus of FHF as the critical molecule responsible for A-type FHFs-mediated INaR. Among the FHFs, FHF4A is the most important isoform for mediating Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 INaR. In nociceptive sensory neurons, FHF4A knockdown significantly reduces INaR amplitude and the percentage of neurons that generate INaR, substantially suppressing excitability. Thus, our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying TTX-resistant INaR generation and provides important potential targets for pain treatment.

                Graded synapses in sensory systems reliably transmit small signals in the presence of continuous quantal noise. To understand how signaling is optimized during graded transmission, we counted the number of vesicles released by a mammalian cone terminal and compared it to the simultaneous responses in each Off bipolar cell type. Off bipolar cells contacting the terminal base comprised two groups depending on how they sampled transmitter release. In both groups, responses initially grew non-linearly with the number of released vesicles implicating a role for cooperativity during sparse release. One group sampled release from most of a cones approximately 20 ribbons and can exploit averaging to improve signal reliability. The other, less-sensitive group made 1-3 contacts at the terminal center and responded to pooled transmitter, a consequence of membrane depolarization, using an insensitive kainate receptor. Off bipolar cells use different strategies to minimize transmission noise and encode cone output over different ranges.

                Diverse neocortical GABAergic neurons specialise in synaptic targeting and their effects are modulated by presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) suppressing neurotransmitter release in rodents, but their effects in human neocortex are unknown. We tested whether activation of group III mGluRs by L-AP4 changes GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in two distinct dendritic spine-innervating GABAergic interneurons recorded in vitro in human neocortex. Calbindin-positive double bouquet cells (DBC) had columnar 'horsetail' axons descending through layers II-V innervating dendritic spines (48%) and shafts, but not somata of pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons. Parvalbumin-expressing dendrite-targeting cell (PV-DTC) axons extended in all directions innervating dendritic spines (22%), shafts (65%) and somata (13%). As measured, 20% of GABAergic neuropil synapses innervate spines, hence DBCs, but not PV-DTCs, preferentially select spine targets. Group III mGluR activation paradoxically increased the frequency of sIPSCs in DBCs (to median 137% of baseline), but suppressed it in PV-DTCs (median 92%), leaving the amplitude unchanged. The facilitation of sIPSCs in DBCs may result from their unique GABAergic input being disinhibited via network effect. We conclude that dendritic spines receive specialized, diverse GABAergic inputs, and group III mGluRs differentially regulate GABAergic synaptic transmission to distinct GABAergic cell types in human cortex.

                Nuclear position is precisely orchestrated during cell division, migration, and maturation of cells and tissues. Here we report a previously unrecognized, programmed movement of the nucleus in rat cochlear inner hair cells. This cell-type specific nuclear movement among hair cells of the inner ear offers a new glimpse into the cellular mechanisms involved in the functional maturation of inner hair cells. In early post-natal days, the nucleus sits at the very basal pole of the hair cell, far from the apically located mechano-transducing stereocilia, but close to where synapses with primary afferent and efferent neurons are forming. By maturity, the nucleus moves to occupy a new position half-way along the length of the cell. Remarkably, nuclear translocation happens quickly over the course of 1-2 post-natal days, coinciding with the onset of hearing. The movement of the nucleus likely signals the closing of a critical period correlated with the forming and refining of synapses at the onset of hearing.

                Visual perception plays a critical role in navigating space and extracting useful semantic information crucial to survival. To identify distant landmarks, we constantly shift gaze vectors through saccades, while still maintaining the visual perception of stable allocentric space. How can we sustain stable allocentric space so effortlessly? To solve this question, we have developed a new concept of NHT (Neural Holography Tomography). This model states that retinotopy is invisible (not available to consciousness) and must be converted to a time code by traveling alpha brainwaves to perceive objects consciously. According to this framework, if identical alpha phases are continually assigned to a landmark, we perceive its exact and consistent allocentric location. To test this hypothesis, we designed reaction time (RT) experiments to observe evidence of the predicted space-to-time conversion. Various visual stimuli were generated at a wide range of eccentricities either on a large TV (up to 40{degrees}) or by LED strips on a hemispherical dome (up to 60{degrees}). Participants were instructed to report the observed patterns promptly under either covert (no eye movement) or overt (with eye movement) conditions. As predicted, stimuli presented at the center of fixation always produced the fastest RTs. The additional RT delay was precisely proportional to the eccentricity of the peripheral stimulus presentation. Furthermore, both covert and overt attention protocols created the same RT delays, and trajectories of saccadic eye motions were in parallel to the overt RT vs. eccentricity. These findings strongly support our NHT model, in which the observed RT-eccentricity dependence is indicative of the spatiotemporal conversion required for maintaining a stable allocentric frame of reference. That is, we perceive space by time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural representations of vicarious rewards are linked to interoception and prosocial behaviour</a></h4>

              
                From likes on social media, to seeing other people eat in a restaurant, every day we constantly observe other people receiving rewards. Theoretical accounts posit that vicarious processing of these rewards might be linked to people sensitivity to internal body states (interoception) and facilitates a tendency to act prosocially to obtain positive outcomes for others. However, the neural processes underlying the links between vicarious reward processing, interoception and prosocial behaviour are poorly understood. Previous research has linked vicarious reward processing to the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) and the anterior insula (AI). Can we predict someone tendency to be prosocial, or their propensity to be aware of interoceptive signals, from variability in how the ACCg and AI process other people rewards? Here, participants monitored rewards being delivered to themselves or an anonymous stranger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a separate session, they performed a task measuring their willingness to be prosocial and exert effort to obtain rewards for others, and a task measuring their propensity to be aware and use interoceptive signals. Using multivariate similarity analysis, we show that people willingness to be prosocial is predicted by greater similarity between self and other representations in the ACCg. Moreover, greater dissimilarity in self-other representations in the AI is linked to a greater interoceptive propensity. These findings highlight that vicarious reward representations are linked to bodily signals in AI, and foster prosocial tendencies through the ACCg, with such information represented when simply seeing stimuli that indicate other people rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pinch2 is a novel regulator of myelination in the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                The extensive morphological changes of oligodendrocytes during axon ensheathment and myelination involve assembly of the Ilk-Parvin-Pinch (IPP) heterotrimeric complex of proteins to relay essential mechanical and biochemical signals between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Binding of Pinch 1 and 2 isoforms to Ilk is mutually exclusive and allows the formation of distinct IPP complexes with specific signaling properties. Using tissue-specific conditional gene ablation in mice, we reveal an essential role for Pinch2 during central nervous system myelination. Unlike Pinch1-gene ablation, loss of Pinch2 in oligodendrocytes results in hypermyelination and in the formation of pathological myelin outfoldings in white matter regions. These structural changes concurred with inhibition of Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 activities and phenocopied aspects of myelin pathology observed in corresponding mouse mutants. We propose a dual role for Pinch2 in preventing excess of myelin wraps through RhoA-dependent control of membrane growth and in fostering myelin stability via Cdc42-dependent organization of cytoskeletal septins. Together, these findings indicate that IPP-containing Pinch2 is a novel critical cell-autonomous molecular hub ensuring synchronous control of key signaling networks during developmental myelination.

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges to maintaining medical care for patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic (ParCoPa) survey was conducted as an online, nationwide, cross-sectional survey from December 2020 to March 2021 and aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the medical care of PD patients from the physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; perspective. Invitations containing a randomly generated registration code were mailed to healthcare professionals from sixty-seven specialty centers in Germany. Confounders for the worsening of subjective treatment quality, perceived health risk due to the profession, and adequate protective measures against SARS-CoV-2 were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Of all forty physicians who responded, 87.5% reported a worsening of motor and nonmotor symptoms in their patients, 97.5% experienced cancellation of appointments, and difficulties in organizing advanced and supplementary therapies were reported by over 95%. Participants offered alternative consultation options, mostly in the form of telephone (77.5%) or online (64.1%) consultations, but telephone consultations were the most accepted by patients (&amp;amp;ldquo;broadly accepted&amp;amp;rdquo;, 40.0%). We identified pandemic-related deficits in providing care for patients with PD and areas of improvement to ensure continued care for this vulnerable patient population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Reward Value Enhances Sequence Monitoring Ramping Dynamics as Ending Rewards Approach in the Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many fundamental human behaviors contain multiple sequences performed to reach a desired outcome, such as cooking. Reward is inherently associated with sequence completion and has been shown to generally enhance cognitive control. However, the impact of reward on cognitive sequence processing remains unexplored. To address this key question, we focused on the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC). This area is necessary and exhibits increasing ("ramping") activation during sequences, a dynamic that may be related to reward processing in other brain regions. To separate these dynamics, we designed a task where reward was only provided after multiple four-item sequences ("iterations"), rather than each individual sequence. Using fMRI in humans, we investigated three possible interactions of reward and sequential control signals in RLPFC: (1) with the visibility of sequential cues, i.e., memory; (2) equally across individual sequence iterations; and (3) differently across individual sequence iterations (e.g., increasing as reward approaches). Evidence from previous, nonsequential cognitive control experiments suggested that reward would uniformly change RLPFC activity across iterations and may depend on the visibility of cues. However, we found the influence of reward on RLPFC ramping increased across sequence iterations and did not interact with memory. These results suggest an active, predictive, and distinctive role for RLPFC in sequence monitoring and integration of reward information, consistent with extant literature demonstrating similar accelerating reward-related dopamine dynamics in regions connected to RLPFC. These results have implications for understanding sequential behavior in daily life, and when they go awry in disorders such as addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for Paracrine Protective Role of Exogenous {alpha}A-Crystallin in Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Expression and secretion of neurotrophic factors have long been known as a key mechanism of neuroglial interaction in the central nervous system. In addition, several other intrinsic neuroprotective pathways have been described, including those involving small heat shock proteins such as &alpha;-crystallins. While initially considered as a purely intracellular mechanism, both &alpha;A-crystallins and &alpha;B-crystallins have been recently reported to be secreted by glial cells. While an anti-apoptotic effect of such secreted &alpha;A-crystallin has been suggested, its regulation and protective potential remain unclear. We recently identified residue threonine 148 (T148) and its phosphorylation as a critical regulator of &alpha;A-crystallin intrinsic neuroprotective function. In the current study, we explored how mutation of this residue affected &alpha;A-crystallin chaperone function, secretion, and paracrine protective function using primary glial and neuronal cells. After demonstrating the paracrine protective effect of &alpha;A-crystallins secreted by primary Mu&#x0308;ller glial cells (MGCs), we purified and characterized recombinant &alpha;A-crystallin proteins mutated on the T148 regulatory residue. Characterization of the biochemical properties of these mutants revealed an increased chaperone activity of the phosphomimetic T148D mutant. Consistent with this observation, we also show that exogeneous supplementation of the phosphomimetic T148D mutant protein protected primary retinal neurons from metabolic stress despite similar cellular uptake. In contrast, the nonphosphorylatable mutant was completely ineffective. Altogether, our study demonstrates the paracrine role of &alpha;A-crystallin in the central nervous system as well as the therapeutic potential of functionally enhanced &alpha;A-crystallin recombinant proteins to prevent metabolic-stress induced neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Antidiabetic Drug Metformin Regulates Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel NaV1.7 via the Ubiquitin-Ligase NEDD4-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>The antidiabetic drug metformin has been shown to reduce pain hypersensitivity in preclinical models of chronic pain and in neuropathic pain in humans. Multiple intracellular pathways have been described as metformin targets. Among them, metformin is an activator of the adenosine 5'-monophosphate protein kinase that can in turn modulate the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 and thus post-translational expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<SUB>V</SUB>s). In this study, we found that the bulk of the effect of metformin on Na1.7 is dependent on NEDD4-2. In HEK cells, the expression of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 at the membrane fraction, obtained by a biotinylation approach, is only reduced by metformin when cotransfected with NEDD4-2. Similarly, in voltage-clamp recordings, metformin significantly reduced Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 current density when cotransfected with NEDD4-2. In mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, without changing the biophysical properties of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7, metformin significantly decreased Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 current densities, but not in <I>Nedd4L</I> knock-out mice (<I>SNS-Nedd4L</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>). In addition, metformin induced a significant reduction in NEDD4-2 phosphorylation at the serine-328 residue in DRG neurons, an inhibitory phosphorylation site of NEDD4-2. In current-clamp recordings, metformin reduced the number of action potentials elicited by DRG neurons from <I>Nedd4L<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>, with a partial decrease also present in <I>SNS-Nedd4L</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, suggesting that metformin can also change neuronal excitability in an NEDD4-2-independent manner. We suggest that NEDD4-2 is a critical player for the effect of metformin on the excitability of nociceptive neurons; this action may contribute to the relief of neuropathic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditure, productivity cost during pregnancy and COVID-19 impact on household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka; A study protocol [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservat</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,573 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

                Background:  India is endemic for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) malaria. Despite a decrease in incidence, its elimination is hampered by recurrences. This study aimed to characterize recurrences in Pv malaria and study its association with primaquine (PQ) usage. Methods:  Symptomatic adult Pv patients were followed-up for up to 23 months for recurrences. The time to recurrence was compared by the PQ dosage they received using a log-rank test. Results: Of the 294 malaria patients, 206 (70%) patients had Pv infection during the study period. A total of 20 (9.7%) recurrences were seen in 17 (8.2%) patients of Pv. The percentage of first-time recurrences were highest in the no PQ group (25%), followed by the weekly PQ group (20%), low dose daily PQ (8.2%) group, and high dose daily PQ group (3.1%). Conclusions: Recurrence in Pv malaria is common, especially in those who receive an inappropriate prescription of primaquine.

                Background: The present study was designed to isolate and identify the phyto-pathogen responsible for black rot of Citrus sinensis, and to determine its biological control measures. Methods: The pathogen was isolated from infected oranges and cultured on Luria-Bertani medium. Gram staining method was used to identify the morphological characteristics of the causal agents of the black rot. Advanced molecular technique was applied to facilitate proper detection of the isolated bacteria. Phylogenetic trees were analyzed using the Neighbor-Joining method. Antimicrobial screening was conducted by disc diffusion method. Antagonistic activity was evaluated by well diffusion method. Results: Gram staining of the causal agent showed rod shaped, small and pink bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplified an approximately 1465 bp product. The nucleotide sequences of the isolated bacterial sample 1 (BS1) and bacterial sample 2 (BS2) had 99.34% and 99.45% similarities with the reference of Serratia marcescens sequence in NCBI GenBank. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank. Two isolates showed virulence capability on some fresh fruits, which confirmed the stain detection and Koch’s postulates. Allium sativum extract showed the largest (27.33±1.5 mm) diameter of zone of inhibition against BS1, at 30µg/disc concentration. In the antagonistic assay, Rhizobium leguminosarum showed largest (19±1 mm) zone of inhibition against BS1. Conclusions: Findings of the current investigations are constructive for identification of causative pathogens in Citrus sinensis black rot disease and their biological control measures.

                Sustainability of research infrastructures (RIs) is a big challenge for funders, stakeholders and operators, and the development and adoption of adequate management tools is a major concern, namely tools for monitoring and evaluating their performance and impact. BioData.pt is the Portuguese Infrastructure of Biological and Portuguese node of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures "Landmark" ELIXIR. The foundations of this national research infrastructure were laid under the “Building BioData.pt” project, for four years. During this period, performance and impact indicators were collected and analysed under the light of international guidelines for assessing the performance and impact of European research infrastructures produced by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU-funded RI-PATHS project. The exercise shared herein showed that these frameworks can be adopted by national RIs, with the necessary adaptations, namely to reflect the national landscape and specificity of activities, and can be powerful tools in supporting the management of RIs. “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts”.

                Background: India is currently undergoing a demographic and epidemiological transition leading to the occurrence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which were once considered as disease of the elderly among the adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Dharwad district, Karnataka, including 1600 students between 11–17 years age group, across both private and government schools located in both rural and urban areas; information on socio-demographic variables, physical activity, dietary habits, substance abuse, and family history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and level of stress among participants was collected. Anthropometric measurements were taken, blood pressure was measured, general physical examination was done to look for signs of insulin resistance. Urine was examined for the presence of glucose using urine glucose strips in overweight children with ≥2 risk factors (American Diabetes Association criteria for children). Results: Prevalence of overweight/obesity was 4.6% and hypertension was 14.8%. Multivariate logistic regression done for variables found significant in univariate analysis on comparison of risk factors between overweight and normal children showed higher odds for family h/o diabetes (OR = 1.14, CI: 0.58–2.23), private school (OR = 1.5, CI: 0.75–2.96), high socio-economic status (OR = 2.0, CI: 0.95–4.30), hypertension (OR = 2.0, CI: 0.95–4.30) and acanthosis nigricans (OR = 219, CI: 71.49–672.42) among overweight and for variables found significant in univariate analysis on comparison of risk factors between hypertensives and normotensives showed higher odds for inadequate sleep (OR = 1.4, CI: 1.00–1.87), private school (OR = 1.32, CI: 0.96–1.81), high SES (OR = 1.43, CI: 0.95–2.14), psychological stress (OR = 1.97, CI: 1.42–2.73) and obesity (OR = 6.98, CI: 3.75–12.98). Conclusions: Health education on healthy diet consumption and physical activity, BMI calculation and tracking of blood pressure should be integrated into school health programs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stimulating at the right time to recover network states in a model of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

Synchronization of neural oscillations is thought to facilitate communication in the brain. Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) can result in synaptic reorganization of the motor circuit, leading to altered neuronal dynamics and impaired neural communication. Treatments for PD aim to restore network function via pharmacological means such as dopamine replacement, or by suppressing pathological oscillations with deep brain stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that brain stimulation can operate beyond a simple “reversible lesion” effect to augment network communication. Specifically, we examined the modulation of beta band (14–30 Hz) activity, a known biomarker of motor deficits and potential control signal for stimulation in Parkinson’s. To do this we setup a neural mass model of population activity within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuit with parameters that were constrained to yield spectral features comparable to those in experimental Parkinsonism. We modulated the connectivity of two major pathways known to be disrupted in PD and constructed statistical summaries of the spectra and functional connectivity of the resulting spontaneous activity. These were then used to assess the network-wide outcomes of closed-loop stimulation delivered to motor cortex and phase locked to subthalamic beta activity. Our results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of beta synchrony is dependent upon the strength of inputs to the STN. Precisely timed stimulation has the capacity to recover network states, with stimulation phase inducing activity with distinct spectral and spatial properties. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design of the next-generation brain stimulators that aim to restore neural communication in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global dynamics of microbial communities emerge from local interaction rules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon van Vliet, Christoph Hauert, Kyle Fridberg, Martin Ackermann, Alma Dal Co</p>

Most microbes live in spatially structured communities (e.g., biofilms) in which they interact with their neighbors through the local exchange of diffusible molecules. To understand the functioning of these communities, it is essential to uncover how these local interactions shape community-level properties, such as the community composition, spatial arrangement, and growth rate. Here, we present a mathematical framework to derive community-level properties from the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-cell interactions for systems consisting of two cell types. Our framework consists of two parts: a biophysical model to derive the local interaction rules (i.e. interaction range and strength) from the molecular parameters underlying the cell-cell interactions and a graph based model to derive the equilibrium properties of the community (i.e. composition, spatial arrangement, and growth rate) from these local interaction rules. Our framework shows that key molecular parameters underlying the cell-cell interactions (e.g., the uptake and leakage rates of molecules) determine community-level properties. We apply our model to mutualistic cross-feeding communities and show that spatial structure can be detrimental for these communities. Moreover, our model can qualitatively recapitulate the properties of an experimental microbial community. Our framework can be extended to a variety of systems of two interacting cell types, within and beyond the microbial world, and contributes to our understanding of how community-level properties emerge from microscopic interactions between cells.

                Possession of a firearm without a certified valid license is against Nepalese law. Following a decade-long civil war, Nepal government issued stringent laws not allowing public to possess firearms without a valid reason, despite bearing a license. However, there are people who possess and use firearms for hunting purposes. The present case reports an accidental death of a teenage boy who used a musket for hunting. The present case highlights the fact that despite these stringent laws, illegal possession of arms for trophy hunting is still prevalent in rural Nepal. Furthermore, this study aims to highlight the importance of paramedics in early intervention, stabilization and transport of the sick and injured to the hospital in emergency situations. Also, recruitment of paramedics in the ambulance service might have prevented untimely death in this particular case.

                Background: Monetary and other incentives may increase recruitment to randomised controlled trials. Methods: 2x2 factorial ‘study within a trial’ of including a pen and/or £5 (GBP) in cash with a postal recruitment pack to increase the number of participants randomised into the host trial (‘Gentle Years Yoga’) for older adults with multimorbidity. Secondary outcomes: return, and time to return, of screening form, and the cost per additional participant randomised. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results: 818 potential host trial participants were included. Between those sent a pen (n=409) and not sent a pen (n=409), there was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants randomised (15 (3.7%) versus 11 (2.7%); OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.63–3.04), in returning a screening form (66 (16.1%) versus 61 (14.9%); OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75–1.61) nor in time to return the screening form (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.77–1.55). Between those sent £5 (n=409) and not sent £5 (n=409), there was no evidence of increased randomisation (14 (3.4%) versus 12 (2.9%); OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.54–2.57), but more screening forms were returned (77 (18.8%) versus 50 (12.2%); OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.13–2.45) and there was decreased time to return screening form (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.09–2.22). No significant interaction between the interventions was observed. The cost per additional participant randomised was £32 and £1000 for the pen and £5, respectively. Conclusion: A small, monetary incentive did not result in more participants being randomised into the host trial but did encourage increased and faster response to the recruitment invitation. Since it is relatively costly, we do not recommend this intervention for use to increase recruitment in this population. Pens were cheaper but did not provide evidence of benefit.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A predictive model for daily cumulative COVID-19 cases in Ghana [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected the daily life, governments and economies of many countries all over the globe. Ghana is currently experiencing a surge in the number of cases with a corresponding increase in the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. The surge in cases and deaths clearly shows that the preventive and management measures are ineffective and that policy makers lack a complete understanding of the dynamics of the disease. Most of the deaths in Ghana are due to lack of adequate health equipment and facilities for managing the disease. Knowledge of the number of cases in advance would aid policy makers in allocating sufficient resources for the effective management of the cases. Methods: A predictive tool is necessary for the effective management and prevention of cases. This study presents a predictive tool that has the ability to accurately forecast the number of cumulative cases. The study applied polynomial and spline models on the COVID-19 data for Ghana, to develop a generalized additive model (GAM) that accurately captures the growth pattern of the cumulative cases. Results: The spline model and the GAM provide accurate forecast values. Conclusion: Cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Ghana are expected to continue to increase if appropriate preventive measures are not enforced. Vaccination against the virus is ongoing in Ghana, thus, future research would consider evaluating the impact of the vaccine.

                Background: Excessive trace element exposure has been linked to a variety of harmful health impacts. The goal of this study was to track the amounts of several trace elements in boneless whole chicken samples collected from various shops in Amman, Jordan. Methods: Using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), 30 samples were collected and examined for aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chrome (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). The calculated health risk in Jordanians was based on the measured concentrations of these elements. Results: The element concentrations were such that Fe > Zn > Al > Mn > Cu > Cr > As > Pb > Cd > Hg, with As, Cu, Mn, and Zn exceeding the maximum allowable levels. The combined THQs for these trace elements, on the other hand, were 25.22, a value > 1, indicating a non-carcinogenic effects in adult population. As, Cd, and Cr had cancer risk factors that were 46.80, 8.81, and 41.42 times higher than the acceptable lifetime carcinogenic risk (10-5), respectively. Conclusions: Current research shows that Jordanian consumers are at risk of eating boneless whole chicken.

Based on a significant association between the gray matter volume loss and lower olfactory-specific quality of life, we assume that these morphometric network changes may be closely related to emotional dysfunctions in anosmia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, frequently accompanies emotional dysfunctions, partly due to the overlapping brain regions between the olfactory and emotional processing centers. Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.</p>

                Sustained exposure to a young systemic environment rejuvenates aged organisms and promotes cellular function. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of tissues it remains challenging to pinpoint niche-independent effects of circulating factors on specific cell populations. Here we describe a method for the encapsulation of human and mouse skeletal muscle progenitors in diffusible polyethersulfone hollow fiber capsules that can be used to profile systemic aging <i>in vivo</i> independent of heterogeneous short-range tissue interactions. We observed that circulating long-range signaling factors in the old systemic environment lead to an activation of Myc and E2F transcription factors, induce senescence and suppress myogenic differentiation. Importantly, <i>in vitro </i>profiling using young and old serum in 2D culture does not capture all pathways deregulated in encapsulated cells in aged mice. Thus, <i>in vivo</i> transcriptomic profiling using cell encapsulation allows for the characterization of effector pathways of systemic aging with unparalleled accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The TRRAP transcription cofactor represses interferon-stimulated genes in colorectal cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Transcription is essential for cells to respond to signaling cues and involves factors with multiple distinct activities. One such factor, TRRAP, functions as part of two large complexes, SAGA and TIP60, which have crucial roles during transcription activation. Structurally, TRRAP belongs to the PIKK family but is the only member classified as a pseudokinase. Recent studies established that a dedicated HSP90 co-chaperone, the TTT complex, is essential for PIKK stabilization and activity. Here, using endogenous auxin-inducible degron alleles, we show that the TTT subunit TELO2 promotes TRRAP assembly into SAGA and TIP60 in human colorectal cancer cells (CRC). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TELO2 contributes to TRRAP regulatory roles in CRC cells, most notably of MYC target genes. Surprisingly, TELO2 and TRRAP depletion also induced the expression of type I interferon genes. Using a combination of nascent RNA, antibody-targeted chromatin profiling (CUT&amp;RUN), ChIP, and kinetic analyses, we propose a model by which TRRAP directly represses the transcription of <i>IRF9</i>, which encodes a master regulator of interferon stimulated genes. We have therefore uncovered an unexpected transcriptional repressor role for TRRAP, which we propose contributes to its tumorigenic activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assembly of recombinant tau into filaments identical to those of Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Abundant filamentous inclusions of tau are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively termed tauopathies. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of tau amyloid filaments from human brain revealed that distinct tau folds characterise many different diseases. A lack of laboratory-based model systems to generate these structures has hampered efforts to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underlie tauopathies. Here, we report <i>in vitro </i>assembly conditions with recombinant tau that replicate the structures of filaments from both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as determined by cryo-EM. Our results suggest that post-translational modifications of tau modulate filament assembly, and that previously observed additional densities in AD and CTE filaments may arise from the presence of inorganic salts, like phosphates and sodium chloride. <i>In vitro </i>assembly of tau into disease-relevant filaments will facilitate studies to determine their roles in different diseases, as well as the development of compounds that specifically bind to these structures or prevent their formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Detection of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis using aneuploidy and mutation identification in plasma</a></h4>

              
                Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are the deadliest cancer that arises in individuals diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and account for nearly 5% of the 15,000 soft tissue sarcomas diagnosed in the United States each year. Comprised of neoplastic Schwann cells, primary risk factors for developing MPNST include existing plexiform neurofibromas (PN), prior radiotherapy treatment, and expansive germline mutations involving the entire <i>NF1</i> gene and surrounding genes. PN develop in nearly 30-50% of patients with NF1 and most often grow rapidly in the first decade of life. One of the most important aspects of clinical care for NF1 patients is monitoring PN for signs of malignant transformation to MPNST that occurs in 10-15% of patients. We perform aneuploidy analysis on ctDNA from 883 ostensibly healthy individuals and 28 patients with neurofibromas, including 7 patients with benign neurofibroma, 9 patients with PN and 12 patients with MPNST. Overall sensitivity for detecting MPNST using genome wide aneuploidy scoring was 33%, and analysis of sub-chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) improved sensitivity to 50% while retaining a high specificity of 97%. In addition, we performed mutation analysis on plasma cfDNA for a subset of patients and identified mutations in <i>NF1</i>, <i>NF2</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>TP53BP2</i>, and <i>GOLGA2</i>. Given the high throughput and relatively low sequencing coverage required by our assay, liquid biopsy represents a promising technology to identify incipient MPNST.

                Failures of neural tube closure are common and serious birth defects, yet we have a poor understanding of the interaction of genetics and cell biology during neural tube closure. Additionally, mutations that cause neural tube defects (NTDs) tend to affect anterior or posterior regions of the neural tube but rarely both, indicating a regional specificity to NTD genetics. To better understand the regional specificity of cell behaviors during neural tube closure, we analyzed the dynamic localization of actin and N-cadherin via high-resolution tissue-level time-lapse microscopy during <i>Xenopus</i> neural tube closure. To investigate the regionality of gene function, we generated mosaic mutations in <i>shroom3</i>, a key regulator or neural tube closure. This new analytical approach elucidates several differences between cell behaviors during cranial/anterior and spinal/posterior neural tube closure, provides mechanistic insight into the function of <i>shroom3 </i>and demonstrates the ability of tissue-level imaging and analysis to generate cell-biological mechanistic insights into neural tube closure.

                The establishment of pregnancy in human necessitates appropriate decidualization of stromal cells, which involves steroids regulated periodic transformation of endometrial stromal cells during menstrual cycle. However, the potential molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the initiation and maintenance of decidualization in humans is yet to be fully elucidated. In this investigation, we document that SOX4 is a key regulator of human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) decidualization by directly regulating FOXO1 expression as revealed by whole genomic binding of SOX4 assay and RNA-Seq. Besides, our immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry results unravel that SOX4 modulates progesterone receptor (PGR) stability through repressing E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4 mediated degradation. More importantly, we provide evidence that dysregulated SOX4-HERC4-PGR axis is a potential cause of defective decidualization and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in IVF patients. In summary, this study evidences that SOX4 is a new and critical regulator for human endometrial decidualization, and provides insightful information for the pathology of decidualization-related infertility and will pave the way for pregnancy improvement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular assays identify barriers impeding iron-sulfur enzyme activity in a non-native prokaryotic host</a></h4>

              
                Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ancient and ubiquitous protein cofactors and play irreplaceable roles in many metabolic and regulatory processes. Fe-S clusters are built and distributed to Fe-S enzymes by dedicated protein networks. The core components of these networks are widely conserved and highly versatile. However, Fe-S proteins and enzymes are often inactive outside their native host species. We sought to systematically investigate the compatibility of Fe-S networks with non-native Fe-S enzymes. By using collections of Fe-S enzyme orthologs representative of the entire range of prokaryotic diversity, we uncovered a striking correlation between phylogenetic distance and probability of functional expression. Moreover, coexpression of a heterologous Fe-S biogenesis pathway increases the phylogenetic range of orthologs that can be supported by the foreign host. We also find that Fe-S enzymes that require specific electron carrier proteins are rarely functionally expressed unless their taxon-specific reducing partners are identified and co-expressed. We demonstrate how these principles can be applied to improve the activity of a radical <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine(rSAM) enzyme from a <i>Streptomyces</i> antibiotic biosynthesis pathway in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Our results clarify how oxygen sensitivity and incompatibilities with foreign Fe-S and electron transfer networks each impede heterologous activity. In particular, identifying compatible electron transfer proteins and heterologous Fe-S biogenesis pathways may prove essential for engineering functional Fe-S enzyme-dependent pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural dynamics determine voltage and pH gating in human voltage-gated proton channel</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated ion channels are key players of electrical signaling in cells. As a unique subfamily, voltage-gated proton (Hv) channels are standalone voltage sensors without separate ion conductive pores. Hv channels are gated by both voltage and transmembrane proton gradient (i.e ∆pH), serving as acid extruders in most cells. Amongst their many functions, Hv channels are known for regulating the intracellular pH of human spermatozoa and compensating for the charge and pH imbalances caused by NADPH oxidases in phagocytes. Like the canonical voltage sensors, Hv channels are a bundle of 4 helices (named S1 through S4), with the S4 segment carrying 3 positively charged Arg residues. Extensive structural and electrophysiological studies on voltage-gated ion channels, in general, agree on an outwards movement of the S4 segment upon activating voltage, but the real-time conformational transitions are still unattainable. With purified human voltage-gated proton (hHv1) channels reconstituted in liposomes, we have examined its conformational dynamics, including the S4 segment at different voltage and pHs using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Here, we provide the first glimpse of real-time conformational trajectories of the hHv1 voltage sensor and show that both voltage and pH gradient shift the conformational dynamics of the S4 segment to control channel gating. Our results indicate that the S4 segment transits among 3 major conformational states and kinetic analysis suggest that only the transitions between the inward and outward conformations are highly dependent on voltage and pH changes. Our smFRET studies uncover the stochastic conformational dynamics of S4 and demonstrate how voltage and pH shift its conformational distributions to regulate channel gating. Altogether, we propose a kinetic model that explains the mechanisms underlying voltage and pH gating in Hv channels, which may also serve as a general framework for understanding the voltage sensing and gating in other voltage-gated ion channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fracture healing is delayed in the absence of gasdermin - interleukin-1 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Amino-terminal fragments from proteolytically cleaved gasdermins (GSDMs) form plasma membrane pores that enable the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Excessive GSDM-mediated pore formation can compromise the integrity of the plasma membrane thereby causing the lytic inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis. We found that GSDMD and GSDME were the only GSDMs that were readily expressed in bone microenvironment. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that GSDMD and GSDME are implicated in fracture healing owing to their role in the obligatory inflammatory response following injury. We found that bone callus volume and biomechanical properties of injured bones were significantly reduced in mice lacking either GSDM compared with wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that fracture healing was compromised in mutant mice. However, compound loss of GSDMD and GSDME did not exacerbate the outcomes, suggesting shared actions of both GSDMs in fracture healing. Mechanistically, bone injury induced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion <i>in vivo</i>, a response that was mimicked <i>in vitro</i> by bone debris and ATP, which function as inflammatory danger signals. Importantly, the secretion of these cytokines was attenuated in conditions of GSDMD deficiency. Finally, deletion of IL-1 receptor reproduced the phenotype of <i>Gsdmd</i> or <i>Gsdme</i> deficient mice, implying that inflammatory responses induced by the GSDM-IL-1 axis promote bone healing after fracture.

                Stereopsis is traditionally measured with noise-based stereo tests while the observer views the test in primary gaze. We investigated the effect of stimulus sparseness and axial variations of interocular disparity induced via head rotations. First, we measured stereoacuity using a 4-Alternative-Forced-Choice (4-AFC) task with three uncrossed and one crossed disparity bandpass-filtered circles on a passive-3-D-monitor. Ten binocularly-normal adults fixated a central cross and clicked on the circle withcrossed disparity for forty trials/condition. Observers adopted head tilts of 0{degrees} or {+/-}20{degrees} pitch, roll, or yaw, enforced with an innertial measurement unit and fixation enforced with an eye tracker. Next, we measured stereoacuity in 8 adults while either the head (H), monitor (M), or both (B) were tilted 0{degrees}, {+/-}22.5{degrees}, or {+/-}45{degrees} roll in random order (eighty trials/condition) using a 4-AFC task and random-dot stimuli. Head tilts did not signifcantly alter stereoacuity using narrow-band stimuli(p>0.05), despite that IPDs and the axis of disparity were differentially affected by the tilts. However, for random dot stimuli, stereoacuity decreased with increasing orientation difference between the head and monitor (H and M: p<0.05; B: p>0.05].  Head tilt decreases IPD and rotates the axis of interocular disparity, however, these manipulations affect stereoacuity when measured with noise stimuli but not with sparse stimuli. The results are consistent with a vestibular input to stereoscopic disparity processing that can be detected by sparse stimuli but is masked by dense stimuli. The results have implications for natural vision and for clinical screening in patients with abnormal head posture.

                The ability to sense Earth's gravitational pull is essential for orientation, navigation, and proprioception in most organisms. Here, we demonstrate that C. elegans adults and dauers exhibit negative gravitaxis and that this behavior is modulated by other environmental inputs such as light and electromagnetic fields. We found that components of the DEG/ENaC pathway involved in gentle touch sensation - specifically the neuronally-enriched microtubule subunits MEC-7 and MEC-12, but not the related MEC-4 and MEC-10 mechanosensory subunits - are required for negative gravitaxis. In addition, we found that TRPA-1, a receptor protein associated with cold and mechanosensation in both mammals and invertebrates, is critical for this behavior. Finally, we show that PVD neurons, which utilize TRPA-1 to detect harsh cold, are also essential for gravity sensation. Conversely, TRNs are not required for this behavior. These findings implicate a complex, interconnected mechanism for gravity sensation involving an ion channel that is also present in the mammalian vestibular system.

                Background and Objectives: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is a well-defined developmental disorder characterized by failed neuronal migration, which forms ectopic neuronal nodules along the ventricular walls. Previous studies mainly focus on clinical symptoms caused by the PVNH tissue, such as seizures. However, little is known about whether and how neurons in the PVNH tissue functionally communicate with neurons in the neocortex. Methods: To probe this, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings to patients with PVNH during resting and task states. Results: By estimating frequency-resolved phase coupling strength of the source-reconstructed neural activities, we found that the PVNH tissue was spontaneously coupled with the neocortex in the  to {beta} frequency range, which was consistent with the synchronization pattern within the neocortical network. Furthermore, the coupling strength between PVNH and sensory areas effectively modulated the local neural activity in sensory areas. In both MEG and sEEG visual experiments, the PVNH tissue exhibited visual evoked responses, with a similar pattern and latency as the ipsilateral visual cortex. Discussion: These findings demonstrate that PVNH is functionally integrated into cognition-related cortical circuits, suggesting a co-development perspective of ectopic neurons after their migration failure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic causal modelling shows a prominent role of local inhibition in alpha power modulation in higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                During resting-state EEG recordings, alpha activity is more prominent over the posterior cortex in eyes-closed (EC) conditions compared to eyes-open (EO). In this study, we characterized the difference in spectra between EO and EC conditions using dynamic causal modelling. Specifically, we investigated the role of intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity--within the visual cortex--in generating EC-EO alpha power differences over posterior electrodes. The primary visual cortex (V1) and the bilateral middle temporal visual areas (V5) were equipped with bidirectional extrinsic connections using a canonical microcircuit. The states of four intrinsically coupled subpopulations--within each occipital source--were also modelled. Using Bayesian model selection, we tested whether modulations of the intrinsic connections in V1, V5 or extrinsic connections (or a combination thereof) provided the best evidence for the data. In addition, using parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we estimated group averages under the winning model. Bayesian model selection showed that the winning model contained both extrinsic connectivity modulations, as well as intrinsic connectivity modulations in all sources. The PEB analysis revealed increased extrinsic connectivity during EC. Overall, we found a reduction in the inhibitory intrinsic connections during EC. The results suggest that the intrinsic modulations in V5 played the most important role in producing EC-EO alpha differences, suggesting an intrinsic disinhibition in higher order visual cortex, during EC resting state.

                The human brain can infer temporal regularities across cardiac and auditory inputs. Here, we investigated whether cardio-audio regularity processing occurs during sleep, when the balance between bodily and environmental stimulus processing may be altered. Using electroencephalography and electrocardiography in healthy volunteers (N=26) during wakefulness and sleep, we measured the response to unexpected sound omissions within three regularity conditions: synchronous, where sound and heartbeat are temporally coupled, isochronous, with fixed sound-to-sound intervals, and a third control condition without specific regularity. The synchronous and isochronous sequences induced a modulation of the omission-evoked neural response in wakefulness and N2 sleep, the latter accompanied by a reorganization of the background oscillatory activity. Cardio-audio regularity encoding was further demonstrated by a heartbeat deceleration upon omissions in all vigilance states, higher in the synchronous compared to the other regularity types. The human brain processes cardio-audio temporal relationships to predict future auditory events across distinct vigilance stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesoscale corticocortical connectivity corresponds with intracortical microstimulation-evoked neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cortical stimulation has been a versatile technique for examining the structure and function of cortical regions as well as for implementing novel therapies. While stimulation has been used to examine the local spread of neural activity, it may also enable longitudinal examination of mesoscale interregional connectivity. Recent studies have used focal intracortical microstimulation with optical imaging to show cross-region spread of neural activity, but the exact neural mechanisms elucidated by these modalities is uncertain. Objective: Here, we sought to use intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with recordings of multi-unit action potentials to assess the mesoscale effective connectivity within sensorimotor cortex. Methods: Neural recordings were made from multielectrode arrays placed into sensory, motor, and premotor regions during surgical experiments in three squirrel monkeys. During each recording, single-pulse ICMS was repeatably delivered to a single region. Mesoscale effective connectivity was calculated from ICMS-evoked changes in multi-unit firing. Results: Multi-unit action potentials were able to be detected on the order of 1 ms after each ICMS pulse. Across sensorimotor regions, short-latency (<2.5 ms) ICMS-evoked neural activity strongly correlated with known anatomic connections. Additionally, ICMS-evoked responses remained stable across the experimental period, in spite of small changes in electrode locations and anesthetic state. Conclusions: These results show that monitoring ICMS-evoked neural activity is a viable way to longitudinally assess effective connectivity, enabling studies comparing the time course of connectivity changes with the time course of changes in behavioral function.

                In neurons, many membrane proteins, synthesized in cell bodies, must be efficiently delivered to axons to influence neuronal connectivity, synaptic communication, and repair. Previously, we found that axonal targeting of TrkA neurotrophin receptors in sympathetic neurons occurs via an atypical transport mechanism called transcytosis, which relies on TrkA interactions with PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Here, we generated TrkAR685A mice, where TrkA receptor signaling is preserved, but its PTP1B-dependent transcytosis is disrupted, to show that this mode of axonal transport is essential for sympathetic neuron development and autonomic function. TrkAR685A mice have decreased axonal TrkA levels in vivo, developmental loss of sympathetic neurons, and reduced innervation of targets. Postnatal TrkAR685A mice exhibit reduced pupil size and eyelid ptosis, indicative of sympathetic dysfunction. These findings establish the necessity of transcytosis in supplying TrkA receptors to sympathetic axons and highlight the physiological relevance of this axon targeting mechanism in the nervous system.

                A learned sensory-motor behavior engages multiple brain regions, including the neocortex and the basal ganglia. How these brain regions coordinate to affect sensory selection (for target stimuli) and inhibition (for distractor stimuli) remains unknown. Here, we performed laminar electrophysiological recordings and muscimol inactivation in frontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum to determine the representations within and functions of each region during selective detection performance. From the recording experiments, in deep layers of frontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum we observed similar encoding of sensory and motor features. However, muscimol inactivation of each region resulted in drastically different outcomes. Inactivation of target-aligned striatum substantially reduced behavioral responses to all task stimuli without disrupting the ability to respond, suggesting essential roles in sensory selection. In contrast, inactivation of distractor-aligned frontal cortex increased responses to distractor stimuli, indicating essential roles in distractor inhibition. Overall, these data suggest distinct functions of frontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum in this task, despite having similar neuronal representations.

                Our daily behaviour requires a flexible arbitration between actions we do out of habit and actions that are directed towards a specific goal. Drugs that target opioid and dopamine receptors are notorious for inducing maladaptive habitual drug consumption, yet how the opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems contribute to the arbitration between habitual and goal-directed behaviour is poorly understood. By combining pharmacological challenges with a well-established decision-making task and a novel computational model, we show that the administration of the D2 dopamine receptor antagonist amisulpride led to an increase in goal-directed or "model-based" relative to habitual or "model-free" behaviour, whereas the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone had no appreciable effect. These findings highlight the distinct functional contributions of dopamine and opioid receptors to goal-directed and habitual behaviour and support the notion that D2 receptor antagonists promote stabilisation of goal-relevant information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrastructural analysis of wildtype and RIM1α knock-out active zones in a large cortical synapse</a></h4>

              
                Rab3A-interacting molecule (RIM) is crucial for fast Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle (SV) release in presynaptic active zones (AZ). While loss of RIM1 impairs long-term plasticity at hippocampal giant mossy fiber boutons (MFB), it remains unclear how AZ ultrastructure is altered. We investigated MFB AZ architecture in 3D using electron tomography of rapid cryo-immobilized acute brain slices in RIM1-/- and wild-type mice. In RIM1-/-, AZs are larger with increased synaptic cleft heights and with a three-fold reduced number of tightly docked SVs (0-2nm). The distance of tightly docked SVs to the AZ center is increased from 110 to 195 nm, and the width of their electron dense material between outer SV membrane and AZ membrane is reduced. Furthermore, the SV pool in RIM1-/- is more heterogeneous. Thus, RIM1, beside its role in tight SV docking, is crucial for synaptic architecture and vesicle pool organization in MFBs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced childhood social attention in an autism model marmoset predicts impaired social skills and inflexible behavior in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and communication impairments and restricted and repetitive behavior. Although currently no established cure exists for ASD, early intervention to the deficits of attention to other individuals is expected to reduce the progression of ASD symptoms in later life. In order to confirm this hypothesis and improve early therapeutic interventions, it is desirable to develop an animal model of ASD in which social attention is impaired in childhood and ASD-like social behavior is observed in adulthood. However, rodent models of ASD have difficulty in recapitulating the deficit of gaze-based social attention. In this study, we examined the direction of gaze towards other conspecifics during childhood and puberty in a three-chamber test setting using an ASD model of marmoset produced by maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). We also conducted a reversal learning test in an adult VPA-exposed marmoset as an indicator of perseveration, a core symptom of ASD that has not previously been investigated in this model. The results showed that time spent gazing at other conspecifics was reduced in VPA-exposed marmosets in childhood, and adults displayed rigidity of response. In a longitudinal study using the same animals, deficits in social attention in childhood correlated well with ASD-like social disturbance (inequity aversion and third-party reciprocity) and inflexible behavior in adulthood. Since VPA-exposed marmosets exhibit these diverse ASD-like behaviors that are coherent from childhood to adulthood, VPA-exposed marmosets will provide a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms for early intervention and contribute to the development of early therapies.

                Leading theories of consciousness make diverging predictions for where and how neural activity gives rise to subjective experience. The Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW) states that consciousness is instantiated through global broadcasting of information across the prefrontal-parietal regions, whereas the integrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness requires the posterior cortex to produce maximally irreducible integrated information. As both theories seem to partially agree on that the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) require globally integrated brain activity across a network of functionally specialized modules, it is not known yet whether brain regions with such functional configurations would align with the NCC distribution predicted by the GNW or the IIT. We scanned resting-state fMRI data from 21 subjects during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation and anesthesia. Graph-theoretical analysis were conducted on awake fMRI data to search for the NCC candidates as brain regions that exhibit both high rich-clubness and high modular variability. Another independent dataset of 10 highly-sampled subjects were used to validate the NCC distribution at individual-level. Brain module-based dynamic analysis was conducted to estimate temporal stability of the NCC candidates. Alterations in functional connectivity and modular variability from awake to propofol-induced anesthesia were assessed to test the involvement of the NCC candidates in conscious processing. NCC candidates that are characterized by both high functional interconnectivity and high modular variability were identified to locate in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices, which covered brain structures predicted by the GNW as well as the IIT. The identified NCC was found to mainly attributed to higher-order cognitive functions, and associated with genes enriched in synaptic transmission. Dynamic analysis revealed two discrete reoccurring brain states, which were characterized by their difference in temporal stability, that is the state dominated by the NCC candidates appearred to be temporally more stable than the other state predominately composed of primary sensory/motor regions, suggesting that the identified NCC members could sustain conscious contents as metastable network representations. Finally, we showed that the prefrontal GNW regions and posterior IIT regions within the identified NCC was differentially modulated in terms of functional connectedness and modular variability in response to loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia. This work offers a framework to search for neural correlates of consciousness by charting the brain network topology, and provides new insights in understanding the distinct roles of the frontoparietal and posterior network in underpinning human consciousness.

                {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptors that incorporate 5 subunits (5-GABAARs) are highly enriched in the hippocampus and they are strongly implicated in the control of learning and memory. Receptors located on pyramidal neuron dendrites have long been considered responsible, but here we report that selective elimination of 5-GABAARs from either interneurons or pyramidal cells prevented the general anesthetic etomidate from suppressing contextual learning. Using Ca2+ imaging of hippocampal neuronal activity in freely exploring mice, we also found that etomidate interfered with the development of place cells and spatial engrams in wild type mice but not in interneuron-specific 5-GABAAR knockout mice. These findings show that 5-GABAARs on interneurons as well as pyramidal neurons mediate etomidate-induced amnesia.

                The need for reproducible, credible, multiscale biological modeling has led to the development of standardized simulation platforms, such as the widely-used NEURON environment for computational neuroscience. Developing and maintaining NEURON over several decades has required attention to the competing needs of backwards compatibility, evolving computer architectures, the addition of new scales and physical processes, accessibility to new users, and efficiency and flexibility for specialists. In order to meet these challenges, we have now substantially modernized NEURON, providing continuous integration, an improved build system and release workflow, and better documentation. With the help of a new source-to-source compiler of the NMODL domain-specific language we have enhanced NEURON's ability to run efficiently, via the CoreNEURON simulation engine, on a variety of hardware platforms, including GPUs. Through the implementation of an optimized in-memory transfer mechanism this performance optimized backend is made easily accessible to users, providing training and model-development paths from laptop to workstation to supercomputer and cloud platform. Similarly, we have been able to accelerate NEURON's reaction-diffusion simulation performance through the use of just-in-time compilation. We show that these efforts have led to a growing developer base, a simpler and more robust software distribution, a wider range of supported computer architectures, a better integration of NEURON with other scientific workflows, and substantially improved performance for the simulation of biophysical and biochemical models.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which the mechanisms underlying its core symptomatology are largely unknown. Studying animal models of monogenic syndromes associated with ASD, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can offer insights into its aetiology. Here, we show that loss of function of the Drosophila NF1 ortholog results in larval tactile hypersensitivity, paralleling the sensory abnormalities observed in individuals with ASD. Mutant larvae also exhibit synaptic transmission deficits at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ), with increased spontaneous but reduced evoked release. Diminished expression of NF1 specifically within central cholinergic neurons induces both excessive neuronal firing and tactile hypersensitivity, suggesting the two may be linked. Furthermore, both impaired synaptic transmission and behavioural deficits are fully rescued via knockdown of Ras proteins. These findings validate NF1-/- Drosophila as a tractable model of ASD with the potential to elucidate important pathophysiological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What the flip? What the P-N flip can tell us about proactive suppression</a></h4>

              
                It has been debated whether salient distractors in visual search can be proactively suppressed to completely prevent attentional capture, as the occurrence of proactive suppression implies that the initial shift of attention is not entirely driven by physical salience. While the presence of a Pd component in the EEG (associated with suppression) without a preceding N2pc component (associated with selection) has been used as evidence for proactive suppression, the link between these ERPs and the underlying mechanisms is not always clear. This is exemplified in two recent papers that observed the same waveform pattern, where an early Pd-like component flipped to a N2pc-like component, but provided very different interpretations (Drisdelle & Eimer, Psychophysiology, 58(9), 1-12, 2021; Kerzel & Burra, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 32(6), 1170-1183, 2020). Using RAGNAROC (Wyble et al., Psychological Review, 127(6), 1163-1198, 2020), a computational model of reflexive attention, we successfully simulated this ERP pattern with minimal changes to its existing architecture, providing a parsimonious and mechanistic explanation for this flip in the EEG that is unique from both of the previous interpretations. Our account supports the occurrence of proactive suppression and demonstrates the benefits of incorporating computational modelling into theory building.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The tail domain of neurofilament light chain accumulates in neuronal nuclei during oxidative injury</a></h4>

              
                Neurofilament light chain (NFL), one of the major subunits of neuron-specific intermediate filaments, is an important component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Mutations in the NEFL gene and disturbances of NFL turnover or transport are associated with the pathophysiology of various diseases of the nervous system. Also, NFL is released from neurons as a result of neuroaxonal damage and NFL levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood have emerged as a biomarker of the progression of numerous neurological diseases. One common underlying factor in these diseases is oxidative stress. Although both NFL and oxidative injury play a role in the development of neurological diseases, the effect of oxidative stress on NFL at the cellular level has not been extensively studied. Here, by investigating the response of neurofilaments to in vitro oxidative injury, we discovered that NFL localizes in the nuclei of primary neurons. We show that this depends on calpain activity and determine that a proteolytic fragment of the tail domain, not the full-length NFL, is that which accumulates in the nuclei. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recombinant NFL tail domain accumulates in the nuclei of neurons and neuroblastoma cells, even in the absence of oxidative injury. Finally, we show that the tail domain of NFL interacts with the DNA in the nuclei of living cells, suggesting that NFL plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in response to oxidative injury.

                Maternal immune activation (MIA) is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing mental illness in adulthood, which often co-occurs with alcohol misuse. The current study aimed to begin to determine whether MIA, combined with adolescent alcohol exposure (AE), could be used as a model with which we could study the neurobiological mechanisms behind such co-occurring disorders. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with PolyI:C or saline on gestational day 15. Half of the offspring were given continuous access to alcohol during adolescence, leading to four experimental groups: controls, MIA, AE, and Dual (MIA + AE). We then evaluated whether MIA and/or AE alters: 1) alcohol consumption; and 2) cortical-striatal-hippocampal oscillations in adult offspring. Dual rats, particularly females, drank significantly more alcohol in adulthood compared to all other groups. Using machine learning to build predictive models from oscillations, we were able to differentiate Dual rats from control rats and AE rats in both sexes, and Dual rats from MIA rats in females. The current data suggest that MIA+AE (Dual hits) is a valuable model that we can use to study the neurobiological underpinnings of co-occurring disorders. Our future work aims to extend these findings to other addictive substances to enhance the translational relevance of this model.

                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly regulates the exchange of ions and molecules between the blood and the central nervous system. The tight junctions (TJs) are multimeric structures that control the transport through the paracellular spaces between adjacent brain endothelial cells of the BBB. Claudin-5 (Cldn5) proteins are essential for the TJ formation. They assemble into multi-protein complexes via cis- interactions within the same cell membrane, and trans-interactions across two contiguous cells. Despite the barrier function of Cldn5 proteins and their role as targets of brain drug delivery strategies, the molecular details of their assembly within TJs are still unclear. Two different structural models have been recently introduced, in which Cldn5 dimers belonging to opposite cells join together to generate paracellular pores. However, a comparison of these models in terms of ionic transport features is still lacking. In this work, we used extended molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to assess the two Cldn5 pore models and investigate the thermodynamic properties of water and physiological ions permeation through them. Despite different FE profiles, both structures present single or multiple FE barriers to ionic permeation, while being permissive to water flux. These results reveal that both models are compatible with the physiological role of Cldn5 TJ strands. By identifying the protein-protein surface at the core of TJ Cldn5 assemblies, our computational investigation provides a basis for the rational design of synthetic peptides and other molecules capable of opening paracellular pores in the BBB.

Here, we report that Emx1-Cre is expressed in nodose ganglion cells whose axon travel within afferent vagal nerves and terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a critical central autonomic regulatory pathway located in the dorsal medulla. Optogenetic stimulation of Emx1-Cre+ fibers reliably evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in the NTS in vitro and evoked a parasympathetic bradycardia reflex occasionally with irregular respirations in anesthetized mice in vivo. Our study clearly demonstrates that Emx1-IRES-Cre is expressed in the vagal nerve fibers traveling within the central autonomic system involving autonomic cardiorespiratory regulation. These results raise caution when interpreting the systemic phenotypes of Emx1-IRES-Cre conditional recombinant mice, and also suggest the utility of this line to investigate the modulators of afferent vagal system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The predictive power of mRNA mapping for Cannabinoid 1 receptor protein in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor is expressed in cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Recently, with the help of the Allen Human Brain Atlas, genomic maps visualize not only the gene expression across whole brain regions, but also the functional profile of brain structures. Therefore, it is more timely than ever to integrate genomic mapping from brain mRNA atlas with the protein expression from positron emission tomography (PET) scans for better understanding of CB1 receptor of the human brain. F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans were retrieved from the AIVO neuroinformatics project. Autoradiography data were based on the study with H3-CP55940. mRNA expressions of CNR1 gene (Cannabinoid receptor 1) were downloaded from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Volume of distribution (VT) from F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans, CNR1 gene expression, and H3-CP55940 binding were calculated and Spearman correlation analysis was performed. Also, a meta-analysis was done to investigate the association between protein expression from PET and mRNA expression from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Between VT of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA expression, moderate strength of correlation was observed (rho = 0.5026, p = 0.0354). Strong positive correlation was also found between CNR1 mRNA expression and H3-CP55940 binding (rho = 0.6727, p = 0.0281), validating the finding between F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA. From the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient ranged from -0.46 to 0.99, with a pooled effect of 0.58. In conclusion, the moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain were observed that CNR1 mRNA mapping might have the predictive power for in vivo CB1 receptor protein expression. From the meta-analysis, the moderate to strong correlation was observed between mRNA expression and protein expressions across multiple genes, showing the predictive power of genes to estimate protein levels of human brains.

                Nogo-A protein is a key myelin-associated inhibitor for axonal growth, regeneration, and plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Regulation of the Nogo-A/NgR1 pathway facilitates functional recovery and neural repair after spinal cord trauma and ischemic stroke. MicroRNAs are described as effective tools for the regulation of important processes in CNS such as neuronal differentiation, neuritogenesis, and plasticity. Our results showed that miR-182-5p mimic specifically downregulates the expression of the luciferase reporter gene fused to the mouse Nogo-A 3'UTR, and Nogo-A protein expression in Neuro-2a and C6 cells. Finally, we observed that when rat primary hippocampal neurons are co-cultured with C6 cells transfected with miR-182-5p mimic, there is a promotion of the outgrowth of neuronal neurites in length. From all these data we suggest that miR-182-5p may be a potential therapeutic tool for the promotion of axonal regeneration in different diseases of the CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simulating semantic dementia in a brain-constrained model of action and object words learning</a></h4>

              
                The nature of semantic knowledge - conceptual information stored in the brain - is highly debated in the field of cognitive science. Experimental and clinical data specify various cortical regions involved in the processing of meaning. Those include semantic hubs that take part in semantic processing in general as well as sensorimotor areas that process specific conceptual categories according to their modality. Biologically inspired neurocomputational models can help adjudicate between different theories about the exact roles of those regions in the functioning of the semantic system. Here, we used an existing neuroanatomically constrained model of frontotemporal brain areas implicated in language acquisition and grounding and adapted it to replicate and explain the effects of semantic dementia (SD) on word processing abilities. SD is a disease characterized by semantic knowledge deterioration that correlates with neural damage in the anterior temporal lobe. The behavior of our model is in accordance with clinical data - namely, word recognition performance decreases as SD lesions progress, whereas word repetition abilities remain preserved, or are less affected. Furthermore, our model makes novel predictions about category-specific effects of SD - namely, our simulation results indicate that word processing should be more impaired for object- than for action-related words, and that white matter degradation should lead to more severe consequences than the same proportion of grey matter degradation. The present results provide a mechanistic, cortical-level explanatory account of a range of language impairments as observed in clinical populations during the onset and progress of semantic dementia.

                This study aimed to investigate whether instrumental reward learning is affected by the cardiac cycle. To this end, we examined the effects of the cardiac cycle (systole or diastole) on the computational processes underlying the participants' choices in the instrumental learning task. In the instrumental learning task, participants were required to select one of two discriminative stimuli (neutral visual stimuli) and immediately receive reward/punishment feedback depending on the probability assigned to the chosen stimuli. To manipulate the cardiac cycle, the presentation of discriminative stimuli was timed to coincide with either cardiac systole or diastole. We fitted the participants' choices in the task with reinforcement learning (RL) models and estimated parameters involving instrumental learning (i.e., learning rate and inverse temperature) separately in the systole and diastole trials. Model-based analysis revealed that the learning rate for positive prediction errors was higher than that for negative prediction errors in the systole trials; however, learning rates did not differ between positive and negative prediction errors in the diastole trials. These results demonstrate that the natural fluctuation of cardiac afferent signals can affect asymmetric value updating in instrumental reward learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibition is a prevalent mode of activity in the neocortex around awake hippocampal ripples</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated peri-ripple activity in the hippocampal-neocortical network is essential for mnemonic information processing in the brain. Hippocampal ripples likely serve different functions in sleep and awake states. Thus, the corresponding neocortical activity patterns may differ in important ways. We addressed this possibility by conducting voltage and glutamate wide-field imaging of the neocortex with concurrent hippocampal electrophysiology in awake mice. Contrary to our previously published sleep results, deactivation and activation were dominant in post-ripple neocortical voltage and glutamate activity, respectively, especially in the agranular retrosplenial cortex (aRSC). Additionally, the spiking activity of aRSC neurons, estimated by two-photon calcium imaging, revealed the existence of two subpopulations of excitatory neurons with opposite peri-ripple modulation patterns: one increases and the other decreases firing rate. These differences in peri-ripple spatiotemporal patterns of neocortical activity in sleep versus awake states might underlie the reported differences in the function of sleep versus awake ripples.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Arrayed Genome-Wide Perturbation Screen Identifies the Ribonucleoprotein hnRNP K As Rate-Limiting for Prion Propagation</a></h4>

              
                A defining characteristic of mammalian prions is their capacity for self-sustained propagation. Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence suggest that prion propagation is modulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous modifiers. Using a novel quantitative phospholipase protection assay (QUIPPER) for high-throughput prion measurements, we performed an arrayed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen aimed at detecting modifiers of prion propagation. We exposed prion-infected cells in high-density microplates to 35.364 ternary pools of 52.746 siRNAs targeting 17.582 genes representing the mouse protein-coding transcriptome. We identified 1191 modulators of prion propagation. While 1151 of these modified the expression of both the pathological prion protein, PrPSc, and its cellular counterpart PrPC, 40 genes affected selectively PrPSc. Of the latter, 20 genes augmented prion production when suppressed. A prominent limiter of prion propagation was the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Hnrnpk. Psammaplysene A (PSA), which binds Hnrnpk, reduced prion levels in cultured cells and protected them from cytotoxicity. PSA also reduced prion levels in infected cerebellar organotypic slices and alleviated locomotor deficits in prion-infected Drosophila melanogaster expressing ovine PrPC. Hence, genome-wide QUIPPER-based perturbations can discover actionable cellular pathways involved in prion propagation. Finally, the unexpected identification of a prion-controlling ribonucleoprotein suggests a role for RNA in the generation of infectious prions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An innovative hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy approach benefits CLN1 disease in the mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can lead to the establishment of a long-lasting microglia-like progeny in the brain of properly myeloablated hosts. We exploited this approach to treat the severe CLN1 neurodegenerative disorder, which is the most aggressive form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, due to deficiency of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (hPPT1). We here provide first evidence that: i) transplantation of wild type HSPCs exerts a partial but long-lasting mitigation of the symptoms; ii) transplantation of HSPCs over-expressing hPPT1 by lentiviral gene transfer enhances therapeutic benefit as compared to wild type cell transplant, with first demonstration of such a dose-effect benefit for a purely neurodegenerative condition like CLN1 disease; iii) transplantation of hPPT1 over-expressing HSPCs by a novel intracerebroventricular (ICV) approach is sufficient to transiently ameliorate CLN1 disease symptomatology in the absence of hematopoietic tissue engraftment of the transduced cells; and iv) the combinatorial transplantation of transduced HSPCs intravenously and ICV results in the most robust therapeutic benefit among the tested approaches on both pre-symptomatic as well as symptomatic animals. Overall, these findings provide first evidence of the efficacy and feasibility of this novel approach to treat CLN1 disease and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions, paving the way for its future clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG Responses to Auditory Figure-Ground Perception</a></h4>

              
                Speech-in-noise difficulty is commonly reported among hearing-impaired individuals. Recent work has established generic behavioural measures of sound segregation and grouping that are related to speech-in-noise processing but do not require language. In this study, we assessed potential clinical electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of central auditory grouping (stochastic figure-ground test) and speech-in-noise perception (speech-in-babble test) with and without relevant tasks. Auditory targets were presented within background noise (16 talker-babble or randomly generated pure-tones) in 50% of the trials and composed either a figure (pure-tone frequency chords repeating over time) or speech (English names). EEG was recorded while participants were presented with the target stimuli (figure or speech) under different attentional states (relevant task or visual-distractor task). EEG time-domain analysis demonstrated enhanced negative responses during detection of both types of auditory targets within the time window 650-850 ms but only figure detection produced significantly enhanced responses under the distracted condition. Further single-channel analysis showed that simple vertex-to-mastoid acquisition defines a very similar response to more complex arrays based on multiple channels. Evoked-potentials to the generic figure-ground task therefore represent a potential clinical measure of grouping relevant to real-world listening that can be assessed irrespective of language knowledge and expertise even without a relevant task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent TMS-fMRI to determine adaptive brain changes to virtual lesions interfering with visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Understanding the causal relationship between a focal lesion and brain network (re)organization is a crucial step in order to accurately predict the resulting symptoms of the lesion and implement personalized rehabilitation strategies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to create local and transient neural perturbations, the so-called virtual lesion approach. In this study, we tested how a virtual lesion applied to the Early Visual Areas (EVA) or the extrastriate, motion-sensitive, medio-temporal area (hMT+/V5) in different contexts affects behavior and changes neuronal network activity and organisation, assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: We applied short trains of 10 Hz TMS to healthy participants over the EVA or hMT+/MT. This was done both at rest and at relevant times during a motion discrimination task, while concurrent fMRI was performed. Regional BOLD activity was analysed using a general linear model (GLM) and functional brain networks were assessed using independent component analysis (ICA). Motion direction discrimination and motion awareness were related to the imaging data. Results: TMS applied over the EVA and hMT+/V5 induced transient modulation of motion perception and discrimination. Comparing resting versus active states, both TMS sites showed a common suppression of local and remote brain activity at rest while an over-activation of the stimulated areas and related networks were found during the task. More subtly, distinct dynamic and topological TMS-induced networks properties could be revealed depending on the exact visual processing stages TMS was applied at. In particular, brain networks associated with EVA stimulation showed a clear context-dependency and were spatially more restricted than for hMT+/V5 stimulation. Discussion: The present findings highlight the possibility of interfering with distinct visual processing stages and the possibility of imaging the local and remote neural correlates of the behavioral impact. They also confirm the complexity of TMS effects on BOLD activity, switching from signal suppression at rest to irrelevant neural noise addition during active visual processing, even differing throughout the time course of information processing. Moreover, the networks analyses suggest that the EVA might be more resilient to focal perturbations by means of a virtual lesion than hMT+/V5. As a critical processing center, the EVA may be important for maintaining stability in the visual network, whereas the perturbation of a more specialized region such as hMT+/V5 has greater impact on local and network activity, as well as on behavior. These findings add to the understanding of visual motion processing and especially to the impact and potential mechanism of focal lesions in this system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subgroups of eating behavior traits independent of obesity defined using functional connectivity and feature representation learning</a></h4>

              
                Eating behavior is highly heterogeneous across individuals, and thus, it cannot be fully explained using only the degree of obesity. We utilized unsupervised machine learning and functional connectivity measures to explore the heterogeneity of eating behaviors. This study was conducted on 424 healthy adults. We generated low-dimensional representations of functional connectivity defined using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and calculated latent features using the feature representation capabilities of an autoencoder by nonlinearly compressing the functional connectivity information. The clustering approaches applied to latent features identified three distinct subgroups. The subgroups exhibited different disinhibition and hunger traits; however, their body mass indices were comparable. The model interpretation technique of integrated gradients revealed that these distinctions were associated with the functional reorganization in higher-order associations and limbic networks and reward-related subcortical structures. The cognitive decoding analysis revealed that these systems are associated with reward- and emotion-related systems. We replicated our findings using an independent dataset, thereby suggesting generalizability. Our findings provide insights into the macroscopic brain organization of eating behavior-related subgroups independent of obesity.

	<p>Perturbations in dopamine system function may increase risk of substance use disorder (SUD). We recently demonstrated that neuromelanin (NM) MRI signal in the substantia nigra, a non-invasive index of dopamine system function, is elevated in long term cocaine users (Cassidy et al., 2020). However, it is unclear whether elevated NM-MRI signal is linked to risk of SUD, or is a byproduct of long-term drug use. Our prior work failed to show relations between NM-MRI signal and functional engagement of ventral striatum during a monetary reward task. However, social experiences are commonly linked to drug use and relapse. Given that, NM-MRI signal may be more closely linked to ventral striatal engagement during social, rather than monetary reward processing. Emerging adults (n = 33, 21.88 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.35 years) with varying levels of substance abuse, but without SUD, underwent NM-MRI and fMRI during social and monetary reward processing tasks. Voxelwise analysis within the substantia nigra (SN) demonstrated lower NM-MRI signal was associated with more severe substance abuse. Lower right ventral striatal engagement to social reward was also associated with more severe substance abuse. This relation was moderated by SN NM-MRI signal such that diminished striatal response to reward was associated with greater substance abuse among those with low NM-MRI signal, but lower substance abuse among those with high NM-MRI signal. Unexpectedly, higher right ventral striatal engagement during monetary reward was associated with more severe substance abuse. This relation was moderated by SN NM-MRI signal such that greater striatal response to reward was associated with greater substance abuse among those with low NM-MRI signal. Taken together, we provide preliminary evidence that, in emerging adults, low rather than high dopamine system function may increase risk of substance abuse, and strengthen the association between substance use and the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensitivity to social and monetary outcomes in different ways.</p>

	<p>Deficits in the executive control of attention greatly impact the quality of life of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, attentional deficits are often underemphasized in clinical contexts compared with mood-based symptoms, and a comprehensive approach for specifically evaluating and treating them has yet to be developed. The present study evaluates the efficacy of bifrontal electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with drug therapy (DT) in alleviating mood-related symptomatology and executive control deficits in drug-refractory MDD patients and compares these effects with those observed in MDD patients undergoing DT only. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Lateralized Attentional Network Test-Revised were administered across two test sessions to assess treatment-related changes in mood-based symptoms and conflict processing, respectively, in patients undergoing ECT + DT (n = 23), patients undergoing DT (n = 33), and healthy controls (n = 40). Although both groups showed an improvement in mood-based symptoms following treatment and a deficit in conflict processing estimated on error rate, a post-treatment reduction of an executive control deficit estimated on RT was solely observed in the ECT + DT patient group. Furthermore, Bayesian correlational analyses confirmed the dissociation of mood-related symptoms and of executive control measures, supporting existing literature proposing that attentional deficits and mood symptoms are independent aspects of MDD. The cognitive profile of MDD includes executive control deficits, and while both treatments improved mood-based symptoms, only ECT + DT exerted an effect on both measures of the executive control deficit. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the improvement in both mood and cognitive deficits when determining the efficacy of therapeutic approaches for MDD.</p>

	<p>Striatal dopamine dysfunction is associated with the altered top-down modulation of pain processing. The dopamine D2-like receptor family is a potential substrate for such effects due to its primary expression in the striatum, but evidence for this is currently lacking. Here, we investigated the effect of pharmacologically manipulating striatal dopamine D2 receptor activity on the anticipation and perception of acute pain stimuli in humans. Participants received visual cues that induced either certain or uncertain anticipation of two pain intensity levels delivered via a CO2 laser. Rating of the pain intensity and unpleasantness was recorded. Brain activity was recorded with EEG and analysed via source localisation to investigate neural activity during the anticipation and receipt of pain. Participants completed the experiment under three conditions, control (Sodium Chloride), D2 receptor agonist (Cabergoline), and D2 receptor antagonist (Amisulpride), in a repeated-measures, triple-crossover, double-blind study. The antagonist reduced an individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to distinguish between low and high pain following uncertain anticipation. The EEG source localisation showed that the agonist and antagonist reduced neural activations in specific brain regions associated with the sensory integration of salient stimuli during the anticipation and receipt of pain. During anticipation, the agonist reduced activity in the right mid-temporal region and the right angular gyrus, whilst the antagonist reduced activity within the right postcentral, right mid-temporal, and right inferior parietal regions. In comparison to control, the antagonist reduced activity within the insula during the receipt of pain, a key structure involved in the integration of the sensory and affective aspects of pain. Pain sensitivity and unpleasantness were not changed by D2R modulation. Our results support the notion that D2 receptor neurotransmission has a role in the top-down modulation of pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Contributions of Distinct Auditory Cortical Inhibitory Neuron Types to the Detection of Sounds in Background Noise</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to separate background noise from relevant acoustic signals is essential for appropriate sound-driven behavior in natural environments. Examples of this separation are apparent in the auditory system, where neural responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli become increasingly noise invariant along the ascending auditory pathway. However, the mechanisms that underlie this reduction in responses to background noise are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we first evaluated the effects of auditory cortical inactivation on mice of both sexes trained to perform a simple auditory signal-in-noise detection task and found that outputs from the auditory cortex are important for the detection of auditory stimuli in noisy environments. Next, we evaluated the contributions of the two most common cortical inhibitory cell types, parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, to the perception of masked auditory stimuli. We found that inactivation of either PV<sup>+</sup> or SOM<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in a reduction in the ability of mice to determine the presence of auditory stimuli masked by noise. These results indicate that a disruption of auditory cortical network dynamics by either of these two types of inhibitory cells is sufficient to impair the ability to separate acoustic signals from noise.</p>
