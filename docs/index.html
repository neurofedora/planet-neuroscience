                Background Smart home-enabled smart cities require low-latency data processing, precise energy forecasting, and strong risk prediction to guarantee efficient energy use and secure system functionality. Traditional cloud-centric IoT architectures face issues such as high latency, excessive energy consumption, and limited real-time threat detection. To tackle these problems, this research presents a fog-cloud-IoT-based framework aimed at improving energy efficiency, security, and operational reliability within smart home settings. Methods This study introduces a Cost-Effective Risk Prediction and Energy Management in Fog-Cloud-IoT (CREFCI) model. The architecture employs a Raspberry Pi 4 fog node for local data processing and communication, tracks user preferences and device statuses locally, ensures network security through Suricata IDS/IPS, and keeps a synchronized duplicate database in the IoT cloud for analytics and user interaction via Android and Web APIs. Interoperability among Zig bee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi protocols is facilitated through JSON/XML data transformation, energy demand is predicted using ANN-based learning, and risk scores are calculated through likelihood-impact analysis. Results Experimental assessments reveal that the CREFCI model achieves 75% accuracy in energy prediction, surpassing existing models by 13% for the highest predictions and doubling accuracy for the third-highest probability estimates. The model decreases mean absolute error (MAE) by 50% and enhances accuracy in lower-ranked predictions by 40–44%. Energy consumption is significantly lowered by 50–80%, using only 0.3–0.5 kWh compared to 1.0–1.7 kWh in competing methods. Furthermore, average latency is reduced by 40–60%, underscoring the effectiveness of fog-based processing. Conclusions The CREFCI model successfully integrates fog computing, cloud analytics, ensemble learning, and risk assessment to improve energy efficiency, prediction accuracy, and security in smart home IoT systems. By reducing latency reducing energy consumption, and providing real-time risk prediction, CREFCI offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for next-generation fog–cloud–IoT smart city infrastructures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-292/v1?src=rss">EffiRadNet: Lightweight and User-Friendly Open-Source EfficientNet-Based Model for Radiology Image Binary Classification Tasks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives To develop and evaluate EffiRadNet, a lightweight, user-friendly, open-source image classification model based on EfficientNet-B0, tailored for simple binary classification tasks in radiology, involving visually distinct image. The model aims to provide high accuracy and usability while remaining computationally efficient and accessible to non-engineering users. Methods EffiRadNet was trained and validated on three task-specific, class-balanced datasets (200 training and 200 validation images per dataset) sourced from the Open Access Biomedical Image Search Engine. The three classification tasks included a “Medical” task distinguishing radiological from non-radiological medical images, a “Modality” task classifying X-rays versus other radological modalities, and a “X-rays” task differentiating chest X-rays from other anatomical X-rays. The model used transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned with a modified two-class output layer. Performance was assessed across different hyperparameter settings using AUC, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Results EffiRadNet achieved strong classification performance across all tasks, with AUC values up to 1.0 under optimal hyperparameters (≥≤30 epochs, batch size = 16, learning rate = 0.0001). The “Medical” and “X-rays” models showed balanced sensitivity and specificity, while the “Modality” model displayed high sensitivity but variable specificity depending on hyperparameters. Training times ranged from 11 to 12 minutes, inference took less than 30 seconds per dataset. Conclusion EffiRadNet is a fast, accurate, and accessible AI tool for binary classification of radiological images. Its open-source availability and minimal hardware requirements make it well-suited for tasks such as image modality classification, dataset preprocessing, and quality control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-291/v1?src=rss">Diagnostic Accuracy of PET Imaging for Lymph Node Detection in Breast cancer patients undergoing Upfront Surgery: A Single-Institution Analysis of Breast Cancer Patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The role of PET imaging in lymph node staging for breast cancer patients proceeding to upfront surgery remains incompletely characterized. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PET imaging in immediate surgical patients. Methods A retrospective cohort of 70 breast cancer patients undergoing upfront surgery was analyzed. PET imaging findings were compared with histopathological examination (HPE) results. Diagnostic accuracy metrics including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results Among 70 surgical patients (mean age 53.9 ± 11.5 years), 26 (37.14%) had pathologically confirmed lymph node involvement. PET imaging demonstrated sensitivity of 69.23% (95% CI: 48.27-85.67), specificity of 81.82% (95% CI: 67.27-91.60), PPV of 69.23%, and NPV of 81.82%. The test correctly identified 18 of 26 patients with nodal disease while avoiding false positives in 36 of 44 node-negative patients. Positive likelihood ratio was 3.81, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.38. The F1-score was 0.6923, indicating good balance between precision and sensitivity for surgical planning. Conclusions PET imaging demonstrates clinically meaningful sensitivity (69.23%) and high negative predictive value (81.82%) in upfront surgical patients, supporting its utility for identifying patients with nodal involvement and confidently excluding nodal disease when negative. These performance characteristics suggest that PET can inform surgical extent and staging accuracy in immediate surgical patients, though positive findings warrant confirmatory assessment when staging determines operative planning.

                The propagation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare, while remote monitoring has enabled and patient care has improved, significant vulnerabilities have introduced that threaten the security of sensitive medical data. To address this crucial challenge, the study proposes a novel framework to enhance the privacy of data and trustworthiness in healthcare IoT ecosystems using advanced anomaly detection. We introduced a Customized Sand Cat Swarm driven Updated Random Forest (CSCS-URF) model, as a first step, data is preprocessed using min-max normalization and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The Second step is analyzing data by an ensemble classifier optimized via a customized swarm intelligence algorithm to effectively identify security anomalies. Then, evaluate the system on the CICIoT20232 dataset, the proposed CSCS-URF method shows superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, achieving an accuracy of 97%, precision of 94%, recall of 96%, and an F1-score of 95%. These results indicate that the CSCS-URF framework is a robust solution for proactive security, enabling the early detection of potential breaches to strengthen system integrity and safeguard patient data against evolving cyber threats in the healthcare sector.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection. As an institutional case study, this report is intended to illustrate operational strategy within a defined governance and infrastructure environment rather than to function as a universally prescriptive implementation model.

                Background The global aging population worldwide has led to increased attention toward ensuring a good quality of life (QoL) among older adults, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities. This study aimed to identify the determinants of quality of life among older adults living in a social care center in West Jakarta. Method This quantitative study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design involving 288 participants from a social care center. Data were collected using structured questionnaires measuring sleep behavior, medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, physical activity, and quality of life. Results The results indicated that sleep behavior was significantly associated with QoL (p = 0.002), whereas no statistically significant associations were found between QoL and other variables, including medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, and physical activity. Conclusion Sleep behaviour was identified as a significant association of QoL among institutionalized individuals. These findings suggest that sleep-focused approach should be prioritized in care strategies to improve the quality of life of older adults in long-term care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-289/v1?src=rss">Are the goals for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar S.M.A.R.T. and meaningful? A retrospective analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Goal setting is a foundational element of pediatric rehabilitation, guiding therapeutic planning, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhancing clinical outcomes. For children with neuromotor disabilities, goals must be both technically sound and personally meaningful—reflecting family priorities and child-centered values. The SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) is widely adopted to improve goal clarity and therapeutic effectiveness, while the F-words for Child Development framework (Function, Family, Fitness, Fun, Friends, Future) emphasizes contexts meaningful for the children and their families. Studies on goal analysis of children with neuromotor disabilities from Qatar is very limited. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the quality and meaningfulness of physical therapy goals set for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar, using both the SMART elements and the F-words for Child Development framework. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at the largest pediatric outpatient physical therapy department in Qatar. Electronic medical records from January to December 2019 were reviewed. A purposive sample of 100 children (between 12 months and 14 years) with neuromotor conditions—including cerebral palsy, developmental delay, Down syndrome, and genetic/metabolic disorders—was selected. A total of 183 goals from 92 children were finally analyzed. Each goal was mapped to identify its alignment with both the S.M.A.R.T and F-words framework. Results Overall adherence to SMART elements was high, particularly for goals that were specific, measurable, achievable, and time-bound. Goals mapped to the Relevant element were inconsistent, possibly reflecting limited family engagement in the goal-setting process. All goals aligned with at least one F-words domain, with Function being the most frequently represented. Domains such as Family, Fun, Fitness, Friends, and Future were notably underutilized. Conclusion While physical therapy goals for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar demonstrate strong technical structure, their meaningfulness from a family-centered perspective remains suboptimal. Strengthening family engagement and broadening the application of F-words during the goal-setting process are essential to enhancing family-centered care for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar.

                Context The human endonuclease Artemis, required for immunoglobulin rearrangements of V(D)J segments in B cells and thereby contributing to the adaptive immune response, belongs to the metallo-β-lactamase enzyme superfamily. β-lactam antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, are widely used in clinical practice and display strong affinity for β-lactamase catalytic sites. In vitro, ceftriaxone has been shown to block the activity of Artemis. Based on these structural similarities, the hypothesis according to which certain β-lactams could inhibit Artemis and therefore the immune response was previously proposed by our teams. This study aimed to determine in vivo whether ceftriaxone exposure alters vaccine-induced humoral immunity. Methods To explore the hypothesis put forward above, we developed an animal model to evaluate the antibody immune response to tetanus toxin induced by a diphtheria–tetanus–poliomyelelitis (DTP) vaccine in the presence or absence of ceftriaxone. Male BALB/c mice were vaccinated either before or after a five-day intraperitoneal ceftriaxone treatment; control groups received isotonic saline. The mice immune response to vaccine was quantified by measuring interactions with specific antigens using immunochromatographic tests, enabling longitudinal assessment of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies. Results We report the first experimental evidence of a specific weakening of vaccine-induced immune response in animals receiving ceftriaxone, with significantly reduced anti-tetanus antibody levels when vaccination followed antibiotic exposure. The response remained efficient in animals receiving isotonic saline treatment as control, and in mice vaccinated prior to ceftriaxone administration. Conclusions These results confirm our hypothesis that the immune response to tetanus toxin is impaired and that a refractory period for humoral immunity may be caused by the inhibition of Artemis by ceftriaxone. This work highlights a clinically relevant interaction between β-lactam antibiotics and adaptive immune responses.

                Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant comorbidity in cardiovascular treatments, increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Choosing between drug-eluting balloons (DEB) and drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with CKD requires careful consideration of efficacy and safety. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of DEB and DES in CKD patients, focusing on mortality, MACE, TLR, and stent thrombosis. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort study comparing DEB and DES in CKD patients were included. Four reviewers independently screened and extracted data on mortality, MACE, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and stent thrombosis, and conflicts were resolved through discussion. Results Five studies (four retrospective cohorts, one RCT) met inclusion criteria after screening 4,093 records, involving CKD/ESRD patients undergoing PCI with DEB (paclitaxel-coated) versus contemporary DES. MACE rates were equivalent: 17% in both arms (Funayama et al., ESRD dialysis cohort) and 10% in both arms (Jeger et al., RCT; HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.38-2.57). Target lesion revascularization (TLR) and target vessel failure (TVF) showed heterogeneity: DES favored in some (e.g., Waha et al., aHR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.69), DEB numerically in others (e.g., Joh et al., 2-year TVF 14.3% DEB vs. 27.8% DES), with no meta-analysis due to clinical/methodological differences; thrombosis was low and sparse (0% DEB vs. 2.2% DES in Funayama). Conclusion In CKD/ESRD patients, DEB and DES yield equivalent MACE, though TLR/TVF results vary by study design, CKD severity, and procedural factors. No clear superiority emerged, supporting individualized strategy selection based on lesion characteristics, bleeding risk, and expertise. Prospective RCTs with standardized CKD subgroups and DEB optimization are needed for definitive guidance. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD420251039001 (05/15/2025)

                Abstract* The forecast of time series in financial applications is difficult to perform as time series forecasting is nonlinear in nature, seasonal, and has structural variability. Stock price series tend to follow a lot of nonlinear dynamics, which undermines the power of single-model approaches. Hybrid decomposition-based models have attracted increasing interest in order to gain accuracy by separating heterogeneous features from one another. In this work, we present a hybrid forecasting methodology that incorporates STD decomposition with RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network). The time series is decomposed, where trend, seasonal, and dispersion components are separately modeled using RBFNN with Gaussian basis functions. The predicted feature sets are then recombined to construct a forecast, to be evaluated with weekly Tesla stock price data and standard accuracy performance metrics. The STD–RBFNN model gives very low forecasting errors under different variables and a high coefficient of determination. It shows superiority compared with an alternative hybrid neural network model, especially in modeling nonlinear variation under similar experimental conditions. This results in substantially greater forecasting accuracy because trend, seasonal, and dispersion components separate before neural modeling. The proposed STD and RBFNN pipeline is a good and highly flexible method to forecast complex nonlinear and seasonal financial time series.

                arXiv:2602.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synaptic transmission must balance the need for reliable signalling against the metabolic cost of achieving that reliability. How energetic constraints shape synaptic precision and its regulation during plasticity remains unclear. Here we develop an energy--constrained framework in which synapses minimise postsynaptic response variance subject to a fixed mean and an effective energy budget. Combinations of candidate physiological costs are used to estimate an energy cost for synaptic transmission; this cost is then inferred from quantal statistics. Analysing five published pre- and post-plasticity datasets, we find that observed synaptic mean--variance pairs cluster near a minimal-energy boundary, indicating that precision is limited by energetic availability. Model comparison identifies a dominant calcium pump-like cost paired with a smaller vesicle turnover-like cost, yielding a separable precision--energy relationship, $\sigma^{-2} \propto E^5$. We further show that plasticity systematically updates synaptic energy budgets according to the scale-free magnitude of mean change, enabling accurate prediction of post-plasticity variance from energy allocation alone. These results provide direct experimental support for the hypothesis that synaptic precision is governed by energy budgets, establishing energy allocation as a fundamental principle linking metabolic constraints, synaptic reliability, and plasticity.

                arXiv:2602.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive systems must strike a balance between prediction and surprise to thrive in uncertain environments. We propose an information-theoretic balance function, $ f(p) = -(1 - p)\ln(1 - p) + \ln p $, which quantifies the net informational gain from contrasting explained variance $p$ with unexplained novelty $(1 - p)$. This function is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ and reaches its unique maximum at $ p^* \approx 0.882$, revealing a regime where confidence is high but the residual uncertainty carries a disproportionate potential for surprise.
  Independently of this maximum, imposing a self-similarity condition between known, unknown and total information, $p : (1-p) = 1 : p$, leads to the golden-ratio reciprocal $p = 1/\varphi \approx 0.618$, where $ \varphi$ is the golden ratio. We interpret this value not as the maximizer of $f$, but as a structurally privileged \emph{partition} in which known and unknown are proportionally nested across scales.
  Embedding this dual structure into a Compute-Inference-Model-Action (CIMA) loop yields a dynamic process that maintains the system near a critical regime where prediction and surprise coexist. At this edge, neuronal dynamics exhibit power-law structure and maximal dynamic range, while the system's response to perturbations becomes convex at the level of its payoff function-fulfilling the formal definition of antifragility. We suggest that the golden-ratio partition is not merely a mathematical artifact, but a candidate design principle linking prediction, surprise, criticality, and antifragile adaptation across scales and domains, while the maximum of $f$ identifies the point of greatest informational vulnerability to being wrong.

                arXiv:2503.15130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, popular functional frameworks and neural network formulations operate by making use of extrinsic error measurements and global learning algorithms. Through a set of conjectures based on evolutionary insights on the origin of cellular adaptive mechanisms, we reinterpret the core meaning of sensory signals to allow the brain to be interpreted as a negative feedback control system, and show how this could lead to local learning algorithms without the need for global error correction metrics. Thereby, a sufficiently good minima in sensory activity can be the complete reward signal of the network, as well as being both necessary and sufficient for biological learning to arise. We show that this method of learning was likely already present in the earliest unicellular life forms on earth. We show evidence that the same principle holds and scales to multicellular organisms where it in addition can lead to division of labour between cells. Available evidence shows that the evolution of the nervous system likely was an adaptation to more effectively communicate intercellular signals to support such division of labour. We therefore propose that the same learning principle that evolved already in the earliest unicellular life forms, i.e. negative feedback control of externally and internally generated sensor signals, has simply been scaled up to become a fundament of the learning we see in biological brains today. We illustrate diverse biological settings, from the earliest unicellular organisms to humans, where this operational principle appears to be a plausible interpretation of the meaning of sensor signals in biology, how this relates to current neuroscientific theories and findings, and how it can be applied to solve body control.

                arXiv:2511.21677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both focal inflammation and compartmentalized neurodegeneration, yet the relative effect of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on information processing speed (IPS) remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Results: Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These processing-associated ROIs exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogeneous contributions from focal lesion-driven and chronic neurodegenerative pathology, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.

                arXiv:2602.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tuning of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) involves resolving trade-offs among several competing objectives, including operational safety, system responsiveness, energy usage, and passenger comfort. This work introduces a novel optimization framework based on Quantum-Inspired Hybrid Swarm Intelligence (QiHSI), in which quantum-inspired mechanisms are embedded within a multi-objective salp swarm optimization process to strengthen global search capability and preserve population diversity in complex, high-dimensional decision spaces. In addition, a decision-maker-in-the-loop strategy is incorporated to incorporate adaptive expert guidance, enabling the optimization process to respond dynamically to changing design priorities and system constraints. The effectiveness of QiHSI is assessed using established multi-objective benchmark problems as well as a practical ADAS calibration scenario. Experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art evolutionary and swarm-based algorithms, including MSSA, MOPSO, MOEA/D, SPEA2, NSGA-III, and RVEA, show that the proposed method consistently produces well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions with faster convergence and improved adaptability. These findings demonstrate that QiHSI offers a reliable and scalable approach for intelligent ADAS calibration, supporting the development of more responsive, efficient, and safety-oriented autonomous driving technologies.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel problem, namely the Uncertain Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (UAEOSSP). Unlike the static AEOSSP, it takes into account a range of uncertain factors (e.g., task profit, resource consumption, and task visibility) in order to reflect the reality that the actual information is inherently unknown beforehand. An effective Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) is designed to automate the generation of scheduling policies. The evolved scheduling policies can be utilized to adjust plans in real time and perform exceptionally well. Experimental results demonstrate that evolved scheduling policies significantly outperform both well-designed Look-Ahead Heuristics (LAHs) and Manually Designed Heuristics (MDHs). Specifically, the policies generated by GPHH achieve an average improvement of 5.03% compared to LAHs and 8.14% compared to MDHs.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning in cloud environments requires protecting sensitive data while enabling remote computation. Here we demonstrate the first realistic implementations of a perfectly-secure quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) scheme applied to quantum neural networks (QNN). Using efficient Clifford+$T$ decomposition, we implement quantum convolutional neural networks for two complementary scenarios: (i) reverse delegated training, where encrypted data from multiple providers trains a user's network via federated aggregation; (ii) private inference, where users process encrypted data with remote quantum networks. Moreover, analysis of server circuit privacy reveals probabilistic model protection through Pauli gate concealment. These results establish perfectly-secure QHE as a practical framework for multi-party quantum machine learning.

                arXiv:2602.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable performance in high-dimensional sequential decision-making tasks, yet remains limited by low sample efficiency, sensitivity to noise, and weak generalization under partial observability. Most existing approaches address these issues primarily through optimization strategies, while the role of architectural priors in shaping representation learning and decision dynamics is less explored. Inspired by structural principles of the cerebellum, we propose a biologically grounded RL architecture that incorporate large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation. Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show that both the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation consistently improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization compared to conventional designs. Sensitivity analysis of architectural parameters suggests that cerebellum-inspired structures can offer optimized performance for RL with constrained model parameters. Overall, our work underscores the value of cerebellar structural priors as effective inductive biases for RL.

Abstract: We propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed operator-learning Networks (Morephy-Net) to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) in noisy data regimes, for both forward prediction and inverse identification. Existing physics-informed neural networks and operator-learning models (e.g., DeepONets and Fourier neural operators) often face three coupled challenges: (i) balancing data/operator and physics residual losses, (ii) maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse observations, and (iii) providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Morephy-Net addresses these issues by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization that treats data/operator and physics residual terms as separate objectives and searches the Pareto front, thereby avoiding ad hoc loss weighting; (ii) replica-exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to enhance global exploration and stabilize training in non-convex landscapes; and (iii) Bayesian uncertainty quantification obtained from stochastic sampling. We validate Morephy-Net on representative forward and inverse problems, including the one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion--wave equation. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy, noise robustness, and calibrated uncertainty estimates over standard operator-learning baselines.

Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Iraq. Methods The study included 881 participants with T2DM and different types of foot ulcers, who attended a specialized diabetes center. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, biochemical investigations, comorbidities, and treatment regimens were collected and analyzed. Results The majority of the cases (96.8%) were due to T2DM, with an average age of 58 years and a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2. Participants had elevated serum creatinine, blood urea, and glucose levels, with uncontrolled HbA1c levels. Comorbidities included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetic neuropathy, and retinopathy. Most participants were on insulin and statins. Diabetic foot ulcers were mainly on the right foot (48%) and classified as Grade 2 in Wagner’s system. Some participants had Charcot deformity or stages of amputation. Conclusions Random plasma glucose levels and diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with the classification of foot ulcers. Further research is needed to explore additional variables related to T2DM and foot ulcers, emphasizing the importance of glucose control and retinopathy in ulcer classification.

                Background Infertility has become a significant issue that requires attention as its prevalence has increased globally and nationally in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades. This study aimed to explore patients’ perceptions towards infertility and in vitro fertilization-related services. Additionally, this study examined the barriers that prevent couples from seeking infertility treatment and IVF in Khobar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Methods This study employed a qualitative, hybrid thematic analysis approach. Fifteen participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into three categories: infertility patients, infertility caregivers, and administrative staff working in infertility clinics. Results This study identified four main themes: patients’ experiences, infertility services in Eastern Province, and perceived barriers to receiving treatment. Participants reported that they believed infertility was on the rise, especially male infertility. The reported obstacles included financial burdens, lack of awareness, societal influences, and lengthy, complex treatment processes. Conclusions This study highlights the significant barriers that couples encounter in accessing infertility treatment. These findings emphasize the urgent need for improved public health policies, such as utilizing case management to support patients and incorporating insurance coverage for infertility treatments, along with enhanced support services.

                The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is a pivotal tool for organizing mechanistic knowledge and linking it to adverse outcomes of regulatory significance. However, the integration of test method information, particularly New Approach Methods (NAMs), within the central repository for AOP knowledge, (the AOP-Wiki), has been suboptimal, limiting the framework’s utility for regulatory decision-making. The Methods2AOP collaboration, comprised of various international stakeholders, was established to address this gap and enhance the role of test methods within the AOP framework. This paper reviews their work emphasizing the importance of linking detailed test method information and conceptually proposes how it may be included in the AOP knowledgebase in alignment with existing assay documentation standards and governance frameworks. The Methods2AOP collaboration proposes using ontologies to standardize and structure information, thereby facilitating interoperability, enabling reusability, and establishing clear connections between test methods and Key Events (KEs). A conceptual model is presented to demonstrate qualitative similarities between concepts in key event components and structured methods information. The implementation of Methods2AOP recommendations would increase the clarity and transparency of method descriptions, which could support regulatory acceptance and a wider adoption of NAMs. The broad community of stakeholders impacted by this work stands to benefit from the Methods2AOP recommendations through enhanced regulatory decisions, increased visibility and scientific impact, new market opportunities, and the accelerated adoption of NAMs in regulatory affairs. In summary, the Methods2AOP collaboration presents a comprehensive effort to formally standardize the integration of test methods into the AOP framework, thereby fostering a more robust, and transparent system that aligns with the goals of the scientific and regulatory communities.

                Although chronic stress increases the risk for depression, only a subset of exposed individuals develop psychiatric illness. The biological mechanisms that protect against depression remain incompletely understood, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we identify a transcriptional network in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a central brain reward region, that supports stress resilience in both sexes and demonstrate the causal contribution of key hub genes. Using chronic social defeat stress, RNA-seq, and co-expression network analysis, we find sex-specific but overlapping gene modules linked to resilience, anchored by shared hub genes embedded within a common network architecture. Overexpression of these hub genes in stress-naive mice confers stress protection and induces a transcriptional state that is discrete from both susceptible and resilient profiles. These findings position resilience as a structured and targetable molecular phenotype and provide a basis for investigating sex-informed mechanisms of stress adaptation.

">Hypothalamic asymmetry in hemisphere-specific neuroendocrine signaling</a></h4>

              
                Brain lesions classically cause contralateral sensorimotor and postural deficits, attributed to the decussation of descending neural pathways. However, recent findings reveal that, beyond neural mechanisms, contralateral effects can also be mediated by the neuroendocrine system via humoral pathways. This raises the possibility that the brain regulates left- and right-sided peripheral processes through hypothalamic neurohormones released into the bloodstream. For such spatially targeted endocrine signaling to occur, hemisphere-specific neural activity must be encoded into side-specific hormonal output - requiring a lateralized organization of hypothalamic neuroendocrine systems. Here, we report molecular asymmetries in the rat hypothalamus that support this mechanism. Transcriptomic analysis revealed asymmetric expression of eleven neurohormonal genes, including Gnrh1, Cck, and Trh, along with distinct left-right side-specific gene co-expression networks. Chemogenetic stimulation of Arg-vasopressin neurons in vasopressin-hM3Dq-mCherry transgenic rats produced generalized changes in these networks - predominantly in the right hypothalamus - suggesting that hypothalamic neurohormonal circuits function as integrated, lateralized ensembles. Stereological analysis revealed asymmetric coordination of vasopressin neurons within the paraventricular nucleus, with the left rostral region decoupled from the right rostral and caudal subregions. Functionally, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, cholecystokinin-8, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone - administered intracisternally in rats with complete spinal cord transection - elicited side-specific peripheral responses, measured as hindlimb postural asymmetry in a binary left-right output model. These neurohormonal effects were therefore transmitted via the humoral route. These findings suggest that multiple hypothalamic neurohormones and their integrated networks are asymmetrically organized, and that their lateralization may be necessary for hemisphere-specific hormonal regulation of peripheral systems.

">Cacna1b alternative splicing is linked to associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated CaV2.2 channels are essential for neurotransmitter release throughout the nervous system including areas related to learning and memory like the hippocampus. Previous results have shown that CaV2.2 channels are involved in cognitive processes. However, a link between alternative splicing of the Cacna1b (gene that encodes for CaV2.2) pre-mRNA and cognitive processes has not been described. The Cacna1b pre-mRNA undergoes extensive cell-specific alternative splicing. In this body of work, we focus on the cassette exon 18a. Alternative splicing of exon 18a generates two splice variants, +18a-Cacna1b and {Delta}18a-Cacna1b. Exon 18a encodes a 21-amino acid sequence within the SYNaptic PRotein INTeraction (synprint) site. Splice variants containing exon 18a (+18a-CaV2.2) show reduced cumulative inactivation and increased calcium current density compared to splice variants lacking exon 18a ({Delta}18a-CaV2.2), suggesting functional specialization. We previously showed that +18a-Cacna1b splice variants are enriched in cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK+INs). This neuronal type is strongly implicated in associative learning. Therefore, we tested whether alternative splicing of exon 18a contributes to associative learning. To test this hypothesis, we used genetically engineered mice that constitutively express either +18a-Cacna1b (+18a) or {Delta}18a-Cacna1b ({Delta}18a). We first validated that restricted splicing of exon 18a did not alter downstream alternative or constitutive spliced exons in the Cacna1b pre-mRNA, nor total CaV2.2 protein levels. We then performed a comprehensive behavioral analysis that included assessment of associate learning. We found that in the trace fear conditioning task, +18a mice exhibited less freezing during the trace interval in both the acquisition and memory phases compared to WT mice. Whereas {Delta}18a mice showed enhanced freezing during the same intervals relative to WT mice. These bidirectional phenotypes reveal that exon 18a shapes aversive associative learning. Furthermore, exon 18a splicing did not influence spatial working memory, spatial navigation under stress, nociceptive responses in basal and inflammatory conditions, overall locomotion or exploratory behavior. These results suggest that the behavioral impact of exon 18a splicing is highly selective. Together, our findings identify alternative splicing of exon 18a as a molecular contributor to associative learning.

">Distributed neurophysiological dynamics link perception, action, and language in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is characterized by disturbances in both perception and expression that profoundly impair social functioning, yet these domains are typically studied in isolation. Predictive processing theories suggest that such symptoms may arise from abnormal updating of internal models, but the neural mechanisms linking perceptual and expressive dysfunction remain unclear. Using magnetoencephalography during multisensory perception and motor tasks, we tested whether beta-band activity (15-30 Hz), a neural signal implicated in predictive control, provides a shared substrate across domains. Compared to healthy individuals, patients with schizophrenia showed attenuated event-related modulation of beta activity, including weaker beta suppression during sensory processing and delayed or reduced post-movement beta rebound. These abnormalities were associated with a widened audiovisual temporal binding window, indicating atypical multisensory integration. Multivariate analyses further revealed that reduced beta modulation across sensory and motor systems covaried with impoverished semantic diversity, simplified syntactic structure in natural speech, and greater clinical symptom burden. Notably, beta abnormalities emerged as distributed latent patterns spanning sensory, motor, and frontotemporal regions. Together, these findings identify diminished event-related beta modulation as a common neural signature linking disrupted multisensory integration, action monitoring, and language organization in schizophrenia. We situate perceptual and expressive impairments within a unified framework of predictive dysfunction and advance a mechanistically grounded account that highlights beta dynamics as a promising target for future mechanistic and translational studies in psychosis.

                <p>by David Luis Schultheiss, Zsolt Turi, Joschka Boedecker, Andreas Vlachos</p>

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used non-invasive brain stimulation technique in neuroscience research and clinical applications. TMS-based motor hotspot hunting describes the process of identifying the optimal scalp location to elicit robust and reliable motor responses. It is critical to ensure reproducibility of TMS parameters, as well as to determine safe and precise stimulation intensities in both healthy participants and patients. Typically, this process targets motor responses in contralateral short hand muscles. However, hotspot hunting remains challenging due to the vast parameter space and time constraints. To address this, we present an approach that concurrently optimizes both spatial and angular TMS parameters for hotspot hunting using Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization. We systematically evaluated five state-of-the-art acquisition functions on electromyographic TMS data from eight healthy individuals enhanced by simulated data from generative models. Our results consistently demonstrate that optimizing spatial and angular TMS parameters simultaneously enhances the efficacy and spatial precision of hotspot hunting. Furthermore, we provide mechanistic insights into the acquisition function behavior and the impact of coil rotation constraints, revealing critical limitations in current hotspot-hunting strategies. Specifically, we show that arbitrary constraints on coil rotation angle are suboptimal, as they reduce flexibility and fail to account for individual variability. We further demonstrate that acquisition functions differ in sampling strategies and performance. Functions overly emphasizing exploitation tend to converge prematurely to local optima, whereas those balancing exploration and exploitation—particularly Thompson sampling—achieve superior performance. These findings highlight the importance of acquisition function selection and the necessity of removing restrictive coil rotation constraints for effective hotspot hunting. Our work advances TMS-based hotspot identification, potentially reducing participant burden and improving safety in both research and clinical applications beyond the motor cortex.

                <p>by Hongyi Zhou, Brice Edelman, Jeffrey Skolnick</p>

Although individual Mendelian diseases—those caused by a single gene—are rare, their collective disease burden is substantial. Identifying the causal gene for each condition is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Yet, despite decades of research, the genetic basis of more than half of all known Mendelian diseases remains unresolved. To address this gap, we introduce MENDELSEEK, a machine learning framework that predicts Mendelian genes by integrating residue variation scores with pathway participation, Gene Ontology processes, and protein language model features. In benchmarking across 16,946 human genes with 10-fold cross-validation, MENDELSEEK achieved an AUC of 0.869 and an AUPR of 0.737—substantially outperforming the next best methods, ENTPRISE+ENTPRISE-X (AUC 0.781; AUPR 0.626), and REVEL (AUC 0.585; AUPR 0.401). When applied to the full set of 17,858 human genes, MENDELSEEK predicted 1,277 novel Mendelian gene candidates with precision greater than 0.7. Analysis further revealed that Mendelian genes engage in significantly more protein-protein interactions than non-Mendelian genes and are evolutionarily ancient. Together, these results highlight MENDELSEEK as a major advance over existing methods, offering new insights into the biochemical features that distinguish Mendelian from non-Mendelian genes.

                <p>by C. Edson Utazi, Somnath Chaudhuri, Oghenebrume Wariri, Iyanuloluwa D. Olowe, Mohamed Megheib, Andrew J. Tatem</p>

High-resolution maps of vaccination coverage are valuable for uncovering heterogeneities in coverage to inform vaccine delivery strategies. Coverage maps stratified by age can reveal additional heterogeneities in the timeliness of vaccination and critical immunity gaps among birth cohorts. Here, we propose a spatially varying coefficient model relying on a Bayesian approach for age-structured mapping of vaccination coverage using geolocated individual level household survey and geospatial covariate data. Our flexible modelling framework includes parameterizations capturing spatial (non-)stationarity in differences in coverage between age groups, as well as a modification to allow coverage mapping for singe age points through the inclusion of a smoother over age. The proposed models are fitted using the INLA-SPDE approach implemented in the inlabru package in R. We choose between competing model parameterizations by examining their out-of-sample predictive performance via cross-validation and using Bayesian model choice criteria. The methodology is applied to age-structured mapping of measles vaccination coverage in Cote d’Ivoire using the 2021 Demographic and Health Survey. Our results reveal a significant delay in measles vaccination in the first year of life and substantial spatial differences in coverage by age, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to achieve equity and attain vaccine-derived immunity goals.

                <p>by Runzhi Xie, Junping Li, Yuxuan Hu, Lin Gao</p>

Tumor development and progression are affected not only by cancer cell-intrinsic factors comprising complex genetic variations, but also by -extrinsic factors such as cell-cell communication (CCC)-mediated immunosuppression. However, whether and how these two types of factors influence each other remains an open question. We present Driver2Comm, a general computational framework designed to systematically identify intrinsic-extrinsic (IE) pathways that functionally connect cancer cell driver genes with their associated CCC signatures in the tumor microenvironment (TME). By applying Driver2Comm to single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets of multiple cancer types, we find that driver gene-associated CCC signatures play critical roles in immune regulation, metastasis, and therapy response. These signatures not only illuminate mechanisms of TME remodeling but also demonstrate clinical value in predicting patient survival and response to immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, Driver2Comm captures higher-order, cell-type-pair-specific CCC functional modules and spatially coherent CCC patterns in tissue contexts. As a generalizable tool, Driver2Comm bridges cancer genomics and cellular ecosystems, offering insights into biomarker discovery and combination therapy strategies.

                <p>by Riley J. Arseneau, Leah K. MacLean, Jeanette E. Boudreau, Daniel Gaston</p>

The increasing accessibility of next-generation sequencing has empowered researchers to investigate somatic mutations in cancer. The complexity of variant analysis pipelines, terminology, and tool selection remains a major barrier, especially for those new to the field or working in translational settings. To address this challenge, we present a practical framework that guides researchers through the critical steps of variant interrogation in tumor samples. This guide is broken into four phases: <i>Planning</i>—laying the foundation for thoughtful experimental design and a clear understanding of sequencing outputs; <i>Gathering Resources</i>—assembling the tools, reference data, and variant annotation sets required for analysis; <i>Filtering and Validation</i>—executing a systematic approach to prioritize meaningful variants; and <i>Dissemination and Storage</i>—ensuring findings are reproducible and accessible through transparent reporting and data sharing. Developed with an emphasis on accessibility, reproducibility, and clinical relevance, this framework equips researchers with the guidance to navigate variant analysis with confidence and rigor.

Galaxy is a widely used open-source platform for accessible, reproducible, transparent and scalable data analysis in the life sciences and beyond. Despite its growing adoption across domains, several misconceptions persist about its scope, usability, scalability and relevance to academia and industry. In this manuscript, we identify and address 10 common misconceptions about Galaxy, ranging from the belief that it is limited to genomics, lacks scalability, or is only useful for teaching, to doubts about its ability to support secure data analysis or maintain high software quality as a free and open-source project. We refute each misconception with present evidence based on Galaxy’s technical features, real-world use cases, user communities and governance structures. We show that Galaxy is a mature and versatile platform capable of supporting cutting-edge scientific research, education and even clinical workflows across a wide variety of disciplines. By clarifying existing misconceptions, we aim to help researchers, educators, developers and decision-makers better appreciate Galaxy’s capabilities and potential within their fields.

                <p>by Kristine Heiney, Mónika Józsa, Michael E. Rule, Henning Sprekeler, Stefano Nichele, Timothy O’Leary</p>

In many parts of the brain, population tuning to stimuli and behaviour gradually changes over the course of days to weeks in a phenomenon known as representational drift. The tuning stability of individual cells varies over the population, and it remains unclear what drives this heterogeneity. We investigate how a neuron’s tuning stability relates to its shared variability with other neurons in the population using two published datasets from posterior parietal cortex and visual cortex. We quantified the contribution of pairwise interactions to behaviour or stimulus encoding by partial information decomposition, which breaks down the mutual information between the pairwise neural activity and the external variable into components uniquely provided by each neuron and by their interactions. Information shared by the two neurons is termed ‘redundant’, and information requiring knowledge of the state of both neurons is termed ‘synergistic’. We found that a neuron’s tuning stability is positively correlated with the strength of its average pairwise redundancy with the population. We hypothesize that subpopulations of neurons show greater stability because they are tuned to salient features common across multiple tasks. Regardless of the mechanistic implications of our work, the stability–redundancy relationship may support improved longitudinal neural decoding in technology that has to track population dynamics over time, such as brain–machine interfaces.

RNA structures are essential for understanding their biological functions and developing RNA-targeted therapeutics. However, accurate RNA structure prediction from sequence remains a crucial challenge. We introduce DRfold2, a deep learning framework that integrates a novel pre-trained RNA Composite Language Model (RCLM) with a denoising structure module for end-to-end RNA structure prediction. Based solely on single sequence, DRfold2 achieves superior performance in both global topology and secondary structure predictions over other state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark tests from diverse species. Detailed analyses reveal that the improvements primarily stem from the RCLM’s ability to capture co-evolutionary pattern and the effective denoising process, with a more than 100% increase in contact prediction precision compared to existing methods. Furthermore, DRfold2 demonstrates high complementarity with AlphaFold3, achieving statistically significant accuracy gains when integrated into our optimization framework. By uniquely combining composite language modeling, denoising-based end-to-end learning, and deep learning-guided post-optimization, DRfold2 establishes a distinct direction for advancing ab initio RNA structure prediction.

                Background Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and early losses, affects millions globally. Approximately 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affecting 1-2% of couples. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological, psychological, and assisted reproductive technology (ART) interventions in improving clinical and psychological outcomes for women experiencing pregnancy loss. Objective To assess the impact of pharmacological, psychological, and ART interventions on clinical and psychological outcomes in women experiencing pregnancy loss and identify gaps in healthcare delivery. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, 18 studies published between 2020 and 2024 were analyzed using data from PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Studies were included if they assessed interventions for pregnancy loss, focusing on pharmacological therapies, psychological approaches, and ART. Statistical heterogeneity (I2 statistic) and publication bias (Egger’s regression test) were evaluated. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses explored variations across geographic, demographic, and methodological factors. Results Pharmacological therapies, including mifepristone and misoprostol, significantly improved tissue expulsion (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.8–4.3) and patient satisfaction. Low-dose aspirin increased live birth rates by 22% (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10–1.35). Psychological interventions such as mindfulness and art therapy reduced stress (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.30) and enhanced quality of life. ART interventions, especially immediate frozen embryo transfer (FET), improved clinical pregnancy rates (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.23). Subgroup analyses identified lower intervention efficacy in low-resource settings, while home-based misoprostol showed safety but limited efficacy in reducing postpartum hemorrhage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-283/v1?src=rss">Gamification as an Effective Strategy for Improving Primary School Students' Social Skills [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the effectiveness of gamification in improving the social skills of primary school students. In the educational context, social skills are crucial competencies that support both academic and emotional development. However, many schools still use traditional teaching methods that focus on cognitive aspects and do not provide enough space for meaningful social interactions. This study aims to fill this gap by testing whether gamification can enhance students’ social skills compared to conventional teaching methods. Methods The sample consisted of 30 primary school students from SDN Palumbonsari II, Indonesia and data were collected using a closed questionnaire consisting of 24 items that measure various aspects of social skills. Using an experimental design with pretest and posttest methods. Result The results show that gamification significantly improved students’ social skills scores. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics and a paired t-test, showed a significant increase in social skills scores from 65.50 (SD = 2.675) in the pretest to 81.80 (SD = 3.863) in the posttest. The t-test showed a t-value of -28.514 with a p-value of 0.000 (p < 0.05), indicating a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that gamification creates a more interactive and enjoyable learning environment, enhances student motivation, and improves their social skills. These results are expected to serve as a foundation for developing curricula and teaching practices that support the social and emotional development of students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-282/v1?src=rss">Digitalization of Indonesian SOEs and Employee Mental Health: Mitigating Digital Anxiety in Finance Functions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates factors that mitigate digital anxiety, focusing on organizational climate (digital training, role clarity, teamwork, transformational leadership), regulatory support, and information and communication technology (ICT) skills. Grounded in the Technology-Organization-Environment framework, this research provides a novel contribution by exploring these relationships in the context of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Indonesia. Data were collected through a survey targeting finance department employees in SOEs who utilize digital technology in their daily tasks. A total of 270 valid responses were analyzed using SmartPLS. The findings reveal that organizational climate variables along with regulatory support, significantly reduce digital anxiety. Moreover, ICT skills enhance the negative impact of digital training and teamwork on digital anxiety. However, the moderating role of ICT skills in strengthening the effects of role clarity and transformational leadership on digital anxiety was not supported. The practical implications of this study are significant for SOE management. To foster a supportive organizational climate, managers should ensure clearly defined roles through detailed job descriptions and encourage collaborative teamwork. Such measures can help employees address challenges collectively, thereby alleviating digital anxiety. These insights contribute to both academic literature on workplace digital transformation and managerial strategies for employee well-being.

                Background Peer tutoring, a pedagogical approach in which students assist one another in the learning process, has demonstrated strong educational and psychosocial benefits in health professions education. It enhances cognitive development, communication, self-efficacy, and social connectedness. Within nursing education, peer tutoring encourages reflective learning and professional growth. However, limited research has explored its impact within culturally and linguistically diverse student populations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Aims This study explored the experiences of nursing student tutors and tutees at the University of Sharjah, evaluating their impact on academic development, emotional resilience, interpersonal connections, and the overall learning experience within a culturally and linguistically diverse population. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with a purposive sampling of 20 undergraduate nursing students (6tutors and12 tutees) at the University of Sharjah. Data were analyzed inductively through thematic content analysis following the COREQ guidelines. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) Tutors’ perspectives and experiences, (2) Tutees’ perspectives and experiences, and (3) Barriers to peer tutoring. Peer tutoring was found to enhance academic comprehension, communication, and confidence, while also fostering collaboration and empathy. Challenges included language barriers, inconsistent commitment, and limited time for relationship building Conclusions Peer tutoring represents an effective, student-centered learning strategy that supports academic success, promotes psychological safety, and nurtures professional competencies among nursing students. Findings underscore the need for structured, institutionally supported peer tutoring programs that address linguistic diversity, ensure tutor preparation, and integrate emotional and cultural sensitivity into nursing curricula.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1129/v2?src=rss">Integration of Breaking and Computational Physics: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Contextualized Teaching [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study presents an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach aimed at contextualizing the teaching of classical mechanics through the computational analysis of breaking movements. Situated within a constructivist framework, the research explores how culturally embedded practices—specifically urban dance—can serve as a medium for fostering conceptual understanding of physics in non-formal educational settings. By leveraging the artistic and kinesthetic dimensions of breaking, the study seeks to bridge the gap between abstract scientific content and learners’ lived experiences. Method A mixed-method, exploratory design was employed with a purposive sample of ten dancers (aged 13–30) affiliated with a community-based urban dance school in Bogotá, Colombia. Over the course of six three-hour sessions, participants engaged in movement analysis using Tracker video software, supported by pre- and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. The research design incorporated thematic analysis to interpret qualitative data, complemented by the kinematic study of body movement parameters such as angular velocity and center of mass. Results Findings indicate a marked cognitive shift among participants from intuitive and superficial conceptions to a more technical and applied understanding of physics principles. The integration of computational tools allowed dancers to visualize and internalize biomechanical variables relevant to their performance. Participants reported enhanced bodily control, injury prevention, and aesthetic execution, alongside increased motivation and collaborative learning. Conclusions The study concludes that embedding scientific content within culturally relevant, embodied practices—mediated by educational technologies—can significantly enhance learning outcomes in physics. The use of Tracker software not only demystified abstract concepts but also redefined physics as accessible and contextually meaningful. These results underscore the pedagogical potential of transdisciplinary, arts-integrated methodologies to foster inclusive, situated, and cognitively rich science education in non-traditional environments.

                Contrary to the classical view that sensory circuits stabilize after early critical periods, Lee, Han, et al. demonstrate that the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) continues to undergo functionally significant remodeling into adulthood. This late-stage refinement, mediated by the synaptic adhesion molecule LRRTM3, selectively rebalances corticothalamic inputs to the TRN via distinct extracellular mechanisms. LRRTM3-dependent circuit maturation is essential for achieving adult-like perceptual precision.

With the growing prevalence of neurological and mental health challenges, there is now an urgent imperative to understand the impacts of this diversity and change on the brain. This will require large-scale and long-term global studies of neural activity coupled with measures of lifestyle and life experience, environmental exposures, and mental and cognitive outcomes across diverse populations that lend themselves to untangling multivariate effects. We describe our experience developing large-scale EEG neuroimaging data acquisition programs in India and Tanzania and highlight key considerations for ensuring that such programs are ethically sound, cost-effective, scalable, adaptable and capable of producing high-quality data.

Their simulations suggest that dense phytoplankton at the surface would have created a greener ocean which may have prevented sunlight from reaching subsurface levels and contributed to reduced ocean productivity.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 17 February 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69056-1">doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69056-1</a></p>In October 2024, Valencia, Spain, suffered extreme rainfall that triggered devastating flash-floods. Within a few hours, rainfall accumulations exceeded typical annual totals, breaking the national record for one-hour rainfall in Spain. This event is considered the most destructive weather-related disaster in contemporary Spain in terms of human and economic losses. Calvo-Sancho et al. show that human-driven climate warming significantly intensified the storm, making the disaster markedly more destructive than it would have been in the pre-industrial era1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105195">Neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that target the PcrV component of the type III secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa act through distinct mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a major human opportunistic pathogen associated with a high incidence of multi-drug resistance. The antibody-based blockade of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> virulence factors represents a promising alternative strategy to mitigate its infectivity. In this study, we employed single B cell sorting from cystic fibrosis patients to isolate human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting proteins from the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) and characterized a panel of mAbs directed at PscF and PcrV. Among those, two mAbs, P5B3 and P3D6, that bind to the injectisome tip protein PcrV, exhibited T3SS blocking activity. We solved the crystal structure of the P3D6 Fab-PcrV complex, which revealed that the Ab binds to the C-terminal region of PcrV. In addition, we compared the T3SS-blocking activity of three PcrV-targeting mAbs, including two from previous independent studies, using two distinct assays to evaluate pore formation and toxin injection. We conducted a mechanistic and structural analysis of their modes of action through modeling based on the known structure of a functional homolog, SipD from <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. The analysis suggests that anti-PcrV mAbs may act through different mechanisms, ranging from preventing PcrV oligomerization to disrupting PcrV’s scaffolding function, thereby inhibiting the assembly and function of the translocon pore. Our findings provide additional evidence that T3SS-targeting Abs, some capable of inhibiting virulence, are elicited in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-infected patients. The results offer deeper insights into PcrV recognition by mAbs and their associated mechanisms of action, helping to identify which Abs are more likely to be therapeutically useful based on their mode of action and potency. This paves the way for the development of effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics in the fight against this resilient pathogen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108159">Deep neural networks to register and annotate cells in moving and deforming nervous systems</a></h4>

              
                Aligning and annotating the heterogeneous cell types that make up complex cellular tissues remains a major challenge in the analysis of biomedical imaging data. Here, we present a series of deep neural networks that allow for automatic non-rigid registration and cell identification, developed in the context of freely moving and deforming invertebrate nervous systems. A semi-supervised learning approach was used to train a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> registration network (BrainAlignNet) that aligns pairs of images of the bending <i>C. elegans</i> head with single-pixel-level accuracy. When incorporated into an image analysis pipeline, this network can link neurons over time with 99.6% accuracy. This network could also be readily purposed to align neurons from the jellyfish <i>Clytia hemisphaerica</i>, an organism with a vastly different body plan and set of movements. A separate network (AutoCellLabeler) was trained to annotate &gt;100 neuronal cell types in the <i>C. elegans</i> head based on multi-spectral fluorescence of genetic markers. This network labels &gt;100 different cell types per animal with 98% accuracy, exceeding individual human labeler performance by aggregating knowledge across manually labeled datasets. Finally, we trained a third network (CellDiscoveryNet) to perform unsupervised discovery of &gt;100 cell types in the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system: by comparing multi-spectral imaging data from many animals, it can automatically identify and annotate cell types without using any human labels. The performance of CellDiscoveryNet matched that of trained human labelers. These tools should be immediately useful for a wide range of biological applications and should be straightforward to generalize to many other contexts requiring alignment and annotation of dense heterogeneous cell types in complex tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108268">Kinematics and morphological correlates of descent strategies in arboreal mammals suggest early upright postures in euprimates</a></h4>

              
                Ascending and descending sloping and vertical branches are critical for arboreal locomotion and likely played a major role in early primate evolution. While most studies have focused on ascent, descending behaviors also provide insight into the functional significance of arboreal adaptations. To test how descending vertical supports of varying diameters affect locomotor abilities, we quantified postural and kinematic features during descents and ascents on vertical supports in 21 eutherian and metatherian mammals and examined their relation to morphology. Primates showed greater variability in descent behaviors, using tail-first and side postures more often than other mammals, which predominantly descended head-first. Overall, animals adopted several kinematic adjustments to enhance stability during descent compared to ascent, including slower speeds, higher duty factors, and greater use of asymmetrical gaits. Additionally, vertical descent strategies reflected trade-offs among body mass, limb proportions, and head mass. Using a morphology-based model, we then inferred possible descent behaviors in 13 extinct euarchontoglires. Our results suggest that ancestral adaptations for vertical locomotion may have promoted frequent upright (head-up) postures in early primates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107480">Linking spinal circuit reorganization to recovery after thoracic spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Rats exhibit significant recovery of locomotor function following incomplete spinal cord injuries, albeit with altered gait expression and reduced speed and stepping frequency. These changes likely result from and give insight into the reorganization within spared and injured spinal circuitry. Previously, we developed computational models of the mouse spinal locomotor circuitry controlling speed-dependent gait expression (Danner et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2022). Here, we adapted these models to the rat and used the adapted model to explore potential circuit-level changes underlying altered gait expression observed after recovery from two different thoracic spinal cord injuries (lateral hemisection and contusion) that have roughly comparable levels of locomotor recovery (Danner et al., 2023). The model reproduced experimentally observed gait expression before injury and after recovery from lateral hemisection and contusion and suggests two distinct, injury-specific routes to restored function. First, recovery after lateral hemisection required substantial functional restoration of damaged descending drive and long propriospinal connections, suggesting compensatory plasticity through formation of detour pathways. Second, recovery after a moderate midline contusion predominantly relied on reorganization of spared sublesional networks and altered control of supralesional cervical circuits, compensating for weakened propriospinal and descending pathways. Despite these differences, sensitivity analysis revealed that restored activation of sublesional lumbar rhythm-generating circuits and appropriately balanced lumbar commissural connectivity are the key determinants of post-injury gait expression, suggesting that injury symmetry shapes how the cord reorganizes, but effective recovery in both cases depends on re-engaging these lumbar networks, which makes them prime targets for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98637">On the nature of the earliest known lifeforms</a></h4>

              
                Microfossils from the Paleoarchean Eon are the oldest known evidence of life. Despite their significance in understanding the history of life on Earth, any interpretation of the nature of these microfossils has been a point of contention among researchers. Decades of back-and-forth arguments led to the consensus that reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is the most promising way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation of minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8–2.5 Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology. Based on these observations, we propose that morphology is not a reliable indicator of taxonomy in these microfossils.

                Spider orb-web building is a captivating, rare example of animal construction, whose neural underpinnings remain undiscovered. We created a three-dimensional atlas for the hackled-orb weaver, <i>Uloborus diversus</i>, based on immunostaining for the presynaptic component, synapsin, in whole-mounted spider synganglia. Whereas spider neuroanatomy has thus far been most comprehensively studied in cursorial species, this optically sectioned atlas contributes a continuous, finely resolved model of the central nervous system of an orb-web building spider. Aligned to this volume, we examined the expression patterns of neuronal populations representing many of the classical neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (GABA, acetylcholine, serotonin, and octopamine/tyramine), as well as a subset of neuropeptides (allatostatin A, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), FMRFamide, proctolin) – detailing immunoreactivity in an unbiased fashion throughout the synganglion to reveal co-expression in known structures (such as the arcuate body), as well as novel neuropils not readily apparent in prior spider research, including the tonsillar neuropil as well as a potential protocerebral bridge. These structures provide targets for future functional studies, and taken together, could represent a spider equivalent of the central complex, contributing to behaviors such as web-building.

                To enable navigation in both physical and mental spaces, the human brain employs a cognitive map constructed from the global metrics of the entorhinal cortex and the local representations of the hippocampus. However, how these two regions coordinate to enable navigation remains poorly understood. Here, we designed an object-matching task where human participants unknowingly manipulated object variants arranged in a ring-like structure around a central prototype. Functional MRI revealed a threefold spatial periodicity in the hippocampal activity that tracked navigation directions from object variants to the central prototype. This hippocampal periodicity was phase-locked with the well-documented sixfold periodicity of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting hierarchical interaction between these regions. Consistent with this neural pattern, a corresponding threefold periodicity was observed in behavioral performance, which was synchronized with hippocampal activity. Finally, an EC-HPC PhaseSync model reproduced this phenomenon, in which the sixfold activity periodicity of entorhinal grid cells across directions projects vectorial representations to the hippocampus, and the collection of these vectors exhibits threefold periodicity to represent conceptual directions. Together, these findings reveal a periodic mechanism through which entorhinal grid codes structure hippocampal vector representations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108420">Neural connectome of the ctenophore statocyst</a></h4>

              
                Ctenophores possess a unique gravity receptor (statocyst) in their aboral organ formed by four clusters of ciliated balancer cells that collectively support a statolith. During reorientation, differential loads on the balancer cilia lead to altered beating of the ciliated comb rows to elicit turns. To study the neural bases of gravity sensing, we used volume electron microscopy to image the aboral organ of the ctenophore <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>. We reconstructed 1011 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connections with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organization. Our results suggest a coordinating rather than sensory–motor function for the nerve net and inform our understanding of the diversity of nervous-system organization across animals.

">Primary and Supplementary Motor cortex implement parallel control solutions for rhythmic and discrete arm movements</a></h4>

              
                Arm movements are rhythmic, discrete, or some combination of the two. Conflicting evidence supports each of two possible solutions for how motor cortex controls them: that either it uses the same strategy for controlling rhythmic and discrete movements or different strategies for distinct movement types. Using recurrent neural network modelling and multi-unit recordings during an arm-cycling task, we show that primate motor cortex uses both solutions. Primary motor cortex (M1) dynamics converge to the same limit-cycle when executing both movement types. In contrast, supplementary motor area (SMA) dynamics diverge according to the type of the upcoming movement before reaching a helical spiral. Our results reconcile opposing views on the cortical control of rhythmic and discrete movements by showing that the two solutions are not mutually exclusive but implemented in parallel within motor cortex. Instead, our results challenge us to understand why both solutions are implemented to solve the same problem.

">Selective reorganization of face-processing lateralization in participants with right-lateralized language network</a></h4>

              
                A well-known feature of cortical organization is the lateralization of the language network (LN) to the left hemisphere (LH). Although atypical LN lateralization to the right hemisphere (RH) is well documented, its consequences for other lateralized functions remain poorly understood. Face processing and other category-selective visual areas, which are typically RH-biased, provide key test cases for examining whether atypical LN lateralization is associated with reorganization in other networks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we identified participants with right-hemisphere language dominance (RHLD) and examined whether category-selective visual areas exhibit reorganized hemispheric biases in these participants relative to those with typical left-hemisphere language dominance (LHLD). The results demonstrated selective reorganization within the face-selective areas: some regions showed a leftward shift in hemispheric bias in RHLD participants, whereas others preserved the canonical RH preference. This pattern indicates that cortical reorganization associated with atypical LN lateralization is region-specific rather than global, consistent with a flexible neural architecture in which hemispheric specialization can be selectively reconfigured. These results clarify how atypical LN lateralization impacts the hemispheric organization of face-selective areas and provide evidence for altered network-level specialization in the cerebral cortex.

">Region- and layer-specific glutamatergic synapse development in the nascent cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical synapses are highly dynamic during brain development, undergoing formation, elimination, and maturation before acquiring properties that support adult cognition. Individual neocortical regions develop at different ages and individual layers within these regions contain distinct neuronal subtypes that process unique patterns of local and long-range synaptic input. To better understand the development of the cortical hierarchy we explored the laminar maturation of glutamatergic synapses across cortical regions. Synapse maturation was associated with the upregulation of the postsynaptic density protein PSD95. This maturation occurred in a region- and layer-specific manner; layers associated with feedforward pathways develop earlier, while layers associated with higher-order circuits develop later. Our findings highlight adolescence as an important period for the cortex-wide maturation of synapses in cortical layer 1, synapses known to receive top-down feedback from higher-order cortices. We propose that this delayed adolescent maturation of top-down input represents a global signature of cortical development and seemingly acts as the final stage of outside-in brain maturation.

">Adaptive sequential eye-movement sampling and replay under different task demands</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition is capacity-limited, requiring strategies to actively structure information. Eye movements offer a natural mechanism for sequential sampling, but whether such sequences organize mnemonic representations is unknown. We developed a working-memory task where color-frequency pairings created a consistent latent ordinal structure to optimally reduce memory load. Across two experiments, gaze patterns spontaneously aligned with this structure. Participants sampled items following this sequence during encoding and covertly replayed it during maintenance. Critically, the expression of this structure depended on cognitive demand. In a 3-item task, high performers showed robust sequential sampling during encoding, whereas lower performers compensated with replay-like revisitation during maintenance. Under higher demand (4 items), encoding-based organization was disrupted, and structured replay emerged primarily during maintenance to support memory. These findings show that eye movements do more than reflect memory; they actively organize it, revealing a flexible, behavioral analogue to neural replay when encoding resources are strained.

">Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dorsal periaqueductal gray encode decisions to assess and escape natural threats</a></h4>

              
                Prey species are able to engage hardwired neural pathways to rapidly escape from an imminent predator attack. However, when predator threat is less probable they typically show a stereotypical sequence of approach toward the threat aimed at gathering more information, followed by escape to safety when the threat threshold is reached. The brainstem dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) is required for the expression of escape behavior to predator threats and stimulation of dPAG elicits goal-directed flight. However, in vivo neural recordings in dPAG have identified separate populations of neurons that are tuned to either the approach or escape phase of the behavior suggesting that the structure may also be involved in threat assessment. The genetic identity and connectivity of these Assessment+ and Escape+ neurons have not been defined, although optogenetic activation of glutamatergic, but not GABAergic neurons elicits high-speed flight, suggesting that Escape+ neurons might be exclusively excitatory in nature. Moreover, it is not clear whether non-predator threats such as those elicited by conspecific or other animate threats are encoded by independent or overlapping neurons in dPAG. Here we report the activity pattern of ensembles of glutamatergic and GABAergic dPAG neurons during approach and escape from predator, social, and prey threats. Unexpectedly, we found that both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons harbor Assessment+ and Escape+ neurons, suggesting that both cell-types are engaged in the approach-to-avoidance transition. Consistent with the functional involvement of both cell-types in approach-to-avoidance behavior, optogenetic activation of GABAergic cells elicited a reduction of risk assessment behavior towards the predator. Finally, we found that exposure to predator, social or prey threat recruited largely overlapping neurons in dPAG, demonstrating a convergence of threat processing in this structure. These findings point to a tightly coordinated role for dPAG excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the generalized control of innate threat assessment and avoidance behavior.

">Aging reprograms the response to chronic stress</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress is thought to accelerate brain aging. We find this to be true in the brains of young mice, but reversed in the old. Using chronic variable stress in young (2-month) and aged (24-month) mice, we show that aged animals perceive stress physiologically but exhibit stress-responses that differ from those of young mice on behavioral, synaptic, and molecular levels. Multi-Omics profiling of prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens and 3D vasculature measurements reveals that stress in aged mice activates angiogenic programs that oppose aging-related patterns. Our results demonstrate that stress cannot be universally conceptualized as an aging accelerator, but instead engages age-specific programs with opposite directionality in young and old animals.

">Z-RNA-ZBP1 axis drives Tau-mediated neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Although the causes of Tau aggregates vary, once Tau aggregates are formed, their neurotoxicity significantly contributes to neuronal death and cognitive decline in tauopathies, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most well-known example. Despite its central pathogenic role, however, effective therapeutic strategies targeting neurotoxicity of Tau remain poor. Here we demonstrate the pathogenic role of neuronal cell death in Tau-related neurodegeneration. Tau-expressing neurons undergo cell death through Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) activation triggered by endogenous Z-RNAs. These Z-RNAs are derived from reactivated transposable elements (TEs) that are typically silenced within heterochromatin. Tau aggregates show a strong affinity for H3K9me3-modified chromatin, effectively sequestering these epigenetic marks from Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), thereby disrupting the condensation of constitutive heterochromatin. Clinically, an inverse correlation between ZBP1 expression levels in excitatory neurons and cognitive performance in AD patients was observed. Importantly, Zbp1 haploinsufficiency significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in aged Tau-transgenic mice (24-month-old), highlighting the therapeutic potential of ZBP1 inhibition to strive against neurodegeneration in tauopathies.

">Light-driven repair: Photobiomodulation restores blood brain barrier function following hypoxic injury</a></h4>

              
                A functional blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and its disruption is an early event in acute brain injury and chronic neurodegeneration. Hypoxia triggers BBB breakdown, promoting endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation and thrombo-inflammatory responses that compromise barrier integrity. However, strategies that directly restore BBB function remain limited. Here, we investigated whether photobiomodulation (PBM), a non-invasive light therapy, can rescue BBB dysfunction following acute hypoxic stress. Using a multicellular in vitro BBB model comprising immortalised human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes, we induced hypoxic injury (6 h, 1% O2) and applied three PBM treatments during recovery. Hypoxia significantly reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), whereas PBM restored barrier function in endothelial monocultures and tri-cultures. Endothelial cells showed the strongest hypoxic response, with increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and von Willebrand factor (vWF), all attenuated by PBM. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of vWF partially recapitulated PBM-induced barrier rescue, identifying endothelial vWF as a mediator of recovery. PBM also reduced reactive oxygen species in hypoxic astrocytes and pericytes, indicating coordinated multicellular modulation. These findings demonstrate that PBM restores BBB integrity after hypoxic insult by modulating endothelial thrombo-inflammatory signalling while reducing oxidative stress in glial cells. Rather than acting as a general cytoprotective stimulus, PBM engages defined molecular pathways linked to endothelial activation. This work establishes a mechanistically informed platform for studying BBB repair and supports PBM as a targeted strategy to protect vascular integrity in hypoxia-associated neurological disorders.

">Fast-ripples are emergent properties of neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                Fast-ripples have been proposed as a promising biomarker in epilepsy, but their specificity remains unclear. In particular, it is uncertain whether they reflect chance coincident neural activity or distinctly generated pathological entities. We combined in silico simulations, neuronal cultures, a rodent model of hippocampal epilepsy, and human microwire recordings to investigate whether fast-ripples occur more frequently than expected by the chance aggregation of action potentials. Our simulations showed that chance aggregation can generate fast-ripples and predicted higher occurrence during wakefulness, which was confirmed in rodent recordings. The likelihood of exceeding chance depended on biological system complexity and vigilance state: fast-ripples in neuronal cultures did not surpass chance, whereas those in awake - but not sleeping - rodents did. Similarly, the frequency of fast-ripples in awake human recordings was ~30% greater than expected by chance. As such, our findings suggest that most fast-ripples reflect stochastic network activity rather than distinctly generated pathological entities, challenging prevailing assumptions about their pathogenesis and biomarker specificity.

">Seeing Just Enough: The Contribution of Hands, Objects and Visual Features to Egocentric Action Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Humans recognize everyday actions without conscious effort despite challenges such as poor viewing conditions and visual similarity between actions. Yet the visual features contributing to action recognition remain unclear. To address this, we combined semantic modelling and feature reduction methods to identify critical features for recognizing actions from challenging egocentric perspectives. We first identified egocentric action videos from home environments that a motion-focused action classification network could correctly classify (Easy videos) or not (Hard videos). In Experiment 1, participants (N=136) labelled the action and object in the videos. Using a language model framework, we derived human ground truth labels for each video and quantified its recognition consistency based on semantic similarity. Participants recognized actions and objects in Easy videos more consistently than in Hard videos. In Experiment 2, we recursively reduced the Easy and Hard videos with high recognition consistency to extract minimal recognizable configurations (MIRCs), in which any further spatial or temporal reductions disrupted recognition. The data was collected using a large-scale online study (N=4360). We extracted information related to the hand, objects, scene background and visual features (e.g., orientation or motion signals) from the 474 MIRCs. Binary classification showed that recognition was disrupted when regions containing the manipulated object and strong orientation signals were removed, while temporal reduction by frame-scrambling disrupted recognition in 73% of MIRCs. The active hand had some marginal contribution. Our results highlight the importance of both mid- and high-level information for egocentric action recognition and link hierarchical feature theories with naturalistic human perception.

">p-Brain: An Automated MRI Pipeline for Cerebral Perfusion, Microvasculature, and Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Estimation</a></h4>

              
                We present p-Brain, an end-to-end neuroimaging analysis framework for reproducible, automated quantitative DCE-MRI analysis at scale. From standard acquisitions, p-Brain estimates baseline relaxation parameters, converts signal to gadolinium concentration, derives arterial and venous input functions using convolutional neural network (CNN) slice selection and ROI segmentation, and produces voxelwise maps with regional and whole-brain summaries. The pipeline implements Patlak graphical analysis to estimate the blood-brain barrier influx constant (Ki) and plasma volume fraction (vp), and performs model-free residue deconvolution with Tikhonov regularisation to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and capillary transit-time heterogeneity (CTH) from the same DCE dataset. p-Brain exports analysis-ready outputs, intermediate readouts, structured runtime metadata, and stage-level quality control artifacts to support auditability in batch processing. We evaluate the framework on a technically uniform set of 97 DCE-MRI scans from 58 healthy human participants, and show close agreement between automated Patlak Ki summaries and an established reference workflow. A companion macOS desktop application supports batch execution, job monitoring, and rapid review of curves and maps. p-Brain is open-source and configurable, enabling extension to additional kinetic models.

">Sparse mixed codes on shared manifolds for human-like spatial attention in artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Spatial attention is often partitioned into endogenous, exogenous, and social forms, yet it remains unclear whether a single neural circuit can support all three and how their population codes are organized. Here we trained recurrent artificial neural networks (ANNs) with convolutional sensory front-ends on three classic cueing paradigms (central, peripheral, and gaze cues) to reproduce human reaction time (RT) profiles across cue-target onset asynchronies. Despite differences in sensory architecture and visual experience, all ANNs captured the full facilitation-inhibition time course for all three attention types. Model-based targeted dimensionality reduction (mTDR) revealed that cue- and choice-related activity in the advanced cognitive module evolved as rotations within a shared low-dimensional manifold, with angular deflections that mirrored the distinct temporal dynamics of endogenous, exogenous, and social attention. Attentional signals were encoded by highly sparse, distributed population activity: a small subset of recurrent units explained most task-related variance, was sufficient to recover human-like RT patterns after virtual lesioning, and became progressively sparser as training improved performance. At the same time, single unit responses displayed pervasive mixed selectivity, dominated by nonlinear conjunctions of cue type, cue direction, and validity, whose strength and heterogeneity robustly predicted model performance. Together, these results identified low-dimensional geometric rotations, sparse coding, and nonlinear mixed selectivity as core computational principles through which a single recurrent circuit could generate human-like temporal dynamics across endogenous, exogenous, and social orienting, and provided testable predictions for population-level mechanisms of spatial attention in the brain.

">Subicular Plateaus Signal Reward Locations during Goal-Directed Behavior</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is essential for spatial learning, yet how its principal output structure, the subiculum, encodes behaviorally relevant information during navigation remains poorly understood. Because subicular neurons exhibit prominent burst firing, elucidating how this bursting is generated during behavior is critical. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings from dorsal subiculum neurons in head-fixed mice performing a goal-directed navigation task, we show that many bursts correspond to plateau events consisting of a series of action potentials riding on a large ([~]20-30 mV) sustained subthreshold depolarization. Subicular plateaus were synaptic in origin and required NMDA receptor activation. Organizing plateaus by the membrane potential preceding their onset revealed distinct behavioral associations. Plateaus initiated from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials preferentially clustered near reward locations, whereas plateaus initiated from more depolarized membrane potentials were more spatially distributed and showed weaker reward specificity. Reward-related clustering required a fixed, learned reward location and dynamically rearranged during learning of a new reward location. Together, our findings identify subicular plateaus as a prominent cellular substrate of hippocampal bursting output and demonstrate that intracellular membrane potential state organizes the behavioral associations of subicular plateaus during goal-directed learning.

">Comparative Neuroprotective Effects of Minocycline and Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells After Complete Spinal Cord Transection in Adult Rats</a></h4>

              
                Acute spinal cord injury triggers a complex secondary injury cascade characterized by lesion expansion, neuroinflammation, glial reactivity, and oligodendrocyte degeneration, which together limit endogenous repair. Identifying neuroprotective interventions capable of targeting distinct components of this cascade remains a major challenge. In this study, we compared the neuroprotective profiles of minocycline, a tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), which exert paracrine immunomodulatory and trophic effects, using a model of complete thoracic spinal cord transection in adult rats. Animals received either BMMCs (5 x 10^6; cells, intravenously, 24 h post-injury) or minocycline (50 mg/kg twice daily for 48 h, followed by 25 mg/kg for five days). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that both treatments attenuated secondary damage, reducing lesion area, microglial/macrophage activation (ED1 cells), and oligodendrocyte pathology (Tau-1 cells). However, the magnitude and pattern of protection differed between interventions: minocycline produced a stronger reduction in lesion area, whereas BMMCs exerted greater suppression of microglial/macrophage activation and superior preservation of oligodendrocytes. Astrocyte counts (GFAP cells) did not differ quantitatively among groups, despite qualitative differences in astrocytic morphology. Integrated effect size analysis further highlighted these complementary neuroprotective profiles across outcomes. Collectively, these findings indicate that minocycline and BMMCs target distinct components of secondary injury after severe spinal cord injury, providing a mechanistic rationale for future studies exploring multi-targeted or combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

">Combination Drug Therapy Reduces Iron Accumulation and Microglia-Mediated Pathologies in Neonatal Intraventricular Hemorrhage: A Biochemical and Transcriptomic Analysis</a></h4>

              
                This study describes the distribution of non-reactive brain-resident microglia densely populated along the borders of the lateral ventricles and choroid plexus in premature rabbit pups during early forebrain development. Following intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), microglia become activated, proliferate, and migrate deeper into parenchymal regions. During this process, activated microglia exhibit a global expansion with a disproportionally elevated proinflammatory M1 nomenclature phenotype from 25% to 50% of the total; that shift was reduced by sulforaphane (SFN; Nrf2-antioxidant response element [ARE] activator of anti-inflammatory pathways) plus deferoxamine (DFN; iron chelator) treatment. Transcriptome analysis identified over expression of pro-inflammatory calcium-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A12 (intracellular damage signals), as well as chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL10 by neurons and microglia. The combination treatment of SFN-DFN mitigated M1 infiltration, suppressed the magnitude of inflammation and reduced ferroptosis after IVH in the developing postnatal brain. Moreover, SFN-DFN treatment reversed most dysregulated genes in inflammation and iron homeostasis networks, revealing potential molecular targets for additional pharmacologic interventions after IVH. We propose that reducing the toxic microcellular environment will attenuate both the injurious inflammatory responses and improve recovery of the trajectory toward normal brain development. Additionally, suppression of proinflammatory molecules and iron toxicity should promote better survival as well as salutary effects of living stem cell therapy as we have previously shown.

">At the Roots of Plant Awareness Disparity (PAD): Semantic processing and Numerosity Perception</a></h4>

              
                Plant Awareness Disparity (PAD) refers to the inability of humans to notice plants and recognize their importance. Among the various factors (e.g., cultural) contributing to PAD, the less prominent visual cues of plants (e.g., color) might be one of the main features making them less noticeable to human perception. Here, we investigated whether PAD affects basic numerosity perception, which represents a fundamental cognitive ability that allows individuals to interpret and interact with their surroundings. Across three experiments, we compared how participants perceive the numerosity of plants (specifically trees), animals, and minerals. Participants completed two tasks: an estimation task, in which they reported the exact number of items in a single set and a comparison task, which required them to discriminate numerosity between two sets of items. In Experiment 1, both tasks employed colored images. We hypothesized that participants would underestimate the number of plant items in comparison to animals and minerals, given that plant stimuli typically attract less attention. In Experiment 2, black and white images were used to test whether the green color of plants contributes to PAD. In Experiment 3, all items were rotated of 180{degrees} to disrupt semantic recognition and assess whether PAD arises from higher-level cognitive processes. Results revealed a consistent underestimation of plants in Experiment 1 and 2, but this effect diminished in Experiment 3. The reduction of this effect suggests that semantic recognition processes may contribute to PAD. These results highlight how cognitive biases toward plants can influence basic perceptual judgments essential for everyday functioning.

">Disrupted Inhibitory-Excitatory Balance Underlies Spinal Motoneuron Dysfunction in Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                Incomplete spinal cord injury disrupts voluntary movement, in part through motoneuron dysfunction, yet the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain poorly understood. Using a non-invasive approach to decode the spiking activity of large populations of spinal motoneurons, we quantified the relative contributions of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs to motoneuron rate coding after chronic incomplete spinal cord injury. Eighteen participants with incomplete spinal cord injury and 18 age- and sex-matched control participants performed submaximal isometric plantar flexion tasks while high-density surface electromyography was recorded from the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles. Motoneuron firing behaviour was analysed to estimate neuromodulatory drive and the balance between inhibitory and excitatory inputs. Participants with incomplete spinal cord injury exhibited lower rate coding, characterised by lower firing rates at recruitment, lower firing rate modulation, and lower peak firing rates compared with healthy controls. Although estimates of neuromodulatory drive did not differ between groups, individuals with spinal cord injury showed a shift in the inhibition-excitation balance toward greater inhibition compared with controls. Furthermore, increasing inhibitory input through muscle length changes and antagonist tendon vibration modulated motoneuron firing in controls, but not in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Together, these findings suggest that impaired rate coding after incomplete spinal cord injury arises from an altered inhibitory-excitatory balance rather than reduced neuromodulatory drive. Taking advantage of methodological advances to decode spinal motor neuron activity during voluntary contraction, this study identified excessive inhibitory input to spinal motoneurons as a key neural mechanism contributing to muscle weakness and impaired motor function in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury.

">An Efficient Computing Theory of Prefrontal Structured Working Memory Representations</a></h4>

              
                The efficient coding hypothesis presents a compelling success story for theoretical and systems neuroscience. It marshals a unifying idea, that neural codes can be understood as efficient encodings of natural stimuli, to explain phenomena from across sensory systems, sometimes with exquisite precision. However, similar normative assaults on cognitive representations, such as those in prefrontal or entorhinal cortex, have been less comprehensively successful. We argue that this reflects efficient coding's focus on encoded variables, overlooking the computations that neural circuits implement. Here, instead, we develop an efficient computing theory that studies optimal implementations of recurrent cognitive computations. We apply this framework to the prefrontal cortex, in particular, to a rich vein of neural recordings: structured working memory tasks, such as recalling a sequence. Despite using near-identical tasks, the literature has reported two distinct coding schemes: one contextual, with neurons active only in a particular sequence, the other compositional, with neurons tuned to a single sequence element. Just as efficient coding links stimuli statistics to optimal representation, our theory relates task structure and statistics to optimal representation. In so doing, we find that compositional and contextual codes can be understood as two extremes of a spectrum of optimal representations, with the correlations amongst sequence elements determining a task's position on this spectrum. Our theory highlights previously underappreciated discrepancies between measured representations, explaining them via subtle task differences; and allows us to infer the algorithm underlying otherwise ambiguous neural data. In sum, we demonstrate an efficient computing approach that makes normative statements about cognitive representations, and serves as a tool for understanding a swathe of neural data.

">Spine-neck electrical bottlenecks tune temporal precision and inhibitory gating in cortical pyramidal neurons: A connectomics-based biophysical study</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are nano-scale compartments that host the majority of excitatory synapses on cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs); hundreds of spines/PN also receive an inhibitory synapse (dually-innervated spines, DiSs). Using analytic theory and detailed biophysical models of ~2,000 densely reconstructed spines, we show that recurrent spine-neck narrowing substantially increases spine-neck resistance (Rneck), and that elevated Rneck accelerates spine-head voltage dynamics, shortening spinous postsynaptic potentials by up to ~3-fold. Rneck improves the tracking of high-frequency synaptic inputs and strongly modulates Ca2+ signaling and the potency and temporal precision of inhibitory gating in DiSs. This work identifies Rneck as a dynamic "knob", directly linking spine ultrastructure to information processing and plasticity in cortical PNs and circuits, yielding testable experimental predictions. Our "biophysics of connectomics" paradigm naturally raises computational-oriented questions, including how inhibitory "gates" in dendritic spines expand context-dependent computations, implement single-cell and network-level routing, and enable selective encoding of precise temporal patterns.

">Periaqueductal gray neurotensin neurons drive simultaneousthreat response and reinforcement</a></h4>

              
                The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a midbrain structure known to influence responses to both threat and reward. The PAG sends projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region critical for regulating motivated behavior via dopamine release. We previously identified a population of VTA-projecting PAG neurons that express the peptide neurotensin (Nts), a potent dopamine neuron activator. Here we find that PAG-Nts neurons co-release glutamate and Nts in the VTA to drive dopamine neuron activation. These neurons are activated by threats and threat-predictive cues and are inhibited by entry into a shelter and during reward consumption. Optogenetic stimulation elicits a robust threat response, including freezing and tail rattle, but remarkably can also drive intracranial self-stimulation. This operant reinforcement behavior is dopamine dependent while the threat response is not. Together, these results identify a dual-output circuit that engages the dopamine system, likely to increase the salience of environmental stimuli, while simultaneously driving specific threat response behaviors.

">Human Cerebral Cortex Organization Characterized by Functional PET-FDG "Metabolic Connectivity"</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: In this study, we characterize the spatiotemporal organization of resting-state metabolic connectivity (RSMC) in the human brain, as measured by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) functional PET (fPET-FDG). We examine the relationship between RSMC organization and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging and other known cortical organizational principles. Methods: Resting-state fPET-FDG data from 24 individuals were obtained from a publicly available repository. We characterized local metabolic organization using connectivity-based boundary mapping, with adaptations to account for the low signal-to-noise ratio of fPET-FDG data. We then estimated global metabolic organization through community detection-based network and principal gradient analyses. Furthermore, we examined how metabolic connectivity is shaped by temporal-frequency-specific components of fPET-FDG signal. Finally, we contextualized metabolic organization by relating metabolic gradients to anatomical, functional, and energetic reference measures. Results: At the local scale, boundary mapping results indicated structured transitions shaped by a combination of both fast and slow fPET-FDG signals, partly overlapping with RSFC boundary maps. Globally, RSMC analyses revealed a robust metabolic structure organized along a superior-inferior cortical gradient. This pattern remained consistent across network community detection and principal gradient analyses and was primarily driven by low-frequency, minute-scale fPET-FDG dynamics. The identified large-scale metabolic profile aligns closely with several known anatomical and energetic constraints. Conclusion: This study characterizes the spatiotemporal organizational principles of RSMC, deepening insight into the brain's energetic framework and providing a basis for future cognitive and clinical investigations of metabolic connectivity organization.

">Mapping spatially organized molecular and genetic signatures of schizophrenia across multiple scales in human prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) controls many cognitive and emotional processes that are disrupted in schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the spatial location of molecular changes associated with SCZ within the dlPFC remains poorly characterized. dlPFC cell types are spatially organized across six layers into microcircuits that mediate dlPFC function. While SCZ has been linked to regionally-defined cell types, spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) can more directly map molecular associations of disease. We integrated protein detection for perineuronal nets, neurons and vasculature with SRT to investigate how gene expression varies across different cellular microenvironments in the human dlPFC from neurotypical control (n=31) and SCZ (n=32) brain donors. We mapped transcriptional alterations in synaptic, neuroimmune and metabolic pathways to neuropil and glia-enriched domains including the white matter. Integrative analyses linked laminar alterations predominantly to non-neuronal populations, and in situ profiling further resolved these changes at cellular resolution, indicating intracellular transcriptional changes that may underpin SCZ-associated alterations. By mapping SCZ-associated ligand-receptor pairs, we curated altered patterns of cell-cell communication that may coordinate local signaling dynamics across specialized tissue microenvironments. Finally, analyses that integrate SCZ genetic risk further highlight the significance of neuron-glia interactions, suggesting that neuronal genetic liability may signal through non-neuronal alterations across cortical domains. This multimodal atlas provides a spatial-anatomical framework for linking genetic risk to transcriptional phenotypes in the human cortex, delineating SCZ-associated gene expression landscapes across layers, single cells, and microenvironments. The data is available as a browsable PsychENCODE resource to support broad utilization that can inform mechanistic studies investigating SCZ pathology and risk.

">The Interplay between Language Development, Short-Term Memory, and Auditory Associative Word Learning in Younger and Older Children</a></h4>

              
                Auditory associative word learning has been shown in infants and proven to be a difficult task in young adults, where learning is only successful under specific conditions. In order to better understand the transition from successful infant auditory associative word learning to the challenging adult learning, we tested 5-6-year-olds and 9-10-year-olds in a sequential associative task to investigate their ability in associating novel pseudowords with environmental sounds. Additionally, we explored short-term episodic recognition memory, language development, sex, and musical training and their effects on behavioral and electrophysiological measures of word learning. EEG data were collected to assess word learning in an initial training phase (consistent vs. inconsistent pairings) and a subsequent testing phase (matching vs. violated pairings) with additional button-press reactions for behavioral learning data. While learning effects were seen in the first half of the training phase in younger children, no early effects of learning were found in older children. Only musically trained 9-10-year-olds indicated word learning in the second half of the training phase. In the testing phase, only non-musically trained 9-10-year-olds revealed trend-level N400-like responses. Short-term memory (auditory-verbal, auditory-nonverbal, and visual-nonverbal) and language development improved with age, but only visual-nonverbal short-term recognition memory was positively correlated with improved auditory associative word learning. Unlike cross-modal visual associative word learning, our results, together with earlier findings in infants and young adults, suggest a difficulty in auditory associative word learning beyond infancy, which is sustained from childhood to young adulthood.

">Transsynaptic neural circuit mapping of ventral hippocampus motivational control systems</a></h4>

              
                The ventral hippocampus contributes to food intake regulation and a range of motivational and memory processes, and its dysfunction is associated with several cognitive and behavioral disorders. However, its circuit-level organization remains incompletely understood. Ventral CA1 (CA1v) neurons send projections to several regions involved in motivational control. Here we focus on three major forebrain targets: the nucleus accumbens shell (ACBsh), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). We mapped the upstream and downstream circuitry of CA1v neurons defined by their projections to these target regions in rats using complementary transsynaptic anterograde and retrograde viral tracing approaches. Monosynaptic outputs to ACBsh, mPFC, and LHA were targeted using ATLAS, a novel transsynaptic anterograde viral approach that drives Cre recombinase in neurons receiving glutamatergic synaptic transmission from the CA1v. Second-order projections arising from these defined pathways were then mapped using a Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracing strategy. In parallel, upstream inputs to CA1v neurons projecting to each downstream target were mapped using a conditional retrograde glycoprotein-deleted rabies viral approach. Anterograde tracing revealed both shared and pathway-specific second-order targets, including bidirectional CA1v projections. Retrograde tracing confirmed expected inputs (e.g., CA3) and uncovered previously unrecognized cortical sources that differed across downstream projection-defined CA1v subpopulations. Together, these findings delineate pathway-specific, multinode circuits linking CA1v neurons to key motivational systems that may inform future therapeutic strategies for disorders involving ventral hippocampal dysfunction.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>V4, an intermediate visual area in the ventral pathway of the primate visual system, is known to contain neurons selective to visual stimulus attributes of intermediate complexity. Recent studies have shown that macaque V4 is organized into neuronal columns, each tuned to specific natural image features, and topologically arranged across the cortical surface to form functionally specialized domains. Using digital twins of V4 constructed from a large-scale wide-field imaging dataset, we demonstrate that shape- and texture-preferring neurons—previously identified in single-unit studies—are spatially clustered into functional domains. The segregated spatial organization suggests the existence of parallel modules for surface and boundary processing. Unlike artificial neural networks trained for ImageNet classification, which exhibit a strong texture bias, we find that V4 cortical columns and functional domains are more evenly balanced between shape and texture preferences. Finally, we show that computational constraints of feature similarity and retinotopy constraints are necessary and sufficient to explain many observed properties of the organization of the V4 topological map of natural image feature preferences.</span>

Here, we tested how person knowledge modulates face processing. Participants were allocated randomly into two groups, and they were familiarized with faces, associated with artificial biographies. Crucially, while the faces were identical to both groups, the associated biographies were reversed for the two groups. We estimated cross-participant, leave-one-participant-out pairwise identity (ID) classifications from the EEG data within the two face-biography association groups and compared them to the those performed across the groups. We observed that face-biography knowledge associations led to robust familiarity signals from 300 ms, and to rapidly emerging ID representations starting from 80 ms. Importantly, the shared associations within participant groups led to a longer and stronger ID representation over left anterior and right posterior regions when compared to cross-group comparisons. The direct comparison of within and cross-group classifications showed that an early stage of ID representation (around 250–350 ms), is modulated by face-biography associations. Our findings suggest that person recognition memory modulates visual face ID representation already at an early processing stage and provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of how conceptual, biographical knowledge modulates familiar face representation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To personalize the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety, there is a need to identify biological constructs that underlie self-reported symptoms. Notably, physiological responses and levels of arousal are constituents of anxiety, and have widespread (“global”) effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals that may provide novel brain markers of anxiety. Here, we modeled autonomic physiological and cortical arousal signatures in fMRI data and determined whether these global fMRI components relate to measures of state and trait anxiety. Additionally, we tested if these global effects impact relationships between brain network connectivity and anxiety levels. We found significant relationships between fMRI global components and state/trait anxiety scores, identifying brain regions in which the strength of the global mean fMRI signal and the cortical arousal-related fMRI signal were associated with both state and trait anxiety. Notably, the resulting patterns exhibited substantial overlap with established large-scale functional networks, including the default-mode network. These findings indicate that global effects in fMRI signals hold valuable information that may reveal how cortical arousal is expressed in anxiety, and may provide a source of information that has previously been treated as a confound.</span>

Changing the induced current direction may allow preferential stimulation of different waves, but there is little empirical evidence on the underlying single cell mechanisms. We examined the responses to focal TMS over M1 of 249 corticospinal axons recorded at C5 in six anesthetized monkeys. D, early indirect (I1) and late I-waves could all be generated by TMS with both posterior–anterior (PA) and anterior–posterior (AP) induced currents. However, at moderate intensities, PA stimulation selectively generated D-waves, and AP generated late I-waves. Most axons only responded within one latency window (D, I1 or late I) to either orientation; the number responding in multiple windows grew with increasing intensity, especially for AP stimulation. Axon conduction velocity had no effect on response probability, except for axons responding to AP TMS at late I latency which had significantly faster conduction velocity than those without late I responses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-281/v1?src=rss">When Technology Matters Most: Fitness-App-Integrated Problem-Based Learning as Compensatory Scaffolding for Physical Literacy Among Low-Grit Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Physical literacy, encompassing motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge, and behavior, is increasingly recognized as a central outcome of physical education. Problem-based learning (PBL) and digital fitness applications have been proposed as student-centered approaches to support physical literacy development. However, evidence remains limited regarding whether the effectiveness of technology-integrated PBL varies according to learners’ non-cognitive characteristics, particularly grit. Methods This study employed a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design to examine the effects of fitness-app-integrated problem-based learning and student grit level on physical literacy outcomes. Participants were 64 Grade XI vocational secondary school students in Indonesia who were assigned to either PBL with fitness application support or PBL without application support. Students were categorized into high- and low-grit groups based on a validated physical education–specific grit scale. Physical literacy was assessed using an adapted Indonesian version of the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy, Second Edition (CAPL-2). Post-intervention data were analysed using two-way analysis of variance. Results A significant interaction was found between instructional model and grit level. Students with lower grit demonstrated significantly higher physical literacy scores in the app-supported PBL condition compared with the non-app condition. In contrast, students with higher grit showed comparable physical literacy outcomes across instructional models. No significant overall main effect of instructional model was observed. Conclusions The findings indicate that fitness application integration within problem-based learning may provide compensatory support for students with lower grit, while offering limited additional benefit for students with higher grit. These results highlight the importance of aligning technology use with learner characteristics when designing instructional approaches to support physical literacy in vocational physical education.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus, a key neural structure supporting episodic memory, comprises distinct subfields including the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis (CA1–3), and subiculum. Hippocampal subfields typically show age-related volumetric decline across adulthood, but the regional aging may be differentially vulnerable to cardiovascular risk factors. Here, we examined the association between hippocampal subfield volumes and cardiovascular risk indices—hypertension, blood pressure variation (BPV), body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio—in groups of younger (<i>n</i> = 37, ages 18–29 years) and older adults (<i>n</i> = 22, ages 60–79 years). The findings revealed a specific link between cardiovascular health and hippocampal subfield volumes, with the subiculum showing greater sensitivity. Among younger adults, hypertension predicted smaller subiculum, while higher BMI correlated with larger CA1–2 volumes. For older adults, higher BPV predicted smaller subiculum volume, independent of hypertension that correlated with larger regional volume. Age moderated the relation between all indices and subiculum volume except waist-to-hip ratio. These findings highlight age-dependent, subfield-specific risk factors for hippocampal aging and underscore the potential for identifying sensitive periods for both risk and protection against late-life cognitive decline.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants in Kaptin (KPTN) cause KPTN-related disorder (KRD). KPTN modulates mTOR signaling activation within the KICSTOR complex in response to cellular amino acid levels. We define the clinical spectrum and investigate the developmental pathogenesis of KRD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We report the genotype and clinical phenotype of 71 KRD individuals (28 female subjects, ages 1 to 55 years) including 48 newly identified KRD individuals. The effects of Kptn knockout on brain development were assayed in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We defined 15 novel <i>KPTN</i> variants. Intellectual disability (ID) was identified in all KRD individuals. Macrocephaly and epilepsy were observed in 46% and 47%, respectively. Neuroimaging revealed megalencephaly but no overt structural abnormalities. Ketotic hypoglycemia and endocrinopathies were identified in KRD. Increased head size was detected in unaffected parents heterozygous for <i>KPTN</i> variants. Two KRD individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy were treated with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus but did not exhibit improved seizure control. CRISPR/Cas9 Kptn knockout in vitro induced mTOR activation and an mTOR-dependent increase in cell size. <i>Kptn−/−</i> mice exhibited increased cortical mTOR signaling that was reduced by rapamycin. Heterotopic neurons were identified in the subcortical white matter in the <i>Kptn −/−</i> mouse. Focal CRISPR/Cas9 Kptn knockout in cortex via in utero electroporation resulted in white matter heterotopic neurons. Electroencephalogram (EEG) did not detect ictal or inter-ictal abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>KRD is a multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder associated with ID, macrocephaly, epilepsy, mTOR signaling hyperactivation, and in a mouse model, subtle structural alterations in cerebral cortical cytoarchitecture. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background We explored the factors that influence the adoption of e-commerce and its link to digital purchasing decisions in indigenous Amazonian communities in Peru. Method A quantitative approach was applied, with a non-experimental design and explanatory scope, based on 301 people aged 18 to 35, residents of Bagua. Surveys were used to evaluate dimensions such as performance expectations, effort, social influence, facilitating conditions, means of payment, available technology, and product variety. Results The findings revealed low adoption of e-commerce associated with structural and sociocultural barriers, including lack of connectivity, limited technological knowledge, and limited training opportunities. Social influence and perceived usefulness were identified as key elements in promoting the use of digital platforms. Conclusion A significant association was found between technological access, product variety, and the decision to purchase digitally, suggesting the need for contextualised strategies that respect cultural identity and enhance local capacities as a way to promote a sustainable and inclusive digital transition in indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon.

                This narrative review examines how strategic decisions shaped by the entrepreneurial mindset sustain agribusiness SMEs in emerging economies, highlighting pathways to resilience. Recognising a critical knowledge gap in understanding the cognitive mechanisms that drive SME sustainability, the review is anchored in Entrepreneurial Cognition Theory and the Triple Bottom Line framework. The study synthesises empirical evidence from 2020 to 2025 using a qualitative research design with systematic data collection from peer-reviewed journals and grey literature. Findings indicate that entrepreneurial cognition guides strategic resource allocation, innovation adoption, market positioning, risk management, and the integration of social and environmental sustainability, collectively enhancing economic, social, and ecological resilience. Persistent challenges include structural constraints, unequal access to finance and technology, gender disparities, and sustainability trade-offs in niche markets. Policy and practical implications emphasise cooperative models, targeted innovation financing, market intelligence support, and incentives for sustainability-aligned practices. The review contributes empirically by consolidating evidence across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, offering comparative insights into how SMEs navigate complex and resource-constrained environments. Theoretically, it extends the application of Entrepreneurial Cognition Theory and the Triple Bottom Line framework to context-specific decision-making in agribusiness SMEs, demonstrating how cognitive processes underpin sustainable strategic actions. By linking entrepreneurial decision-making to resilience outcomes, the review provides actionable insights for policymakers, development partners, and SME owner-managers seeking to enhance competitiveness, long-term viability, and inclusive growth in emerging economies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70081?af=R">Spatial Organization of Morpho‐Electric Subtypes of Pyramidal Neuron in the Subiculum</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The subiculum is a main output structure of the hippocampus, transmitting information from the CA1 to the entorhinal cortex in a spatially structured manner. Prior studies revealed a high electrophysiological and molecular heterogeneity of subicular pyramidal neurons (PYNs) with evidence for further spatial subdivisions of the subiculum. In this study we focused on the cellular organization of the proximal to mid-distal part of the subiculum, designated as subregion 2 (Sub2) and performed a comprehensive electrophysiological and morphological characterization of PYNs by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings combined with intracellular labeling in acute rat hippocampal brain slices. Principal component analysis based on discharge pattern-related parameters and subsequent unsupervised, hierarchical clustering classified the PYNs into three subtypes: regular firing (RF), weak-bursting (WB), and strong-bursting (SB) neurons. Electrophysiological analysis revealed further differences between RF neurons and the two subtypes of bursting neurons in their active and passive properties. The three subtypes also showed differences in their morphometric features, including the apical and basal dendritic spread and branching pattern. Additionally, we identified a divergent morphological subset among RF neurons, bearing two apical dendrites. Mapping the three PYN subtypes onto the subiculum revealed specific spatial distributions along the superficial-deep and proximo-distal axes. Thus, this work maps the heterogeneity of subicular PYN onto differentially distributed subclasses in the Sub2 region with distinct physiological and morphological features. These findings together with prior observations of divergent anatomical projections from subicular subregions are pivotal for the understanding of how subicular morpho-electric neuron types relate to each other and contribute to processing and distribution of information to cortical regions from this hippocampal output region.</p>

                Background Gypseous soil exhibits significant collapsibility when saturated due to the dissolution of gypsum bonds, resulting in substantial reductions in shear strength and settlement problems. Understanding the influence of pile morphology on shaft resistance under these conditions is essential for constructing foundations in collapsible soils. The load-settlement behavior of the pile foundation can be established through an empirical pile loading test after preparing the soil and installing the piles in the model. Methods A physical model measuring 37×80×80 cm was constructed to assess the performance of three aluminum floating piles (square, circular, and rectangular) with identical cross-sectional areas, embedded in loose gypseous soil containing 58% gypsum and exhibiting a relative density of 30%. Pile load experiments with a constant rate of penetration (1 mm/min) were conducted under both dry and saturated conditions. Twelve methods were employed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity, including Davisson, De Beer, Brinch Hansen's 80% and 90%, Chin-Kondner, Decourt, and ASTM D-1143. Results Soaking caused a significant decrease in capacity; the ultimate load dropped by approximately 45-55% for the square pile, 55-60% for the rectangular pile, and 60-65% for the circular pile, depending on the interpretation method used. The Chin-Kondner method is notable among interpretation methods, providing the most consistent and accurate estimates of ultimate capacity in both dry and saturated conditions, with the lowest variability across shapes (coefficient of variability < 10%). Conclusions The shape of piles significantly influences load transfer in gypseous soils, especially when saturated. Square piles offer greater reliability and are less prone to strength loss due to collapse. In collapsible gypseous soils with high gypsum content, using square sections and Chin-Kondner interpretation is recommended for more accurate pile foundation design. Davisson's method provided the most conservative estimate of pile capacity among the twelve methods, particularly when saturated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-274/v1?src=rss">Decoding Market Voices: Beyond the Charts Analysis of Cryptocurrency Market Microstructure [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background As the financial markets are becoming increasingly complicated, there is a need to understand the evolving market microstructure landscape. While the existing research is well-focused on quantitative aspects of financial markets, qualitative aspects remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to explore the market microstructure of cryptocurrencies through a mixed-methodological approach. Methods By leveraging podcast analysis as primary data source, the study aims to uncover core thematic dimensions through techniques of lexicometry using Iramuteq. A total of 12 domain-specific podcasts are analyzed and processed in the study for descending hierarchical classification, resulting in five lexical clusters. These clusters are then subjected to factorial analysis using the Scikit-learn library in Python (v3.10). Results The descending hierarchical classification reveals five thematic clusters reflecting institutional infrastructure, market foundation, efficiency and resilience, forecasting and modelling dynamics, and market structure and efficiency. Followed by this, the factorial analysis discloses three dominant factors; market structure, forecasting models, and resilience mechanisms that shape the understanding of cryptocurrency market microstructure. The findings indicate that discussions on market microstructure of cryptocurrencies are multidimensional and are closely linked with both technological and regulatory developments. Conclusion The study contributes to literature by introducing a novel data source for qualitative finance research. The use of podcasts enhances the depth of extracted themes. Practitioners and academicians can gain updated insights on evolving market microstructure mechanisms for digital financial markets. The originality of this study lies in its unique approach, bridging top industry expert insights with quantitative techniques to offer a deeper understanding and future direction in market microstructure of cryptocurrencies.

                Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal, metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age. It can be induced by genetic, immunological, and environmental determinants. The main pathophysiology of PCOS, is hyperandrogenism, which can lead to acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, as well as infertility. However, PCOS is also associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. There was little study on the autoimmunity, like anti-FSH and anti-LH antibodies, of PCOS, so the current study was designed to test the effectiveness of these antibodies on the occurrence of PCOS. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the role of, (anti-FSH, and anti-LH antibodies, in PCOS occurrence). Methods About 65 patients with PCOS, and 56 healthy women (controls) were recruited. Their ages were 20-45 years. Body mass index (BMI) was computed as, (weight) divided by (height squared, (kg/m2). Blood samples were obtained randomly from the Medical City Hospital in Baghdad and private infertility clinics. This study was conducted between November 2024 and January 2025. The levels of anti-FSH and anti-LH antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results The results revealed a non-significant increase in anti-FSH antibody in patients (36.22±6.73) ng/ml, compared to controls (34.99±9.78 ng/ml), and a highly significant decrease in anti-LH antibody in patients (45.29±3.04 ng/ml), as compared to controls (69.16±10.90 ng/ml), (p<0.05). The fertility hormone, FSH showed a non-significant increase in unhealthy women (8.12±0.74 mIU/ml), in contrast to healthy women (7.35±0.62 mIU/ml) (p>0.05). While the LH hormone results was, in patients with PCOS (7.61±0.73 mIU/ml), as opposed to the control group, which was (5.62±0.56 mIU/ml), the (p>0.05). Finally, the LH/FSH ratio showed a non-significant increase in both patients (1.161±0.37) and controls (0.7819±0.22) (p>0.05). Conclusion Women with PCOS showed increased LH levels and the LH/FSH ratio. However, a decrease in anti-LH antibody was accompanied by an increase of LH hormone and LH/FSH ratio.

<p>This review offers a personal and historical perspective on spatial representations of the local environment in hippocampal regions CA1 and subiculum, as derived from extracellular electrophysiological recording of neurons in these regions in freely behaving rodents. I focus upon geometric responses and discrimination learning in CA1 place cells, and upon boundary vector cells, boundary-off cells, and vector trace cells in the subiculum. Vector trace cells are a type of boundary vector cell with an additional memory capability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-273/v1?src=rss">The Reflection of Cryptocurrencies Prices Volatility on US Financial Markets as a Factor in Investment Portfolio Optimization: An Experimental Study in The American Financial Markets [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical frameworks that define the nature of the relationship between cryptocurrencies and their volatility with the performance of financial market indices. It also aims to explain and analyze the mechanism of this potential influence on a sample of US financial markets for the period (2020-2024), by adopting the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) methodology introduced by (Pesaran et al., 2009) The research assessment results revealed the positive impact of Bitcoin and Tether on the performance of all US stock market indices, perhaps indicating that they act as an investment asset that supports financial market growth, especially in the long term. This suggests the possibility of considering Bitcoin and Tether as a guiding indicator for the performance of investment portfolios. In contrast, Ethereum's negative performance on all indices suggests investors may shift away from it to other currencies or traditional assets. This may be interpreted as a potential hedging tool during certain periods, making it a haven during adverse market conditions. This indicates - as the research suggested - the need to develop clearer regulatory frameworks that allow Bitcoin and Tether to be integrated alongside traditional investment products in investment portfolios.

                Xu et al. show that a developmental “switch” in the hypothalamus determines whether immature neurons become appetite suppressing or appetite stimulating. Disrupting this switch reshapes feeding behavior and protects mice from obesity, revealing how early-life programming shapes lifelong metabolic health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109447">Single molecule counting detects low-copy glycine receptors in hippocampal and striatal synapses</a></h4>

              
                Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord, where they regulate motor and sensory processes. GlyRs are clustered in the postsynaptic membrane by strong interactions of the β subunit with the scaffold protein gephyrin. Even though <i>Glrb</i> mRNA is highly expressed throughout the brain, the existence of synaptic GlyRs remains controversial as there is little conclusive evidence using conventional fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Here, we exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the presence of GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the brain, focusing on several areas of the telencephalon. Making use of a knock-in mouse model expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRβ, we identified few GlyRs in sub-regions of the hippocampus. Dual-colour SMLM revealed that these sparse receptors are integrated within the postsynaptic gephyrin domain, pointing to a possible role in maintaining the structural integrity of inhibitory synapses. In contrast, we found functionally relevant numbers of synaptic GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the ventral striatum. Our results highlight the strength of SMLM to detect few and sparsely distributed synaptic molecules in complex samples and to analyse their organisation with high spatial precision.

                Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values can be used to estimate the viral burden of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and predict population-level epidemic trends. We investigated the use of epidemic transmission modeling and machine learning (ML) based on Ct value distribution for SARS-CoV-2 incidence prediction in British Columbia, Canada during an Omicron subvariant BA.1-predominant period from November 2021 to January 2022. Using real-world data, we developed an epidemic transmission model that was first validated on outbreak data, and subsequently fitted to province-level data to predict incidence. Using simulated data, we developed a ML pipeline including five models to predict the reproductive number as a measure of transmission potential based on Ct value distribution, and validated it on out-of-sample province-level data. The epidemic transmission model demonstrated accurate prediction with the real incidence falling within the 95% credible interval of the predicted MCMC chains for both the long-term care facility outbreak, and province-level data. The ML models demonstrated good performance with a median mean squared error (MSE) lower than 0.17 across all models, and improved performance with increasing sample size. The variability of the Ct distribution around the mean was the strongest predictor of the reproductive number. These modeling approaches demonstrated utility for incidence and reproductive number prediction, and have potential to complement traditional surveillance in real time to guide public health interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108237">Adjoint propagation of error signal through modular recurrent neural networks for biologically plausible learning</a></h4>

              
                Biologically plausible learning mechanisms have implications for understanding brain functions and engineering intelligent systems. Inspired by the multi-scale recurrent connectivity in the brain, we introduce an adjoint propagation (AP) framework, in which the error signals arise naturally from recurrent dynamics and propagate concurrently with forward inference signals. AP inherits the modularity of multi-region recurrent neural network (MR-RNN) models and leverages the convergence properties of RNN modules to facilitate fast and scalable training. This framework eliminates the biologically implausible feedback required by the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, and allows concomitant error propagation for multiple tasks through the same RNN. We demonstrate that AP succeeds in training on standard benchmark tasks, achieving accuracies comparable to BP-trained networks while adhering to neurobiological constraints. The training process exhibits robustness, maintaining performance over extended training epochs. Importantly, AP supports flexible resource allocation for multiple cognitive tasks, consistent with observations in neuroscience. This framework bridges artificial and biological learning principles, paving the way for energy-efficient intelligent systems inspired by the brain and offering a mechanistic theory that can guide experimental investigations in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104543">Frictional instabilities as an alternative to friction coefficient in fine touch perception</a></h4>

              
                Fine touch perception is often correlated to material properties and friction coefficients, but the inherent variability of human motion has led to low correlations and contradictory findings. Instead, we hypothesized that humans use frictional instabilities to discriminate between objects. Here, we constructed a set of coated surfaces with minimal physical differences, but due to differences in surface chemistry, generated different types of instabilities depending on how quickly a finger is slid and pressed during sliding. In one experiment, we used a mechanical mock finger to quantify and classify differences in instability formation from different coated surfaces. In a second experiment, participants perform a discrimination task using the same coated surfaces. Using the data from these two experiments, we found that human discrimination response times were faster with surfaces where the mock finger produced more stiction spikes and discrimination accuracy was higher where the mock finger produced more steady sliding. Conversely, traditional metrics like surface roughness or average friction coefficient did not relate to tactile discriminability. In fact, the typical method of averaging friction coefficients led to a spurious correlation which erroneously suggests that distinct objects should feel identical and identical objects should feel distinct—similar to findings by others. Friction instabilities may offer a more predictive and tractable framework of fine touch perception than friction coefficients, which would accelerate the design of tactile interfaces.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109248">SETDB1 enables development beyond cleavage stages by extinguishing the MERVL-driven two-cell totipotency transcriptional program in the mouse embryo</a></h4>

              
                Loss of maternal SETDB1, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, leads to developmental arrest prior to implantation, with very few mouse embryos advancing beyond the eight-cell stage, which is currently unexplained. We genetically investigate SETDB1’s role in the epigenetic control of the transition from totipotency to pluripotency—a process demanding precise timing and forward directionality. Through single-embryo total RNA sequencing of two-cell and eight-cell embryos, we find that <i>Setdb1</i><sup>mat-/+</sup> embryos fail to extinguish one-cell and two-cell transient genes—alongside persistent expression of MERVL retroelements and MERVL-driven chimeric transcripts that define the totipotent state in mouse two-cell embryos. Comparative bioinformatics reveals that SETDB1 acts at MT2 LTRs and MERVL-driven chimeric transcripts, which normally acquire H3K9me3 during early development. The dysregulated targets substantially overlap with DUXBL-responsive genes, indicating a shared regulatory pathway for silencing the two-cell transcriptional program. We establish maternal SETDB1 as a critical chromatin regulator required to extinguish retroelement-driven totipotency networks and ensure successful preimplantation development.

">The diversity of lesion network mapping findings</a></h4>

              
                Lesion network mapping (LNM) has emerged as a popular framework to map the network mechanism of brain disorders using lesions and normative brain connectome (NBC). It was first demonstrated in neurological symptoms and was rapidly extended to a broad range of brain disorders in the past decade. A recent study by Van den Heuvel et al. questioned the methodological foundations of LNM. We here raise concerns regarding their errors and biases in the methodology and visualization. The conclusion of that study-LNM maps circumscribed brain changes mostly to one and the same outcome-is not supported by the data presented.

">Compound and sex specific medial prefrontal cortex rewiring after prenatal THC and CBD exposure</a></h4>

              
                The growing perception of cannabinoids as benign has increased perinatal exposure to both Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), yet their long term effects on prefrontal circuitry remain incompletely defined. Here we used whole cell and field electrophysiology in adult mice (P90-120) of both sexes to compare how in utero exposure to THC or CBD (GD5-18) remodels layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We quantified intrinsic excitability, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, the net E/I ratio, spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents kinetics, and canonical forms of synaptic plasticity (endocannabinoid mediated LTD and NMDA dependent LTP). Both cannabinoids shifted the adult mPFC toward a more pro excitatory state: the E/I ratio was altered in a compound and sex dependent manner, and endocannabinoid mediated LTD was abolished across groups. THC recapitulated previously reported deficits, producing male specific increases in intrinsic excitability and accelerating excitatory current kinetics in females, demonstrating a conserved cross species vulnerability of prefrontal circuits to gestational THC. CBD produced distinct signatures: female offspring showed marked increases in spontaneous excitatory event frequency and amplitude, indicating large scale reorganization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, while male offspring exhibited a selective and profound impairment of LTP. The combination of universal eLTD loss and CBD specific LTP impairment in males yields a bidirectional loss of plasticity: an emergent synaptic rigidity in which circuits are unable to potentiate or depress effectively. Together, these convergent and divergent effects establish that prenatal exposure to THC and CBD produces lasting, sex dependent rewiring of mPFC circuitry. Our results caution that the non intoxicating profile of CBD does not preclude durable developmental impact and underscore the importance of considering both compound identity and sex when assessing the neurodevelopmental risks of perinatal cannabinoid exposure.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning from outcomes can rely on distinct computational processes, but how internal motivational states shape these processes during visual perceptual learning (VPL) remains unclear. We investigated how fasting versus satiety modulates feedback processing during an orientation discrimination task with identical reward contingencies, using functional MRI. Both fasted and non-fasted participants showed significant VPL. However, only the fasted group exhibited enhanced post-error accuracy, reflecting increased sensitivity to error information without significantly greater net learning. At the neural level, whole-brain analyses revealed state-dependent dissociations: during fasting, decision-locked activity in the ventral striatum decreased from pre- to post-training, consistent with attenuated prediction-error signaling as outcomes became predictable, whereas under satiety, learning was accompanied by declining activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting reduced reliance on executive control. Region-of-interest analyses further showed that fasting selectively enhanced feedback-related responses to incorrect outcomes in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and primary visual cortex, and these error-related responses were associated with individual differences in perceptual improvement. Together, these results demonstrate that while VPL emerges under both motivational states, motivational state determines how learning is expressed, with fasting promoting error-sensitive, outcome-monitoring learning regime and satiety favoring a more control-driven mode of performance optimization.</span>

                This study aims to examine how psychological, cognitive, and contextual factors are associated with entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial action distinguishing between discovery and exploitation phases among university students in five Latin American countries. Using a cross-national design, the analysis combines non-parametric statistical techniques, correlation and regression models, and visual analytics through raincloud plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report focuses on those that showed significant cross-country differences or emerged as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in the discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase, whereas financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants of the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive entrepreneurship curricula that integrate emotional competencies, stage-specific training pathways, and institutional support strategies.

                The emergence of COVID-19 vaccines has reshaped the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic, offering hope for widespread immunity. Beyond conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2, these vaccines have exhibited intriguing immunomodulatory effects. This research explores the dynamic interplay among VDR mRNA expression levels, calcium (ionized and total), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations in individuals post-COVID-19 vaccination. The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and is closely intertwined with calcium homeostasis. This study investigates the hypothesis that COVID-19 vaccination may induce alterations in VDR mRNA expression, subsequently influencing calcium metabolism and iPTH secretion. Our findings reveal dynamic shifts in VDR mRNA expression following COVID-19 vaccination, with distinct patterns observed across individuals. Concurrently, we observe ionized and total calcium levels alterations, hinting at potential links between VDR activity and calcium metabolism post-vaccination. Furthermore, iPTH levels exhibit intriguing fluctuations, suggesting a regulatory role of VDR in parathyroid hormone secretion. The integration of clinical outcomes and vaccine response data sheds light on the significance of these molecular and biochemical alterations. This research underscores the multifaceted impact of COVID-19 vaccination on VDR mRNA expression, calcium homeostasis, and iPTH regulation. Beyond the scope of vaccination, our findings may bear implications for immunomodulation in various disease contexts, particularly in individuals with pre-existing calcium-related disorders. In conclusion, our study unveils the intricate relationships among VDR mRNA expression, calcium levels, and iPTH concentrations in the context of post-COVID-19 vaccination. These discoveries extend our understanding of vaccine-induced immunomodulation and may pave the way for personalized vaccination strategies, while also opening new avenues for investigating the role of VDR in immune responses and calcium regulation beyond the pandemic.

                Background The rising consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is a global concern, given their poor nutritional quality and the presence of multiple additives that may pose health risks when consumed in excess. Young populations are particularly vulnerable due to lifestyle habits and the widespread availability and accessibility of these products. The present study aimed to assess the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), taking into account the co-occurrence of additives and their association with risk factors in a young population. Methods A two-phase cross-sectional study was conducted. In the first phase, 500 ultra-processed food products available on the Peruvian market were analysed and classified into five groups: meat products, cereals, confectionery, dairy, and beverages, in order to identify the presence and frequency of additives. In the second phase, a structured survey was administered to 385 students, collecting data on UPF consumption over the previous 24 hours, along with variables related to lifestyle. Chi-square tests and ordinal logistic regression were used to analyse the associations. Results The categories with the highest levels of consumption were carbonated beverages (59.6%), meat products (54.7%), and dairy in various forms (66.3%). A high frequency of co-occurrence was identified between colourings and acidulants, particularly INS 133, INS 150d, and INS 339i. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between UPF consumption and male sex (OR = 1.603), as well as alcohol consumption (OR = 2.059), while age showed an inverse relationship (OR = 0.756). Other variables, such as physical activity and smoking, did not demonstrate a significant association. Conclusion It is concluded that excessive UPF consumption varies according to age and sex and represents a continuous source of exposure to food additives. In addition, a statistically significant association was observed between UPF consumption and alcohol consumption, which may indicate a relationship of relevance from a public health perspective; however, a causal relationship cannot be established.

                Background The accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste poses environmental and sustainability challenges due to its non-biodegradable nature and limited disposal options. Repurposing PET as aggregates in structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) offers a dual benefit of waste valorisation and conservation of natural resources, while supporting circular economy objectives. Methods Eight experimental mix proportions of SLWC were developed using a factorial design approach, with water–to–cement ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. PET aggregates were produced via thermal–mechanical processing and subjected to calcium hypochlorite treatment to improve surface bonding with cement paste. Standard tests were conducted to determine workability (Vebe time), fresh and dry densities, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and water absorption. Structural efficiency was also computed as a strength-to-weight performance indicator. Results The fresh and dry densities of the PET-based SLWC ranged from 1455–1515 kg/m3 and 1490–1537 kg/m3, respectively, corresponding to category D1.6 lightweight concrete. Compressive strengths ranged between 14.1 and 16.5 MPa, fulfilling the LC13 classification for structural applications. Splitting tensile strengths were between 0.84 and 1.4 MPa, with several mixes achieving minimum thresholds for structural performance. Water absorption values ranged from 4.66% to 10.16%, remaining within international standards for lightweight concrete durability. Workability was low (Vebe times 13–40 s), attributed to the angular and hydrophobic properties of PET aggregates. Structural efficiency values of 9.5–10.9 kPa·m3/kg exceeded minimum international requirements. Conclusions This study confirms that PET aggregates can be successfully utilised to produce structurally viable and durable lightweight concrete. Although workability is reduced, the compressive strength, tensile strength, density, and durability criteria align with international standards. These results demonstrate a sustainable strategy for PET waste valorisation in construction, contributing to resource conservation, reduced environmental burden, and advancement of circular economy goals.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, has increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-50/v2?src=rss">THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF APOCYNIN ON A SELENITE-INDUCED CATARACT MODEL [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introductıon The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of apocynin in a selenite-induced cataract model, and to evaluate its impact on cataract severity and antioxidant enzyme activities. Given the limited availability of pharmacological strategies to delay cataract progression, the identification of agents that modulate oxidative stress may provide translational insight for the development of future non-surgical approaches. Methods In this randomized experimental study, thirty-five rats were randomly separated into five groups (n = 7 per group). The control group received only saline. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were administered sodium selenite at a dose of 30 nmol/g. In addition, Group 2 received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Group 3 received 10 mg/kg apocynin, and Group 4 received 20 mg/kg apocynin. The apocynin treatment was administered intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. Cataract severity was defined as the primary outcome, while antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results Low-dose apocynin was seen to enhance antioxidant defence by increasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels (p = 0.003, p = 0.002) without altering malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (p = 0.04). High-dose apocynin (20 mg/kg) led to an increase in MDA, suggesting a possible dose-related pro-oxidant effect. Conclusion This study suggests that apocynin, particularly at a low dose (10 mg/kg), may prevent selenite-induced cataract formation. Low-dose apocynin effectively delayed cataract progression by enhancing antioxidant defence and limiting oxidative stress. In contrast, high-dose exposure revealed a possible pro-oxidant effect, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization.

                Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics, and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts are needed in the sequels which are playing a major role in verifying our major outcomes have been presented. Throughout this manuscript, ( X , ≼ ) indicates to a partially ordered set with the partially ordered ≼ . In this study, our main objective is to investigate and verify various new enhanced results of coupled fixed point theorems for continuous maps having the property of mixed monotone under the influence of extended contraction circumstances in the context of partially ordered D ∗ -complete metric spaces. Numerous characterizations of these types of coupled fixed point theorems have been verified. Additionally, an appropriate example that supports the major outcomes was prepared. Conclusions Our main results in this manuscript have been explored novel various outcomes related to the uniqueness of various coupled fixed point theorems for continuous maps having the property of mixed monotone under the influence of extended contraction circumstances in the context of partially ordered D ∗ -complete metric spaces. We predict that the discoveries in this study will aid scientists in enhancing the research on popularized partially ordered metric spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations.

                Background The derivation of novel biomarkers from biomedical data to accurately predict individual patient’s responses, would be an advance. We hypothesized that quantitative AI designed to analyze complex data, based on evolutionary computation, could identify algorithmic biomarkers from baseline data in a clinical trial, predictive of individual therapeutic responses. Methods A previously published randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo was analyzed. Baseline peripheral blood gene expression data, plus the treatment variable, infliximab or placebo, yielding 52,379 variables were available for 59 patients. The variable for analysis was a decrease in Disease Activity Score-28 (DSA28) score of 1.2. At 14 weeks, 20 of the 30 patients receiving infliximab had responded, and ten of the 29 patients receiving placebo had responded. Findings The AI derived a discovery algorithm, with 4 gene expression variables plus treatment assignment, that predicted responders versus non-responders for all 59 patients, with 100% accuracy. We present the discovery algorithm to enable transparent verification. Excluding the 4 gene expression variables, we then derived similarly accurate predictive algorithms with 4 other gene expression variables. We tested the hypothesis that the software could derive algorithms as predictors of treatment response applying just these 8 discovery gene expression variables to 6 previously published independent datasets. In each validation analysis, the accuracy of the algorithmic predictors surpassed those benchmarks previously reported, using a variety of analytic approaches. Conclusions AI based on evolutionary computation summarized a clinical trial, with transparent biomarker algorithms derived from baseline data, correctly predicting the outcome for all patients. The biomarker variables, validated in 6 independent cohorts, are now in development as a clinical test. This approach may expedite the discovery of companion diagnostics.

                Abstract* Background The purpose of this research is to compare regulations related to cyberbullying in Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan, and to explore digital citizenship as a long-term preventive measure. The phenomenon of cyberbullying is increasing in these three countries, becoming a serious challenge in the context of mental health and the protection of citizens in the digital age. Methods This research employs a methodological approach that combines juridical normative analysis with analytical and comparative research. It analyzes the laws of each country, starting from the Electronic Information and Transactions Law (ITE Law) in Indonesia, the Network Act in South Korea, and the Japanese Penal Code. Results The results of the study show that South Korea has the most comprehensive regulatory framework, encompassing both penal and non-penal approaches. At the same time, Japan excels in enforcing flexibility and protecting victims, even though it does not yet have a special constitution. On the other hand, Indonesia still faces weaknesses in its legal framework, as there is no explicit definition, and reactive approaches are still emerging. Conclusions Research highlights the importance of adaptive legal reform in dynamic technological environments and recommends integrating digital citizenship into national curricula to prevent cyberbullying. Implementing the nine elements of digital citizenship, according to Ribble, involves being a framework-relevant work in the form of ethical and responsible digital citizens who are aware of the law.

                Background The Transportation Problem (TP) is a detailed model in operations study with applications in logistics, supply chain management, and resource allocation. The classical IBFS methods including North-West Corner, Least Cost and Vogel’s Approximation have competitive computational efficiency, but they are very sensitive to the structure of the problem and usually lead to a solution that is far from the global optimum. Classic enhancement strategies like the Generalized Distribution (MODI) and Stepping-Stone (SS) approaches have low computational complexity but may fall into a local optimum quickly, which makes them ineffective in large-scale or unbalanced problems. Methods We propose the first generic hybrid algorithm, called Ester Hybrid Improvement for Transportation Problem (EHITP), which was developed with the aim of mitigating the shortcomings of traditional IBFS-based methods. To overcome the local minima problem, the proposed EHITP framework combines adaptive perturbation procedures and guided neighborhood search methodologies to broaden the solution space. Results Initial experiments on benchmark and synthetically created datasets show that EHITP obtains a much less total transportation cost relative to the classical IBFS and improved MODI/SS methods. These features lead to a more robust method, stable solutions over iterations, and convergence across a wider range of problem sizes and structures. Conclusions The findings show EHITP serves as a more reliable, scalable, and expense-effective solution to transportation issues. The balance this algorithm achieves between the quality of the solution it produces, and its computational efficiency makes it a potential candidate for real life applications in topics such as distribution chain and economic resource allocation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-262/v1?src=rss">Improving the characteristics of mozzarella cheese manufactured in an unconventional way and fortified with nanosalt and studying the effect of freezing on it [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Mozzarella cheese is a soft, moisture-rich cheese that is highly sensitive to storage conditions, impacting its physical and chemical properties. By salting mozzarella cheese with nanosalt and comparing it to chilling and freezing, this study aimed to improve its physicochemical and sensory properties. Methods By milling, nanosodium chloride was created. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze shape and structure. Citric acid was added to samples of mozzarella cheese made from cow’s milk. A cooled control (T1), a frozen sample (T2), with 0.5% nanosalt added (T3), 1% nanosalt added (T4), and 1.5% nanosalt added (T5) comprised the five groups of samples. Changes in moisture, protein and fat contents, pH, acidity, ash content, and sensory assessment were all measured in the samples. Results From electron microscopy show the presence of sodium chloride, with tiny nanoparticles exhibiting irregular and sometimes cubic shapes. The samples ranged in dimensions from 36.99 nm to 70.59 nm. Chemical tests on mozzarella cheese stored under various conditions showed significant differences (p≤0.05) in moisture content (52.74% vs. 49.91%) and ash content (2.99% vs. 3.89%). The protein content varied between 25.00% and 25.90% across treatments, remaining unchanged. Fat percentage, pH and acidity measurements showed no significant differences between the treatments. Sensory analysis of the mozzarella cheese samples that were preserved using various techniques revealed that the samples’ sensory qualities were maintained within reasonable bounds for the duration of storage. No differences in appearance, opening, or color were found, confirming these traits are stable. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in taste, texture, and flavour were found, with the largest in T3–T5 where nanosalt was added, showing its positive impact on sensory quality versus cooling and freezing alone. The weight reduction effects for mozzarella cheese varied significantly (p≤0.05) between the treatments (T1-T5) after 21 days, with values ranging from 26.95 to 92.50. Treatment T5 produced the least amount of weight loss when compared to the other treatments. Conclusion Adding nanosalt to mozzarella cheese formulations enhances quality, shelf life, and resistance to freezing flaws, while maintaining sensory and textural qualities and offering a valuable alternative for traditional preservation methods.

                This paper presents a systematic investigation of a newly defined comprehensive subclass of analytic and univalent functions in the open unit disk. The introduced function class constitutes a broad generalization that incorporates several significant families, particularly Yamaguchi functions and starlike functions, which themselves exhibit fundamental properties within the established Bazilevič function hierarchy. The formal construction of this class employs the Ma-Minda framework through the application of subordination principles, set-theoretic operations, and analytical formulations involving infinite series and product combinations of specific geometric expressions. The principal contributions of this work include the derivation of sharp coefficient bounds, complete solutions for the Fekete-Szegö problem with parameters, and precise estimates for Hankel determinants containing a real parameter. The proposed class demonstrates remarkable generality, as it systematically reduces to numerous well-established function classes when its parameters are specialized to particular values within their defined domains, thereby providing a unified approach to studying these classical families.

                Background Bootstrap resampling is used throughout biology to perform critical statistical tasks, including estimating confidence intervals as part of statistical inference and learning. A key assumption of bootstrap resampling is that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), but this assumption is at odds with the inherently sequential nature of biomolecular sequences. To relax this simplifying assumption, RAWR (“RAndom Walk Resampling”) was introduced as a technique for sequence-aware statistical resampling. RAWR has been applied to several different biomolecular sequence analysis tasks to date, including phylo- genetic tree support estimation. In each of these tasks, RAWR produces comparable or superior results to the bootstrap method and state-of-the-art resampling methods. Methods and Results A comprehensive software suite for RAWR resampling of unaligned biomolecular sequence data has been developed. Version 1.0 of the distribution focuses on two essential applications in computational biology and bioinformatics: (1) phylogenetic support estimation and (2) estimating confidence intervals on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The software implementation includes a local Galaxy client, a desktop PC client with a graphical user interface (GUI), and a standalone web server application. Access to software library functionality is provided via a developer-friendly application programming interface (API). User and developer documentation and tutorials are also provided. Availability and Implementation The software suite, documentation, and tutorials are publicly available under an open-source copyleft license at https://github.com/kjl-msu/RAWR-web-software. The software and API are implemented in Python for use on macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

                Abstract: Considering the accelerating digital transformation, organizations are increasingly relying on digital technologies to enhance customer experience, boost satisfaction and loyalty, and build a positive brand image. Websites are among the most important digital interaction channels influencing customer behavior, particularly in the banking sector. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between website quality and Electronic loyalty (EL), while also examining the mediating role of customer knowledge management (CKM). Despite the increasing number of studies examining website quality and its role in enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, most of these studies have focused on the direct relationship between website quality and EL, neglecting the explanatory role of mediating variables, particularly customer knowledge management. Furthermore, previous literature has rarely addressed this topic within the context of banking institutions in developing countries, and more specifically within the Iraqi environment, which is characterized by distinct regulatory and technological features. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing the relationship between website quality and EL, while also examining the mediating role of CKM in the Iraqi banking sector. To achieve this objective, a descriptive-analytical approach was adopted, and the study was applied to Al-Rafidain Bank in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM). The analysis revealed significant correlations and influences between website quality and EL. The results also indicated that CKM plays a mediating role in strengthening this relationship, highlighting its importance in explaining online customer behavior. The study concludes that improving website quality, along with adopting effective CKM practices, contributes to enhancing EL in the banking sector. The findings also provide theoretical and practical insights that can support decision-makers in developing more effective digital strategies.

                As the global population ages, creating supportive environments for walking is a priority for public health and urban planning. While empirical studies are numerous, there is a lack of synthesized knowledge regarding the underlying theoretical constructs used to understand these environments. This systematic literature review examines the theoretical frameworks and conceptual models that define the relationship between the built environment and walking behaviors of older adults. Specifically, it explores the antecedents within these models that influence walkability. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted focusing on publications that present or utilize theoretical frameworks for older adult walkability. Papers were analyzed based on their research focus categorized into model development, testing, advancement, or integration and their contribution type to the field. The review identifies a range of theoretical approaches, examining dominant theoretical frameworks within the Built Environment for Walkability (BEW) and its social and policy extensions. Findings suggest that while many models are described as “holistic,” they vary significantly in how they weigh individual, social, and environmental factors. The analysis highlights a shift toward model integration as a means to address the multi-dimensional nature of aged-friendly environments. By focusing on theoretical antecedents rather than purely empirical outcomes, this review provides a roadmap for future research to refine existing models. It emphasizes the need for a more consistent definition of the socio-built environment to better support the mobility of older populations.

                Background insomnia is common at any age; however, it is more prevalent among medical students due to the competitive environment they live. Stress is thought to be a primary contributor in the development of insomnia due to its two-way relationship with the disorder. The objective of this study is to assess sleep quality among medical students and explore the relation between insomnia and the level of stress they experience. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students from Anbar and Fallujah universities in Anbar province/Iraq. All students who agreed to participate were included in the study. The presence of insomnia was evaluated according to the Athens insomnia scale (AIS-8). The level of stress was measured according to the perceived stress scale (PSS-10). Results The total number of participants was 452, 72.8% of whom reported insomnia. Low-stress level was experienced by 8.4%, moderate stress by 60.0%, and high perceived stress by 31.6% of the respondents. Level of stress was significantly associated with gender (p< 0.001), with prevalence of insomnia among females (42.5%) been higher than that among males (30.3%). Logistic regression model revealed that students with high perceived stress had OR of 3.188 for insomnia compared to those with low level of stress (C.I. 2.1-4.8, P<0.001). Conclusion Prevalence of insomnia among medical students is high, statistically attributed to stress. The findings of the study encourage adopting certain programs to enhance awareness of medical students about this problem.

                Background Orthognathic surgery corrects severe skeletal discrepancies that cannot be addressed by orthodontics alone. With advancements in digital workflows and CAD/CAM technologies, clear aligner therapy (CAT) has emerged as a potential adjunct in surgical cases. However, its clinical application remains under-researched. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, experience, and attitudes of orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in Saudi Arabia regarding CAT in orthognathic surgery patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 1 to May 31, 2023, using a closed-ended online questionnaire distributed to specialists across Saudi Arabia. The survey gathered demographic and clinical data. Statistical analysis included descriptive methods, chi-square testing (p < 0.05), and univariate regression to identify demographic predictors of CAT use. Results Out of 278 expected responses, 46 (16.5%) were received. Most participants were aged 31–40 years (p < 0.05) and had 6–10 years of experience (p = 0.03). Orthodontists accounted for 65.2% of the respondents, with oral and maxillofacial surgeons at 34.8% (p = 0.03). While most treated 1–4 orthognathic patients monthly, 80% had no experience using CAT in these cases. Although general CAT usage was significant (p < 0.05), its clinical application in orthognathic surgery was minimal. Challenges included pre-surgical alignment, intraoperative fixation, and post-operative occlusion control. Regression analysis showed that age was significantly associated with CAT use (p < 0.05; R2 = 0.38), while gender and experience were not. Conclusion The study indicates limited clinical experience with CAT in orthognathic surgery in Saudi Arabia. Age may influence CAT adoption, but further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and inform future integration of aligner protocols in surgical orthodontics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-257/v1?src=rss">Integrative Healthcare for Optimal Health [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Conventional medicine and public health have collectively improved health and saved the lives of millions. Yet, as we confront the escalating crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it becomes increasingly clear that conventional approaches alone are no longer sufficient. A new, evidence-based paradigm shift is necessary. Integrative health, which combines conventional medicine with complementary and lifestyle medicine, offers that shift. To assess its effectiveness, we identified and reviewed 14 clinical trials published within the past 5 years in widely read, high-impact factor journals (and their sub-specialty counterparts) – including The New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet, the BMJ and JAMA. These trials directly compared integrative health interventions with conventional medical treatments across conditions such as insomnia, obesity, age-related disorders, Parkinsonism, and motor neuron disease. The included trials assessed outcomes related to mental health, pain management, and quality of life. Across these studies, we found that integrative health interventions were consistently associated with improved health outcomes. While we acknowledge that stronger evidence is needed, the research findings represent an important step toward exploring a well-balanced, evidence-based approach to integrative health.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Object recognition memory (ORM) plays a key role in identifying familiar items and encoding episodic information. ORM consolidation depends on β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) signaling and is associated with increased BDNF expression in the dorsal hippocampus. Although hippocampal activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) is known to impair ORM consolidation, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In this study, we used the novel object recognition task to examine the interaction between CB1Rs and βARs during ORM consolidation in adult male Wistar rats. Intra-dorsal CA1 infusion of the CB1R agonist ACEA, the βAR antagonist propranolol, or the PKA inhibitor myristoylated PKI<sub>14–22</sub>, administered 5-min post-training, impaired ORM consolidation. Notably, co-administration of the PKA activator 8Br-cAMP or the βAR agonist isoproterenol reversed ACEA-induced amnesia. In contrast, the CB1R inverse agonist AM251 failed to reverse propranolol-induced amnesia, which was instead rescued by recombinant BDNF infusion into the hippocampus 120-min post-training. These findings suggest that hippocampal CB1Rs regulate ORM consolidation by acting upstream of βARs via a signaling cascade involving PKA activation and BDNF expression.</p>

Scientific data management is at a critical juncture, driven by exponential data growth, increasing cross-domain dependencies, and a severe reproducibility crisis in modern research. Traditional centralized data management approaches are not only struggling with data volume but also fail to address the fragmentation of research results across domains. This hinders scientific reproducibility and cross-domain collaboration and increases concerns about data sovereignty and governance. This article proposes FAIR and federated Data Ecosystems as an improved architectural pattern for future research data ecosystems. It tries to incorporate the latest advancements in decentralized, distributed systems into existing research infrastructure to promote cross-domain collaboration. Based on established patterns from Data Commons, Data Meshes, and Data Spaces, our approach focuses on a layered architecture that consists of governance, data, service, and application layers. With this, it could be possible to preserve domain-specific expertise and control while facilitating data integration through standardized interfaces and semantic enrichment. Key requirements include adaptive metadata management, simplified user interaction, robust security, and transparent data transactions. Our architecture supports compute-to-data as well as data-to-compute paradigms, implementing a decentralized peer-to-peer network that scales horizontally. This article aims to provide both an impulse for the technical architecture as well as concepts for a governance framework so that FAIR and federated Data Ecosystems could enable researchers to build on existing work while maintaining control over their data and computing resources. This could provide a practical path towards an integrated research infrastructure that respects domain autonomy as well as interoperability requirements.

Despite decades of intensive research, our current approaches to treating neurodegenerative diseases only slow down the seemingly inevitable. Could recent data associating vaccinations with reduced risk of dementia offer an unexpected beacon of hope?

Current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases largely manage symptoms and only modestly slow progression. This Perspective highlights emerging evidence that vaccines and antivirals may lower dementia risk by targeting viral triggers, opening new avenues for prevention.

                <p>by Pietro Pollo, Szymon M. Drobniak, Hamed Haselimashhadi, Malgorzata Lagisz, Ayumi Mizuno, Laura A. B. Wilson, Daniel W. A. Noble, Shinichi Nakagawa</p>

Biological differences between males and females are pervasive. Researchers often focus on sex differences in the mean or, occasionally, in variation, albeit other measures can be useful for biomedical and biological research. For instance, differences in skewness (asymmetry of a distribution), kurtosis (heaviness of a distribution’s tails), and correlation (relationship between two variables) might be crucial to improve medical diagnosis and to understand natural processes. Yet, there are currently no meta-analytic ways to measure differences in these metrics between two groups. We propose three effect size statistics to fill this gap: Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i>, which measure differences in skewness, kurtosis, and correlation, respectively. Besides presenting the rationale for the calculation of these effect size statistics, we conducted a simulation to explore their properties and used a large dataset of mice traits to illustrate their potential. For example, in our case study, we found that females show, on average, a greater correlation between fat mass and heart weight than males. Although calculating Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i> will require large sample sizes of individual data, technological advancements in data collection create increase opportunities to use these effect size statistics. Importantly, Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i> can be used to compare any two groups, allowing a new generation of meta-analyses that explore such differences and potentially leading to new insights in multiple fields of study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-256/v1?src=rss">Comparative outcomes of partial versus total adrenalectomy in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Total adrenalectomy (TA) is the standard approach for the management of unilateral adrenal tumors. However, TA leads to adrenal insufficiency requiring corticosteroid replacement therapy, which may cause complications such as adrenal crisis, Cushing syndrome, obesity, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular disease. Partial adrenalectomy (PA) was then performed to preserve residual adrenal function and minimize the need for lifelong corticosteroid therapy. In unilateral adrenal tumors, higher recurrence rates with PA than with TA need to be considered. Given the variability in outcomes, a systematic review is needed to compare the outcomes of PA and TA in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors. Methods We searched the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2025. We used specific keywords, such as “partial adrenalectomy,” “total adrenalectomy,” and “unilateral adrenal tumor.” Three authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the ROBINS-I. The primary outcomes included the operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were overall complications, hypertension, hypokalemia, and local recurrence. Results Eight studies involving 982 patients with unilateral adrenal tumors (adrenal adenoma, adrenal pheochromocytoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and other pathologies) were included. Partial adrenalectomy resulted in a significant reduction in hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -0.49 days; 95% CI −0.78 to −0.21; I2 = 0%; p = 0,0006). There were no statistically significant differences in operative time, blood loss, overall complications, postoperative hypertension and hypokalemia, or recurrence between the TA and PA. Conclusions Partial adrenalectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay than total adrenalectomy in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors. Some outcomes showed high heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-254/v1?src=rss">Hepatitis C virus infection as a six-fold risk factor for hemostatic complications following arteriovenous fistula creation in end-stage renal disease: A seven-year prospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection demonstrates significantly elevated prevalence among hemodialysis populations worldwide, with particularly high rates in Middle Eastern countries. Despite this epidemiological pattern, limited evidence exists regarding the impact of HCV infection on hemostatic complications following arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods This prospective cohort study enrolled 460 patients diagnosed with ESRD requiring AVF creation at three tertiary hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq (Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital, Ibn-Al-Nafees Teaching Hospital, and Al-Shaheed Ghazi Al-Hariri Surgical Hospital), between January 2017 and January 2024. Patients were stratified by HCV serological status using third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome was hemostatic complications (bleeding requiring intervention or clinically significant hematoma) monitored for six weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included coagulation parameters, AVF maturation rates, and other vascular complications. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of complications. Results Among 460 patients, 151 (32.8%) tested positive for HCV. HCV-positive patients demonstrated significantly prolonged prothrombin time (19±5 versus 15±2.5 seconds, p<0.001), activated partial thromboplastin time (40±4 versus 32±3 seconds, p<0.001), and reduced platelet count (153±43 versus 215±72 ×103/mm3, p<0.001). Hemostatic complications occurred in 28.5% of HCV-positive patients compared to 5.5% of HCV-negative patients (crude OR: 6.835, 95% CI: 3.597-12.987, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HCV infection emerged as the strongest independent predictor of hemostatic complications (adjusted OR: 5.892, 95% CI: 3.102-11.196, p<0.001). AVF maturation rates were significantly lower in HCV-positive patients (74.2% versus 86.4%, p=0.002). Conclusions Hepatitis C virus infection increases hemostatic complications following AVF creation nearly six-fold and adversely affects fistula maturation rates. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating HCV status into preoperative risk stratification and perioperative management protocols, particularly in high-prevalence regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-253/v1?src=rss">Socio-economic Conditions & Determinants of Income: A Tell of Informal Workers of Urban Odisha, India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Informal employment and its impact on economic growth have been receiving greater attention, but less is known about their socioeconomic conditions and determinants of income in India. This column attempts to uncover the determinants of informal income and socioeconomic conditions with respect to migration status. Methods This study was based on primary investigation. Hence the data collection was performed on multi-stage stratified sampling method. The primary data has been collected through a structured questionnaire for the informal sector workers in Cuttack city of Odisha. The data analysis was completed by ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Results The income of migrant workers is more than the non-migrant workers due to their nature of work and pattern of payment, whereas the non-migrant workers are engaged in household services with lower payment. The important socio economic determinants such as category of land they lived, gender, various age groups of household head, migration status, availability of off-season support, type of employment, social group, religion, principal sectors, number of dependency, and members of the union are responsible for lower income of the informal workers. Conclusion For sustainable and equitable improvements in basic facilities such as housing, electricity, health, vocational education, social security and employment opportunity should be facilitated by the policy makers. In order to achieve these objectives, this study emphasized more on the mobile-education-services, MGNREGS programs and the MSMEs sector by which Sustainable Development Goals 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12, and 17 can simultaneously be achieved.

<p>This introduction is for the second installment of the special issue on Scientific Histories of Hippocampal Research, with 13 new articles. Part 2 adds to the 24 articles in Part 1, and we expect a third installment in the future. The different parts of this special issue contain articles from authors directly involved in pioneering research on the hippocampus ranging from electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity to analyses of cellular mechanisms for synaptic plasticity, to behavioral studies of the effects of hippocampal lesions. The authors were specifically invited to provide first person historical descriptions of important research and discoveries concerning hippocampal function, and were encouraged to include information about how their background and training influenced their research. In this introduction to Part 2, we will briefly review some of the main themes discussed in Part 2, which builds on many of the same themes as the articles in Part 1.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The taiep rat originated from a spontaneous mutation in a colony of Sprague–Dawley rats, whose phenotype is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The mutant taiep rat shows hypomyelination and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) and has been considered a chronic animal model of multiple sclerosis and tubulinopathies. Unlike taiep rats, heterozygous rats for the mutation (+/−), referred to as carriers, have not been widely studied. Thus, the objective of the present study was to examine the dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of taiep mutation carriers. We evaluated the following groups: Sprague–Dawley rats as a control (SD), mutation carriers (Carrier), and taiep rats (taiep). The brains of the animals were processed using the Golgi-Cox technique to analyze the basilar and apical dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. We observed a decrease in dendritic arborization in the basilar arbors of dorsal hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in both carrier and taiep adult rats, as well as a decrease in dendritic arborization in the apical arbors of CA3 neurons in carrier rats. Moreover, dendritic spine density was reduced in CA1 neurons in both rats. These results show that even when rats are mutation carriers, they exhibit alterations in the dendritic arborization of dorsal hippocampal neurons similar to those of taiep rats.</p>
