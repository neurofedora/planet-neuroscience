                Syntaxin helps in catalyzing membrane fusion during exocytosis. It also forms clusters in the plasma membrane, where both its transmembrane and SNARE domains are thought to homo-oligomerize. To study syntaxin clustering in live PC12 cells, we labeled granules with neuropeptide-Y-mCherry and syntaxin clusters with syntaxin-1a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Abundant...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent technological advances have enabled neural recordings consisting of hundreds to thousands of channels. As the pace of these developments continues to grow rapidly, it is imperative to have fast, flexible tools supporting the analysis of neural data gathered by such large-scale modalities. Here we introduce GhostiPy (<b>g</b>eneral <b>h</b>ub <b>o</b>f <b>s</b>pectral <b>t</b>echniques <b>i</b>n <b>Py</b>thon), a Python open source software toolbox implementing various signal processing and spectral analyses including optimal digital filters and time&ndash;frequency transforms. GhostiPy prioritizes performance and efficiency by using parallelized, blocked algorithms. As a result, it is able to outperform commercial software in both time and space complexity for high-channel count data and can handle out-of-core computation in a user-friendly manner. Overall, our software suite reduces frequently encountered bottlenecks in the experimental pipeline, and we believe this toolset will enhance both the portability and scalability of neural data analysis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Muscle Spindle Feedback in the Guidance of Hindlimb Movement by the Ipsilateral Forelimb during Locomotion in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Safe and efficient locomotion relies on placing the foot on a reliable surface at the end of each leg swing movement. Visual information has been shown to be important for determining the location of foot placement in humans during walking when precision is required. Yet in quadrupedal animals where the hindlimbs are outside of the visual field, such as in mice, the mechanisms by which precise foot placement is achieved remain unclear. Here we show that the placement of the hindlimb paw is determined by the position of the forelimb paw during normal locomotion and in the presence of perturbations. When a perturbation elicits a stumbling corrective reaction, we found that the forelimb paw shifts posteriorly relative to body at the end of stance, and this spatial shift is echoed in hindlimb paw placement at the end of the swing movement. Using a mutant mouse line in which muscle spindle feedback is selectively removed, we show that this posterior shift of paw placement is dependent on muscle spindle feedback in the hindlimb but not in the forelimb. These findings uncover a neuronal mechanism that is independent of vision to ensure safe locomotion during perturbation. This mechanism adds to our general knowledge of how the nervous system controls targeted limb movements and could inform the development of autonomous walking machines.</p>

                The common, or spectacled, caiman Caiman crocodilus is an abundant, widely distributed Neotropical crocodilian exhibiting notable morphological and molecular diversification. The species also accounts by far for the largest share of crocodilian hides on the global market, with the C. crocodilus hide trade alone valued at about US$86.5 million per year. We obtained 239,911,946 paired-end reads comprising approximately 72 G bases using IlluminaTM sequencing of tissue sampled from a single Caiman crocodilus individual. These reads were de-novo assembled and progressively aligned against the genomes of increasingly related crocodilians; liftoff was used to annotate the draft C. crocodilus genome assembly based on an Alligator mississipiensis (a confamilial species) annotation. The draft assembly has been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information and both assembly and annotation are currently available for review at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4755063

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Observable variations in human sex ratio at birth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanan Long, Qi Chen, Henrik Larsson, Andrey Rzhetsky</p>

The human sex ratio at birth (SRB), defined as the ratio between the number of newborn boys to the total number of newborns, is typically slightly greater than 1/2 (more boys than girls) and tends to vary across different geographical regions and time periods. In this large-scale study, we sought to validate previously-reported associations and test new hypotheses using statistical analysis of two very large datasets incorporating electronic medical records (EMRs). One of the datasets represents over half (∼ 150 million) of the US population for over 8 years (IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claims) while another covers the entire Swedish population (∼ 9 million) for over 30 years (the Swedish National Patient Register). After testing more than 100 hypotheses, we showed that neither dataset supported models in which the SRB changed seasonally or in response to variations in ambient temperature. However, increased levels of a diverse array of air and water pollutants, were associated with lower SRBs, including increased levels of industrial and agricultural activity, which served as proxies for water pollution. Moreover, some exogenous factors generally considered to be environmental toxins turned out to induce higher SRBs. Finally, we identified new factors with signals for either higher or lower SRBs. In all cases, the effect sizes were modest but highly statistically significant owing to the large sizes of the two datasets. We suggest that while it was unlikely that the associations have arisen from sex-specific selection mechanisms, they are still useful for the purpose of public health surveillance if they can be corroborated by empirical evidences.

                <p>Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by JC virus (JCV), which occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Management of PML relies on restoration of immunity within the CNS. However, when this restoration cannot be readily achieved, PML has a grim prognosis. Innovative strategies have shown promise in promoting anti-JCV immune responses, and include T-cell adoptive transfer or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Conversely, management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, particularly in iatrogenic PML, remains a major challenge. In this paper, we review recent development in the treatment of PML.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and whether this association differs after risk stratification based on the Age, Blood Pressure, Clinical Features, Duration of Symptoms, Diabetes (ABCD<sup>2</sup>) score.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>INSPiRE-TMS was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with minor stroke or TIA to an intensified support program or conventional care. In this post hoc analysis, participants were categorized using hs-cTnT levels (5th generation; Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany; 99th percentile upper reference limit [URL] = 14ng/l). Vascular risk was stratified using the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score (lower risk = 0–5 vs higher risk = 6–7). Cox proportional hazard regression was performed using covariate adjustment and propensity score matching (PSM) for the association between hs-cTnT and MACE (stroke/nonfatal coronary event/vascular death).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 889 patients (mean age = 70 years, 37% female), MACE occurred in 153 patients (17.2%) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. hs-cTnT was associated with MACE (9.3%/yr, &gt;URL vs 4.4%/yr, ≤URL, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–2.35], adjusted HR [Q<sub>4</sub> vs Q<sub>1</sub>] = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.35–4.97], adjusted HR [log-transformed] = 2.31 [95% CI = 1.37–3.89]). This association remained after PSM (adjusted HR = 1.76 [95% CI = 1.14–2.72]). There was a significant interaction between hs-cTnT and ABCD<sup>2</sup> category for MACE occurrence (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.04). In the lower risk category, MACE rate was 9.5%/yr in patients with hs-cTnT &gt; URL, which was higher than in those ≤URL (3.8%/yr) and similar to the overall rate in the higher risk category.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with incident MACE within 3 years after minor stroke or TIA and may help to identify high-risk individuals otherwise deemed at lower risk based on the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score. If confirmed in independent validation studies, this might warrant intensified secondary prevention measures and cardiac diagnostics in stroke patients with elevated hs-cTnT.

                <p>Younger adults with epilepsy have an increased mortality. Some deaths are seizure-related, for example, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), whereas others, for example, suicide, have multiple causes, including adverse effects of the treatment on mood. In this retrospective population-based study of all Danish persons with epilepsy aged 18 to 49 years during 2007 to 2009 we evaluated the risk of death from seizures and suicide. SUDEP comprised 82.7% of all seizure-related death. Younger adults with epilepsy had an 8.3-fold increased risk of death from seizure-related causes compared with suicide. This underpins the importance of effective seizure control in preventing premature death. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:983–987</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Hydroxychloroquine for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-arm, phase II futility trial of 200 mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18 months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary end point was ≥20% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18 months of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon 2-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary end point, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18 months. HCQ was overall well-tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:940–948</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparative Effectiveness of Stereotactic Electroencephalography Versus Subdural Grids in Epilepsy Surgery</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to compare the outcomes of subdural electrode (SDE) implantations versus stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG), the 2 predominant methods of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) performed in difficult-to-localize drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy created an international registry of iEEG patients implanted between 2005 and 2019 with ≥1 year of follow-up. We used propensity score matching to control exposure selection bias and generate comparable cohorts. Study endpoints were: (1) likelihood of resection after iEEG; (2) seizure freedom at last follow-up; and (3) complications (composite of postoperative infection, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or permanent neurological deficit).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten study sites from 7 countries and 3 continents contributed 2,012 patients, including 1,468 (73%) eligible for analysis (526 SDE and 942 SEEG), of whom 988 (67%) underwent subsequent resection. Propensity score matching improved covariate balance between exposure groups for all analyses. Propensity-matched patients who underwent SDE had higher odds of subsequent resective surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 1.84) and higher odds of complications (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.34, 3.74; unadjusted: 9.6% after SDE vs 3.3% after SEEG). Odds of seizure freedom in propensity-matched resected patients were 1.66 times higher (95% CI 1.21, 2.26) for SEEG compared with SDE (unadjusted: 55% seizure free after SEEG-guided resections vs 41% after SDE).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In comparison to SEEG, SDE evaluations are more likely to lead to brain surgery in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy but have more surgical complications and lower probability of seizure freedom. This comparative-effectiveness study provides the highest feasible evidence level to guide decisions on iEEG. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:927–939</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Impact of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Neurogenesis and Cortical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three-week-old piglets (n = 29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60 minutes) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60 minutes). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:913–926</p>

                <p>Difficulty retrieving proper names is common in older adults, coinciding with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in mid-life. We investigated the ability of healthy older adults to retrieve the names of famous faces in relation to positron emission tomography measurements of amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐Term Cognitive Outcome in Anti–N‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive function, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, subjective complaints, and depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in &gt;80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in two thirds of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median modified Rankin Scale = 1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time dependent, with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, although improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as an outcome measure in future clinical studies. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:949–961</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The majority of patients with a familial cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) referred for molecular screening do not show pathogenic variants in known genes. In this study, we aimed to identify novel CSVD causal genes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a gene-based collapsing test of rare protein-truncating variants identified in exome data of 258 unrelated CSVD patients of an ethnically matched control cohort and of 2 publicly available large-scale databases, gnomAD and TOPMed. Western blotting was used to investigate the functional consequences of variants. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of mutated patients were characterized.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that <i>LAMB1</i> truncating variants escaping nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay are strongly overrepresented in CSVD patients, reaching genome-wide significance (<i>p</i> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). Using 2 antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal parts of LAMB1, we showed that truncated forms of LAMB1 are expressed in the endogenous fibroblasts of patients and trapped in the cytosol. These variants are associated with a novel phenotype characterized by the association of a hippocampal type episodic memory defect and a diffuse vascular leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings are important for diagnosis and clinical care, to avoid unnecessary and sometimes invasive investigations, and also from a mechanistic point of view to understand the role of extracellular matrix proteins in neuronal homeostasis. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:962–975</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Sorbitol Is a Severity Biomarker for PMM2‐CDG with Therapeutic Implications</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor increases phosphomannomutase (PMM) enzyme activity in a PMM2-congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) worm model. Epalrestat also decreases sorbitol level in diabetic neuropathy. We evaluated the genetic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics, including the Nijmegen Progression CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), urine polyol levels and fibroblast glycoproteomics in patients with PMM2-CDG.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed PMM enzyme measurements, multiplexed proteomics, and glycoproteomics in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts before and after epalrestat treatment. Safety and efficacy of 0.8 mg/kg/day oral epalrestat were studied in a child with PMM2-CDG for 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PMM enzyme activity increased post-epalrestat treatment. Compared with controls, 24% of glycopeptides had reduced abundance in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts, 46% of which improved upon treatment. Total protein N-glycosylation improved upon epalrestat treatment bringing overall glycosylation toward the control fibroblasts’ glycosylation profile. Sorbitol levels were increased in the urine of 74% of patients with PMM2-CDG and correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy, and CDG severity rating scale. In the child with PMM2-CDG on epalrestat treatment, ataxia scores improved together with significant growth improvement. Urinary sorbitol levels nearly normalized in 3 months and blood transferrin glycosylation normalized in 6 months.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Epalrestat improved PMM enzyme activity, N-glycosylation, and glycosylation biomarkers in vitro. Leveraging cellular glycoproteome assessment, we provided a systems-level view of treatment efficacy and discovered potential novel biosignatures of therapy response. Epalrestat was well-tolerated and led to significant clinical improvements in the first pediatric patient with PMM2-CDG treated with epalrestat. We also propose urinary sorbitol as a novel biomarker for disease severity and treatment response in future clinical trials in PMM2-CDG. ANN NEUROL 20219999:n/a–n/a</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Results from a Longitudinal, Prospective, Multisite Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of subthreshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments.

                PCAD possesses a public health challenge resulting in years of productive life lost and an escalating burden on health systems. Objective of this review is to compare modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for PCAD compared to those without PCAD. This review will include all comparative observational studies conducted in adults aged >18 years with confirmed diagnosis of PCAD (on angiography) compared to those without PCAD. Databases to be searched include; PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and grey literature (Google Scholar). All identified studies will be screened for title and abstract and full-text against the inclusion criteria on Covidence software. Data relevant to exposures and outcomes will be extracted from all included studies. All studies selected for data extraction will be critically appraised for methodological quality. Meta-analysis using random-effects model will be performed using Review Manager 5.3. Effect sizes for categorical risk factors will be expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. For risk factors measured in continuous form, mean difference (if units are consistent) otherwise standardized mean difference (if units are different across studies) will be reported. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed using I2 test statistics. GRADE will be used to assess the certainty of the findings. Systematic review registration number: PROSPERO Registration # CRD42020173216

                Background: In this work, a COVID19 Application Programming Interface (API) was built using the Representational State Transfer (REST) API architecture and it is designed to fetch data daily from the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) website. Methods: The API is developed using ASP.NET Core Web API framework using C# programming language and Visual Studio 2019 as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The application has been deployed to Microsoft Azure as the cloud hosting platform and to successfully get new data from the NCDC website using Hangfire where a job has been scheduled to run every 12:30 pm (GMT + 1) and load the fetched data into our database. Various API Endpoints are defined to interact with the system and get data as needed, data can be fetched from a single state by name, all states on a particular day or over a range of days, etc. Results: The results from the data showed that Lagos and Abuja FCT in Nigeria were the hardest-hit states in terms of Total Confirmed cases while Lagos and Edo states had the highest death causalities with 465 and 186 as of August 2020. This analysis and many more can be easily made as a result of this API we have created that warehouses all COVID19 Data as presented by the NCDC since the first contracted case on February 29, 2020. This system was tested on the BlazeMeter platform, and it had an average of 11Hits/s with a response time of 2905milliseconds. Conclusions: The extension of NaijaCovidAPI over existing COVID19 APIs for Nigeria is the access and retrieval of previous data. Our contribution to the body of knowledge is the creation of a data hub for Nigeria's COVID-19 incidence from February 29, 2020, to date

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge creation in IT projects to accelerate digital innovation: two decade systematic literature review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A Case of Encephalopathy Presenting the Lentiform Fork Sign on MRI in a Diabetic Dialysis Patient [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia lesions showing an expansile high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI are termed the lentiform fork sign. This specific finding is mainly observed in diabetic patients with uremic encephalopathy with metabolic acidosis, although there are also reports in patients with ketoacidosis, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, intoxication, and following drug treatment (e.g., metformin). A 57-year-old Japanese man on chronic hemodialysis for 4 years because of diabetic nephropathy was admitted to our hospital for relatively rapid-onset gait disturbance, severe dysarthria, and consciousness disturbance. Brain T2-weighted MRI showed the lentiform fork sign. Hemodialysis was performed the day before admission, and laboratory tests showed mild metabolic (lactic) acidosis, but no uremia. Surprisingly, metformin, which is contraindicated for patients with end-stage kidney disease, had been prescribed for 6 months in his medication record, and his sluggish speaking and dysarthria appeared gradually after metformin treatment was started. Thus, the encephalopathy was considered to be related to metformin treatment. He received hemodialysis treatment for 6 consecutive days, and his consciousness disturbance and dysarthria improved in 1 week. At the 8-month follow-up, the size of the hyperintensity area on MRI had decreased, while the mild gait disturbance remained. Considering the rapid onset of gait and consciousness disturbance immediately before admission, diabetic uremic syndrome may also have occurred with metformin-related encephalopathy, and resulted in the lentiform fork sign, despite the patient showing no evidence of severe uremia on laboratory data.

                Fernandez-Abascal et al. report that a ClC Cl− channel expressed in glia associated with mechanosensory neurons mediates touch responses. The glial Cl− channel mediates efflux of Cl− from glia, which consequently permeates through GABA receptors expressed on mechanosensory neurons, resulting in regulation of neuronal Ca2+ and cAMP levels, enabling touch responses.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Meta-learning synaptic plasticity and memory addressing for continual familiarity detection</a></h4>

              
                Tyulmankov et al. use meta-learning to build neural network models for continual familiarity detection. They show that anti-Hebbian plasticity is the preferred mechanism for optimizing memory capacity and propose strong feedforward weights as an explicit addressing mechanism for selecting memory locations during storage and retrieval.

We discuss several such examples in relation to single-cell data and cellular growth. In particular, we show instances where what appears to be ordinary use of these statistical methods leads to incorrect conclusions such as growth being non-exponential as opposed to exponential and vice versa. We propose that the data analysis and its interpretation should be done in the context of a generative model, if possible. In this way, the statistical methods can be validated either analytically or against synthetic data generated via the use of the model, leading to a consistent method for inferring biological mechanisms from data. On applying the validated methods of data analysis to infer cellular growth on our experimental data, we find the growth of length in E. coli to be non-exponential. Our analysis shows that in the later stages of the cell cycle the growth rate is faster than exponential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gated recurrence enables simple and accurate sequence prediction in stochastic, changing, and structured environments</a></h4>

              
                From decision making to perception to language, predicting what is coming next is crucial. It is also challenging in stochastic, changing, and structured environments; yet the brain makes accurate predictions in many situations. What computational architecture could enable this feat? Bayesian inference makes optimal predictions but is prohibitively difficult to compute. Here, we show that a specific recurrent neural network architecture enables simple and accurate solutions in several environments. This architecture relies on three mechanisms: gating, lateral connections, and recurrent weight training. Like the optimal solution and the human brain, such networks develop internal representations of their changing environment (including estimates of the environment's latent variables and the precision of these estimates), leverage multiple levels of latent structure, and adapt their effective learning rate to changes without changing their connection weights. Being ubiquitous in the brain, gated recurrence could therefore serve as a generic building block to predict in real-life environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Histone deacetylase 3 represses cholesterol efflux during CD4+ T-cell activation</a></h4>

              
                After antigenic activation, quiescent naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alter their metabolism to proliferate. This metabolic shift increases production of nucleotides, amino acids, fatty acids, and sterols. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is critical for activation of murine peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to proliferate and blast after in vitro TCR/CD28 stimulation. Upon T-cell activation, genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis are upregulated while genes that promote cholesterol efflux are repressed. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had reduced levels of cellular cholesterol both before and after activation. HDAC3-deficient cells upregulate cholesterol synthesis appropriately after activation, but fail to repress cholesterol efflux; notably, they overexpress cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Repression of these genes is the primary function for HDAC3 in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as addition of exogenous cholesterol restored proliferative capacity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate HDAC3 is essential during CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation to repress cholesterol efflux.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">REST/NRSF drives homeostatic plasticity of inhibitory synapses in a target-dependent fashion</a></h4>

              
                The repressor-element 1-silencing transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) controls hundreds of neuron-specific genes. We showed that REST/NRSF downregulates glutamatergic transmission in response to hyperactivity, thus contributing to neuronal homeostasis. However, whether GABAergic transmission is also implicated in the homeostatic action of REST/NRSF is unknown. Here, we show that hyperactivity-induced REST/NRSF activation, triggers a homeostatic rearrangement of GABAergic inhibition, with increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and amplitude of evoked IPSCs in mouse cultured hippocampal neurons. Notably, this effect is limited to inhibitory-onto-excitatory neuron synapses, whose density increases at somatic level and decreases in dendritic regions, demonstrating a complex target- and area-selectivity. The upscaling of perisomatic inhibition was occluded by TrkB receptor inhibition and resulted from a coordinated and sequential activation of the <i>Npas4</i> and <i>Bdnf</i> gene programs. On the opposite, the downscaling of dendritic inhibition was REST-dependent, but BDNF-independent. The findings highlight the central role of REST/NRSF in the complex transcriptional responses aimed at rescuing physiological levels of network activity in front of the ever-changing environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell-level protein analysis revealing the roles of autoantigen-reactive B lymphocytes in autoimmune disease and the murine model</a></h4>

              
                Despite antigen affinity of B cells varying from cell to cell, functional analyses of antigen-reactive B cells on individual B cells are missing due to technical difficulties. Especially in the field of autoimmune diseases, promising pathogenic B cells have not been adequately studied to date because of its rarity. In this study, functions of autoantigen-reactive B cells in autoimmune disease were analyzed at the single-cell level. Since topoisomerase I is a distinct autoantigen, we targeted systemic sclerosis as autoimmune disease. Decreased and increased affinities for topoisomerase I of topoisomerase I-reactive B cells led to anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine production associated with the inhibition and development of fibrosis, which is the major symptom of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased affinity of topoisomerase I-reactive B cells suppressed fibrosis. These results indicate that autoantigen-reactive B cells contribute to the disease manifestations in autoimmune disease through their antigen affinity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular architecture of the human tRNA ligase complex</a></h4>

              
                RtcB enzymes are RNA ligases that play essential roles in tRNA splicing, unfolded protein response, and RNA repair. In metazoa, RtcB functions as part of a five-subunit tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) along with Ddx1, Cgi-99, Fam98B and Ashwin. The human tRNA-LC or its individual subunits have been implicated in additional cellular processes including microRNA maturation, viral replication, DNA double-strand break repair and mRNA transport. Here we present a biochemical analysis of the inter-subunit interactions within the human tRNA-LC along with crystal structures of the catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal domain of CGI-99. We show that the core of the human tRNA-LC is assembled from RTCB and the C-terminal alpha-helical regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B, all of which are required for complex integrity. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 displays structural homology to calponin-homology domains, and CGI-99 and FAM98B associate via their N-terminal domains to form a stable subcomplex. The crystal structure of GMP-bound RTCB reveals divalent metal coordination geometry in the active site, providing insights into its catalytic mechanism. Collectively, these findings shed light on the molecular architecture and mechanism of the human tRNA ligase complex, and provide a structural framework for understanding its functions in cellular RNA metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Low affinity integrin states have faster ligand binding kinetics than the high affinity state</a></h4>

              
                Integrin conformational ensembles contain two low-affinity states, bent-closed and extended-closed, and an active, high-affinity, extended-open state. It is widely thought that integrins must be activated before they bind ligand; however, one model holds that activation follows ligand binding. As ligand-binding kinetics are not only rate limiting for cell adhesion but also have important implications for the mechanism of activation, we measure them here for integrins α4β1 and α5β1 and show that the low-affinity states bind substantially faster than the high-affinity state. On and off-rates are similar for integrins on cell surfaces and as ectodomain fragments. Although the extended-open conformation's on-rate is ~20-fold slower, its off-rate is ~25,000-fold slower, resulting in a large affinity increase. The tighter ligand-binding pocket in the open state may slow its on-rate. Low affinity integrin states not only bind ligand more rapidly, but are also more populous on the cell surface than high affinity states. Thus, our results suggest that integrin binding to ligand may precede, rather than follow, activation by 'inside-out signaling'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A distributed residue network permits conformational binding specificity in a conserved family of actin remodelers</a></h4>

              
                Metazoan proteomes contain many paralogous proteins that have evolved distinct functions. The Ena/VASP family of actin regulators consists of three members that share an EVH1 interaction domain with a 100 % conserved binding site. A proteome-wide screen revealed photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE) as a high-affinity ligand for ENAH EVH1. Here, we report the surprising observation that PCARE is ~100-fold specific for ENAH over paralogs VASP and EVL and can selectively bind ENAH and inhibit ENAH-dependent adhesion in cells. Specificity arises from a mechanism whereby PCARE stabilizes a conformation of the ENAH EVH1 domain that is inaccessible to family members VASP and EVL. Structure-based modeling rapidly identified seven residues distributed throughout EVL that are sufficient to differentiate binding by ENAH vs. EVL. By exploiting the ENAH-specific conformation, we rationally designed the tightest and most selective ENAH binder to date. Our work uncovers a conformational mechanism of interaction specificity that distinguishes highly similar paralogs and establishes tools for dissecting specific Ena/VASP functions in processes including cancer cell invasion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Silencing long ascending propriospinal neurons after spinal cord injury improves hindlimb stepping in the adult rat</a></h4>

              
                Long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) are a subpopulation of spinal cord interneurons that directly connect the lumbar and cervical enlargements. Previously we showed, in uninjured animals, that conditionally silencing LAPNs disrupted left-right coordination of the hindlimbs and forelimbs in a context-dependent manner, demonstrating that LAPNs secure alternation of the fore- and hindlimb pairs during overground stepping. Given the ventrolateral location of LAPN axons in the spinal cord white matter, many likely remain intact following incomplete, contusive, thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), suggesting a potential role in the recovery of stepping. Thus, we hypothesized that silencing LAPNs after SCI would disrupt recovered locomotion. Instead, we found that silencing spared LAPNs post-SCI improved locomotor function, including paw placement order and timing, and a decrease in the number of dorsal steps. Silencing also restored left-right hindlimb coordination and normalized spatiotemporal features of gait such as stance and swing time. However, hindlimb-forelimb coordination was not restored. These data indicate that the temporal information carried between the spinal enlargements by the spared LAPNs post-SCI is detrimental to recovered hindlimb locomotor function. These findings are an illustration of a post-SCI neuroanatomical-functional paradox and have implications for the development of neuronal- and axonal-protective therapeutic strategies and the clinical study/implementation of neuromodulation strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">cacna2d3, a voltage-gated calcium channel subunit, functions in vertebrate habituation learning and the startle sensitivity threshold</a></h4>

              
                The ability to filter sensory information into relevant versus irrelevant stimuli is a fundamental, conserved property of the central nervous system and is accomplished in part through habituation learning. Synaptic plasticity that underlies habituation learning has been described at the cellular level, yet the genetic regulators of this plasticity remain poorly understood, as do circuits that mediate sensory filtering. A forward genetic screen for zebrafish genes that control habituation learning identified a mutant allele doryp177 that caused reduced habituation of the acoustic startle response. Whole-genome sequencing identified the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha-2/delta-3 (cacna2d3) as a candidate gene affected in doryp177 mutants. Behavioral characterization of larvae homozygous for two additional, independently derived mutant alleles of cacna2d3, together with failure of these alleles to complement doryp177, confirmed a critical role for cacna2d3 in habituation learning. Notably, detailed analyses of the acoustic response in mutant larvae also revealed increased startle sensitivity to acoustic stimuli, suggesting a broader role for cacna2d3 in controlling innate response thresholds to acoustic stimuli. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role for cacna2d3 in sensory filtering, a process that is disrupted in human CNS disorders, e.g. ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of subjective peripheral sensation, F-waves, and somatosensory evoked potentials in response to a unilateral pinch task measured on the contractile and non-contractile sides</a></h4>

              
                Depression of sensory input during voluntary muscle contractions has been demonstrated using electrophysiological methods in both animals and humans. However, the association between electrophysiological responses of the sensory system and subjective peripheral sensation (SPS) during a voluntary muscle contraction remains unclear. Our aim in this study was to describe the changes in SPS, spinal -motoneuron excitability (F-wave to M-wave amplitude), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) during a unilateral pinch-grip task. Outcome variables were measured on the side ipsilateral and contralateral to the muscle contraction, and at rest (control). Participants were 8 healthy men, 20.9{+/-}0.8 years of age. The isometric pinch-grip task was performed at 30% of the maximum voluntary isometric force measured for the right and left hand separately. The appearance rate of the F-wave during the task was significantly higher for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and control condition. Although there was no difference in F-wave latency between hands and the control condition, the amplitude of the F-wave was significantly higher for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and the control condition. There was no difference in the amplitude of the SEP at N20. However, the amplitude at P25 was significantly lower for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and the control condition. The accuracy rate of detecting tactile stimulation, evaluated for 20 repetitions using a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at the sensory threshold for each participant, was significantly lower during the pinch-grip task for both the ipsilateral (right) and contralateral (left) hand compared to the control condition. Overall, our findings show that SPS and neurophysiological parameters were not modulated in parallel during the task, with changes in subjective sensation preceding changes in electrophysiological indices during the motor task. Our findings provide basic information on sensory-motor coordination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crowding changes appearance systematically in peripheral, amblyopic, and developing vision</a></h4>

              
                Visual crowding is the disruptive effect of clutter on object recognition. Although most prominent in adult peripheral vision, crowding also disrupts foveal vision in typically-developing children and those with strabismic amblyopia. Do these crowding effects share the same mechanism? Here we exploit observations that crowded errors in peripheral vision are not random: target objects appear either averaged with the flankers (assimilation), or replaced by them (substitution). If amblyopic and developmental crowding share the same mechanism then their errors should be similarly systematic. We tested foveal vision in children aged 3-9 years with typical vision or strabismic amblyopia, and peripheral vision in adults. The perceptual effects of crowding were measured by requiring observers to adjust a reference stimulus to match the perceived orientation of a target "Vac-Man" element. When the target was surrounded by flankers that differed by 30deg., adults and children reported orientations between the target and flankers (assimilation). Errors were reduced with 90deg. differences, but primarily matched the flanker orientation (substitution) when they did occur. A population pooling model of crowding successfully simulated this pattern of errors in all three groups. We conclude that the perceptual effects of amblyopic and developing crowding are systematic and resemble the near periphery in adults, suggesting a common underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking Geometric Deep Learning for Cortical Segmentation and Neurodevelopmental Phenotype Prediction</a></h4>

              
                The emerging field of geometric deep learning extends the application of convolutional neural networks to irregular domains such as graphs, meshes and surfaces. Several recent studies have explored the potential for using these techniques to analyse and segment the cortical surface. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of these approaches to one another, nor to existing Euclidean methods, to date. This paper benchmarks a collection of geometric and traditional deep learning models on phenotype prediction and segmentation of sphericalised neonatal cortical surface data, from the publicly available Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Tasks include prediction of postmenstrual age at scan, gestational age at birth and segmentation of the cortical surface into anatomical regions defined by the M-CRIB-S atlas. Performance was assessed not only in terms of model precision, but also in terms of network dependence on image registration, and model interpretation via occlusion. Networks were trained both on sphericalised and anatomical cortical meshes. Findings suggest that the utility of geometric deep learning over traditional deep learning is highly task-specific, which has implications for the design of future deep learning models on the cortical surface. The code, and instructions for data access, are available from https://github.com/Abdulah-Fawaz/Benchmarking-Surface-DL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeted memory reactivation in human REM sleep elicits recurrent, temporally compressed reactivation</a></h4>

              
                Memories are reactivated during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but the question of whether equivalent reactivation also occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is hotly debated. To examine this, we used a technique called targeted memory reactivation (TMR) in which sounds are paired with learned material in wake, and then re-presented in subsequent sleep to trigger reactivation. We then used machine learning classifiers to identify TMR-induced reactivation in REM. The reactivation we measured was temporally compressed by approximately five times during REM compared to wakeful performance of the task, and often occurred twice after a single TMR cue. Reactivation strength positively predicted overnight performance improvement and was only apparent in trials with high theta activity. These findings provide strong evidence for memory reactivation in human REM sleep after TMR as well as an initial characterisation of this reactivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping lesion, structural disconnection, and functional disconnection to symptoms in semantic aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Patients with semantic aphasia have impaired control of semantic retrieval, often accompanied by executive dysfunction following left hemisphere stroke. Many but not all of these patients have damage to the left inferior frontal gyrus, important for semantic and cognitive control. Yet semantic and cognitive control networks are highly distributed, including posterior as well as anterior components. Accordingly, semantic aphasia might not only reflect local damage but also white matter structural and functional disconnection. Here we characterise the lesions and predicted patterns of structural and functional disconnection in individuals with semantic aphasia and relate these effects to semantic and executive impairment. Impaired semantic cognition was associated with infarction in distributed left-hemisphere regions, including in the left anterior inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortex. Lesions were associated with executive dysfunction within a set of adjacent but distinct left frontoparietal clusters. Performance on executive tasks was also associated with interhemispheric structural disconnection across the corpus callosum. Poor semantic cognition was associated with small left-lateralized structurally disconnected clusters, including in the left posterior temporal cortex. These results demonstrate that while left-lateralized semantic and executive control regions are often damaged together in stroke aphasia, these deficits are associated with distinct patterns of structural disconnection, consistent with the bilateral nature of executive control and the left-lateralized yet distributed semantic control network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupillometry and the vigilance decrement: Task-evoked but not baseline pupil measures reflect declining performance in visual vigilance tasks</a></h4>

              
                Baseline and task-evoked pupil measures are known to reflect the activity of the nervous system's central arousal mechanisms. With the increasing availability, affordability and flexibility of video-based eye tracking hardware, these measures may one day find practical application in real-time biobehavioral monitoring systems to assess performance or fitness for duty in tasks requiring vigilant attention. But real-world vigilance tasks are predominantly visual in their nature and most research in this area has taken place in the auditory domain. Here we explore the relationship between pupil size--both baseline and task-evoked--and behavioral performance measures in two novel vigilance tasks requiring visual target detection: 1) a traditional vigilance task involving prolonged, continuous, and uninterrupted performance (n = 28), and 2) a psychomotor vigilance task (n = 25). In both tasks, behavioral performance and task-evoked pupil responses declined as time spent on task increased, corroborating previous reports in the literature of a vigilance decrement with a corresponding reduction in task-evoked pupil measures. Also in line with previous findings, baseline pupil size did not show a consistent relationship with performance measures. We discuss our findings considering the adaptive gain theory of locus coeruleus function and question the validity of the assumption that baseline (prestimulus) pupil size and task-evoked (poststimulus) pupil measures correspond to the tonic and phasic firing modes of the LC.

                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include loss of motivation and anhedonia. If multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy fail in some patients with MDD, their condition is then termed treatment - resistant depression (TRD). MDD can be associated with abnormalities in the reward - system - dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, in which the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) play major roles. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the NAc alleviates the depressive symptoms of MDD. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of this DBS has remained elusive. In this study, using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we investigated the behavioral and neurobiological effects of NAc - DBS on the multidimensional depression - like phenotypes induced by CUMS by integrating behavioral, in vivo microdialysis coupled with high - performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detector (HPLC - ECD), calcium imaging, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation methods in freely moving mice. We found that long - term and repeated, but not single, NAc - DBS induced robust antidepressant responses in CUMS mice. Moreover, even a single trial NAc - DBS led to the elevation of the {gamma} - aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, accompanied by the increase in dopamine (DA) neuron activity in the VTA. Both the inhibition of the GABAA receptor activity and knockdown of the GABAA - 1 gene in VTA - GABA neurons blocked the antidepressant effect of NAc - DBS in CUMS mice. Our results showed that NAc - DBS could disinhibit VTA - DA neurons by regulating the level of GABA and the activity of VTA - GABA in the VTA and could finally correct the depression - like behaviors in the CUMS mouse model.

                What fundamental property of our environment would be most valuable and optimal in characterizing the emotional dynamics we experience in our daily life? Empirical work has shown that an accurate estimation of uncertainty is necessary for our optimal perception, learning, and decision-making. However, the role of this uncertainty in governing our affective dynamics remains unexplored. Using Bayesian encoding, decoding and computational modelling, we show that emotional experiences naturally arise due to ongoing uncertainty estimations in a hierarchical neural architecture. This hierarchical organization involves a number of prefrontal sub-regions, with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex having the highest representational complexity of uncertainty. Crucially, this representational complexity, was sensitive to temporal fluctuations in uncertainty and was predictive of participants predisposition to anxiety. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of uncertainty revealed a distinct functional double dissociation within the OFC. Specifically, the medial OFC showed higher connectivity with the DMN, while the lateral OFC with that of the FPN in response to the evolving affect. Finally, we uncovered a temporally predictive code updating individual beliefs swiftly in the face of fluctuating uncertainty in the lateral OFC. A biologically relevant and computationally crucial parameter in theories of brain function, we extend uncertainty to be a defining component of complex emotions.

                Neurotransmitter receptors modulate the signaling between neurons. Thus, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters play a key role in shaping brain function. Due to the lack of comprehensive neurotransmitter receptor/transporter density datasets, microarray gene expression is often used as a proxy for receptor densities. In the present report, we comprehensively test the expression-density association for a total of 27 neurotransmitter receptors, receptor binding-sites, and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems, using both PET and autoradiography imaging modalities. We find poor spatial correspondences between gene expression and density for all neurotransmitter receptors and transporters except four single-protein metabotropic receptors (5-HT1A, D2, CB1, and MOR). These expression-density associations are related to population variance and change across different classes of laminar differentiation. Altogether, we recommend using direct measures of receptor and transporter density when relating neurotransmitter systems to brain structure and function.

                Rapid structural brain plasticity after acute stress has been shown in animals. It is unknown whether such stress-related brain changes also occur in humans, in which they have been found, using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after motor learning and visual stimulation. We here investigated grey matter volume (GMV) changes after acute stress in humans and tested their relation to psychophysiological stress measures. Sixty-seven healthy men (25.8 +/- 2.7 years) completed a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control version while blood, saliva, heart rate, and psychometrics were sampled. T1-weighted MP2RAGE images at 3T MRI were acquired 45 min before and 90 min after intervention onset. GMV changes were analysed using voxel-based morphometry. Associations with endocrine, autonomic, and subjective stress measures were tested with linear models. We found significant group-by-time interactions in several brain clusters including anterior/mid-cingulate cortices and bilateral insula: GMV was increased in the stress group relative to the control group, in which several clusters showed a GMV decrease. We found no significant group-by-time interaction for other MRI parameters, including cerebral blood flow, but a significant association of GMV changes with state anxiety and heart rate variability changes. In summary, we show rapid GMV changes following acute psychosocial stress in humans. The results suggest that endogenous circadian brain changes are counteracted by acute stress and generally emphasize the influence of stress on the brain.

                Patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) may have a disproportionally severe outcome after head trauma, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we subjected knock-in mice carrying the severer S218L or milder R192Q FHM1 gain-of-function missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene that encodes the 1A subunit of neuronal voltage-gated CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channels and their wild-type (WT) littermates to experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and investigated cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), lesion volume, brain edema formation, and functional outcome. After TBI, all mutant mice displayed considerably more CSDs and seizures than WT mice, while S218L mutant mice had a substantially higher mortality. Brain edema formation and the resulting increase in intracranial pressure was more pronounced in mutant mice, while only S218L mutant mice had larger lesion volumes and worse functional outcome. Here we show that gain of CaV2.1 channel function worsens histopathological and functional outcome after TBI in mice. This phenotype was associated with a higher number of CSDs, increased seizure activity, and more pronounced brain edema formation. Hence, our results suggest increased susceptibility for CSDs and seizures as potential mechanisms for bad outcome after TBI in FHM1 mutation carriers.

                Metacognition refers to the ability to be aware of one's own cognition. Ample evidence indicate that metacognition in the human primate is highly dissociable from cognition, specialized across domains, and subserved by distinct neural substrates. However, these aspects remain relatively understudied in the macaque monkeys. Here we investigated the functionality of macaques' metacognition by combining a confidence proxy, hierarchical Bayesian meta-d' computational modelling, and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation technique. We found a critical role of Brodmann Area 46d (BA 46d) in supporting metacognition without implicating task performance and its critical time-sensitive role in meta-calculation. We additionally revealed that macaque metacognition is highly domain-specific with respect to memory and perception decisions. These findings carry implications for our understanding of metacognitive introspection within the primate lineage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying potential key genes and existing drugs for Multiple sclerosis, Schizophrenia, and Autism- an in silico approach</a></h4>

              
                Nowadays, neurological conditions are a major concern as it not only preys on a patients health but also is a huge economic burden that is placed on the patients family. The diagnosis and treatment of disease sometimes cause methodological limitations. This is mainly common for individuals who have the signs of MS and schizophrenia (SZ). Patients suffering from multiple sclerosis are more likely to develop schizophrenia. Besides, a significant portion of patients who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) later acquire the symptoms of Schizophrenia. In this study, we used bioinformatics tools to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all these diseases, and then we created a protein-protein interaction network using the online software STRING and identified 15 significant genes with the help of Cytohubba a plug-in tool in Cytoscape, the offline software (version3.8.2). We then used a drug-gene interaction database to conduct a drug-gene interaction study of the 15 hub genes and from there we showed that there are 37 existing FDA-approved drugs were obtained. These findings may provide a new and common therapeutic approach for MS, SZ, and ASD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of spatiotemporally changing environment on serial dependence in ensemble representations</a></h4>

              
                The recent visual past has a strong impact on our current perception. Recent studies of serial dependence in perception show that low-level adaptation repels our current perception away from previous stimuli whereas post-perceptual decision attracts perceptual report toward the immediate past. In their studies, these repulsive and attractive biases were observed with different task demands perturbing ongoing sequential process. Therefore, it is unclear whether the opposite biases arise naturally in navigating complex real-life environments. Here we only manipulated the environmental statistics to characterize how serially dependent perceptual decisions unfold in spatiotemporally changing visual environments. During sequential mean orientation adjustment task on the array of Gabor patches, we found that the repulsion effect dominated only when ensemble variance increased across consecutive trials whereas the attraction effect prevailed when ensemble variance decreased or remained the same. The observed attractive bias by high-to-low-variance stimuli and repulsive bias by low-to-high-variance stimuli were reinforced by the repeated exposure to the low and the high ensemble variance, respectively. Further, this variance-dependent differential pattern of serial dependence in ensemble representation remained the same regardless of whether observers had a prior knowledge of environmental statistics or not. We used a Bayesian observer model constrained by visual adaptation to provide a unifying account of both attractive and repulsive bias in perception. Our results establish that the temporal integration and segregation of visual information is flexibly adjusted through variance adaptation.

                Background: Normative childhood motor network resting-state fMRI effective connectivity is undefined, yet necessary for translatable dynamic resting-state network informed treatments in pediatric movement disorders. Method: Cross-spectral dynamic causal modelling of resting-state fMRI was investigated in 19 neurotypically developing 5-7-year-old children. Fully connected six-node motor network models were created for each hemisphere including primary motor cortex, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus internus, thalamus, and contralateral cerebellum. Parametric Empirical Bayes with exhaustive Bayesian model reduction and Bayesian modeling averaging were used to create a group model for each hemisphere; Purdue Pegboard Test (PPBT) scores for relevant hand motor behavior were also entered as a covariate at the group level to determine the brain-behavior relationship. Results: Overall, the resting-state functional MRI effective connectivity of motor cortico-basal ganglia-cerebellar networks was similar across hemispheres, with greater connectivity in the left hemisphere. The motor network effective connectivity relationships between the nodes were consistent and robust across subjects. Additionally, the PPBT score for each hand was positively correlated with the thalamus to contralateral cerebellum connection. Discussion: The normative effective connectivity from resting-state functional MRI in children largely reflect the direction of inter-nodal signal predicted by other prior modalities and was consistent and robust across subjects, with differences from these prior task-dependent modalities that likely reflect the motor rest-action state during acquisition. Effective connectivity of the motor network was correlated with motor behavior, indicating effective connectivity brain-behavior relationship has physiological meaning in the normally developing. Thus, it may be helpful for future studies in children with movement disorders, wherein comparison to normative effective connectivity will be critical for network-targeted intervention.

                The assembly of functional neuronal circuits requires appropriate numbers of distinct classes of neurons, but the mechanisms through which their relative proportions are established remain poorly defined. Investigating the mouse striatum, here we found that the two most prominent subtypes of striatal interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic and cholinergic (ChAT+) interneurons, undergo extensive programmed cell death between the first and second postnatal weeks. Remarkably, the survival of PV+ and ChAT+ interneurons is regulated by distinct mechanisms mediated by their specific afferent connectivity. While long-range cortical inputs control PV+ interneuron survival, ChAT+ interneuron survival is regulated by local input from the medium spiny neurons. Our results identify input-specific circuit mechanisms that operate during the period of programmed cell death to establish the final number of interneurons in nascent striatal networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed processing for action control by prelimbic circuits targeting anterior-posterior dorsal striatal subregions.</a></h4>

              
                Fronto-striatal circuits have been extensively implicated in the cognitive control of behavioral output for both social and appetitive rewards. The functional diversity of prefrontal cortical populations is strongly dependent on their synaptic targets, with control of motor output strongly mediated by connectivity to the dorsal striatum. Despite evidence for functional diversity along the anterior-posterior axis of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), it is unclear how distinct fronto-striatal sub-circuits support neural computations essential for action selection. Here we identify prefrontal populations targeting distinct DMS subregions and characterize their functional roles. We first performed neural circuit tracing to reveal segregated prefrontal populations defined by anterior/posterior dorsomedial striatal target. We then probed the functional relevance of these parallel circuits via in vivo calcium imaging and temporally precise causal manipulations during a feedback-based 2-alternative choice task. Single-photon imaging revealed circuit-specific representations of task-relevant information with prelimbic neurons targeting anterior DMS (PL::A-DMS) uniquely encoded choices and responses to negative outcomes, while prelimbic neurons targeting posterior DMS (PL::P-DMS) encoded internal representations of value and positive outcomes contingent on prior choice. Consistent with this distributed coding, optogenetic inhibition of PL::A-DMS circuits strongly impacted choice monitoring and behavioral control in response to negative outcomes while perturbation of PL::P-DMS signals impaired task engagement and strategies following positive outcomes. Di-synaptic retrograde tracing uncovered differences in afferent connectivity that may underlie these pathways functional divergence. Together our data uncover novel PL populations engaged in distributed processing for action control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A temporal sequence of thalamic activity unfolds at transitions in behavioral arousal state</a></h4>

              
                The moment of awakening from sleep reflects a profound transformation in neural activity and behavior. The thalamus is a key controller of arousal state, but whether its diverse nuclei exhibit coordinated or distinct activity at transitions in behavioral arousal state is not known. Using fast fMRI at ultra-high field (7 Tesla), we measured sub-second activity across thalamocortical networks and within nine thalamic nuclei to delineate these dynamics during spontaneous transitions in behavioral arousal state. We discovered a stereotyped sequence of activity across thalamic nuclei that preceded behavioral arousal after a period of inactivity, followed by widespread cortical deactivation. These thalamic dynamics were linked to whether participants remained awake or fell back asleep, with unified thalamic activation reflecting subsequent maintenance of awake behavior. These results provide an outline of the complex interactions across thalamocortical circuits that orchestrate arousal state transitions, and additionally, demonstrate that fast fMRI can resolve sub-second subcortical dynamics in the human brain.

	<p>Previous studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) reduces food intake and body mass gain and regulates proteins related to lipid metabolism in obese rats. In ovariectomized rats, GbE restored the hippocampal and hypothalamic serotonergic system activity, favoring the spontaneous feeding decrement. Considering the promising hypophagic effect of GbE, this study aimed to investigate the effect of a single acute dose on hypothalamic pathways that regulate feeding behavior in male rats. Four-month-old Wistar male rats received either a single acute oral GbE dose (500 mg/kg) or vehicle. Food intake and body mass were measured after 1, 4, 12, and 24 h. Rats were euthanized, and hypothalami were removed for mRNA quantification of anorexigenic (POMC/CART) and orexigenic (AgRP/NPY) neuropeptides, leptin/serotonin receptors (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2C), and serotonin transporters. We also investigated POMC, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2C protein levels. A single acute GbE dose induced the hypothalamic POMC, CART, and 5-HT2C gene expression but failed to modify orexigenic effectors. No alterations in food intake, body mass, and hypothalamic protein levels were observed. In summary, the present findings demonstrate the rapid stimulation of pivotal hypothalamic anorexigenic pathways in response to a single GbE administration, reinforcing the GbE hypophagic activity. However, more studies are necessary to evaluate its potential as an appetite modulator.</p>

	<p>A 23-year-old woman was presented to the Emergency Unit with intracranial hypertension syndrome and blindness in her left eye which had started recently. A cranial native computed tomography scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast examinations revealed a giant intracranial cystic lesion, extending into the left frontal lobe, which was compressing the optic chiasm and eroding the internal plate of the left frontal bone. Surgical craniotomy was performed for evacuation and decompression, but during the craniotomy the cyst ruptured. After assessing the degree of erosion of the internal bone plate, we concluded that the primary origin of the cyst was intraosseous. With the dura mater being intact, abundant lavage with H2O2 was applied and the bone flap was replaced after rigorous bone scraping. Imaging control at six and twelve months identified no recurrence of the cyst. In the literature, hydatid cysts located in the skull bone are very rare and most of them rupture intraoperatively. Given their extremely low incidence in developed countries, any neurosurgeons&amp;amp;rsquo; experience with such pathology is limited and in some cases surgery cannot be delayed. In the case of intracerebral hydatid cysts, a neurosurgeon usually has only one shot at surgery, so simple and quick-to-access therapeutic guidelines must be developed in order to inform the choice of surgical technique. We conclude that the most successful surgical approach could be double concentric craniotomy. This surgical technique is used in intracerebral tumors, which also have an important bone invasion.</p>

	<p>Plasmalogens are alkenyl-acyl glycerophospholipids and decreased in post-mortem Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) brains. The aim of this study is to investigate the time-dependent changes of plasmalogens in the hippocampus of an AD model mouse (J20). Plasmalogen levels at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months were analyzed by liquid-chromatography-targeted-multiplexed-selected-reaction-monitoring-tandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-SRM/MS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were evaluated using dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA). Plasmalogen synthesizing enzyme glycerone-phosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) and late endosome marker Rab7 levels were quantified by Western blotting. GNPAT localization, changes of neuronal and glial cell numbers were evaluated by immunostaining. Compared to wild-type mice (WT), total plasmalogen-ethanolamine, but not plasmalogen-choline levels, were increased at 9 months and subsequently decreased at 15 months in J20 mice. A principal component analysis of plasmalogen-ethanolamine species could separate WT and J20 mice both at 9 and 15 months. Both GNPAT and Rab7 protein were increased in J20 mice at 9 months, whereas GNPAT was decreased at 15 months. ROS levels were increased in J20 mice except for 9 months. Our results suggest that increased plasmalogen-ethanolamine could counteract ROS levels and contribute to the phagocytosis process in J20 mice at 9 months. Such results might indicate a transient protective response of plasmalogen-ethanolamine in AD conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Live Imaging of Primary Neurons in Long-Term Cryopreserved Human Nerve Tissue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Tissue cryopreservation provides a convenient solution for tackling one of the major problems in neuroscience research, namely, the scarce availability of human nerve tissues, especially if needed alive. While brain tissue can be used only postmortem, live nerve tissue can reasonably well be harvested from the periphery. A valuable source of primary neurons is the intestine, which compared with brain has the advantage to be safely accessible via endoscopy. The nerve tissue innervating the intestine (the enteric nervous system; ENS) can be sampled with regular endoscopic biopsy forceps and remains viable for multiple physiological and immunohistochemical tests, as previously demonstrated. Here, we present a method to preserve, over longer periods of time, human primary neurons contained in these biopsies. The use of a cryoprotective agent and the application of controlled cooling revealed to be crucial to properly store the nerve tissue and to enable functional measurements after thawing. These primary neurons were evaluated for functionality (live imaging) and morphology (histology) up to one year after cryopreservation. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging indicated that human primary neurons remained viable and responded to selective stimulations (serotonergic and nicotinic agonists) after cryopreservation. Additionally, immunohistochemistry performed with specific neuronal markers showed that nerve structure and neuronal morphology were retained, with no signs of cellular damage. In this study, we demonstrate that the human ENS is a realistic source of primary neurons, which can be successfully preserved over long times and as such can be exploited both for gastrointestinal-specific as well as for general neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">"Tripartite Synapses" in Taste Buds: A Role for Type I Glial-like Taste Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>In mammalian taste buds, Type I cells comprise half of all cells. These are termed "glial-like" based on morphologic and molecular features, but there are limited studies describing their function. We tested whether Type I cells sense chemosensory activation of adjacent chemosensory (i.e., Types II and III) taste bud cells, similar to synaptic glia. Using <I>Gad2</I>;;GCaMP3 mice of both sexes, we confirmed by immunostaining that, within taste buds, GCaMP expression is predominantly in Type I cells (with no Type II and 28% Type III cells expressing weakly). In dissociated taste buds, GCaMP+ Type I cells responded to bath-applied ATP (10-100 &mu;<scp>m</scp>) but not to 5-HT (transmitters released by Type II or III cells, respectively). Type I cells also did not respond to taste stimuli (5 &mu;<scp>m</scp> cycloheximide, 1 m<scp>m</scp> denatonium). In lingual slice preparations also, Type I cells responded to bath-applied ATP (10-100 &mu;<scp>m</scp>). However, when taste buds in the slice were stimulated with bitter tastants (cycloheximide, denatonium, quinine), Type I cells responded robustly. Taste-evoked responses of Type I cells in the slice preparation were significantly reduced by desensitizing purinoceptors or by purinoceptor antagonists (suramin, PPADS), and were essentially eliminated by blocking synaptic ATP release (carbenoxolone) or degrading extracellular ATP (apyrase). Thus, taste-evoked release of afferent ATP from type II chemosensory cells, in addition to exciting gustatory afferent fibers, also activates glial-like Type I taste cells. We speculate that Type I cells sense chemosensory activation and that they participate in synaptic signaling, similarly to glial cells at CNS tripartite synapses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most studies of taste buds view the chemosensitive excitable cells that express taste receptors as the sole mediators of taste detection and transmission to the CNS. Type I "glial-like" cells, with their ensheathing morphology, are mostly viewed as responsible for clearing neurotransmitters and as the "glue" holding the taste bud together. In the present study, we demonstrate that, when intact taste buds respond to their natural stimuli, Type I cells sense the activation of the chemosensory cells by detecting the afferent transmitter. Because Type I cells synthesize GABA, a known gliotransmitter, and cognate receptors are present on both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, Type I cells may participate in GABAergic synaptic transmission in the manner of astrocytes at tripartite synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sustained ErbB Activation Causes Demyelination and Hypomyelination by Driving Necroptosis of Mature Oligodendrocytes and Apoptosis of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to genetic and environmental insults and its injury leads to demyelinating diseases. The roles of ErbB receptors in maintaining the CNS myelin integrity are largely unknown. Here, we overactivate ErbB receptors that mediate signaling of either neuregulin (NRG) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) family growth factors and found their synergistic activation caused deleterious outcomes in white matter. Sustained ErbB activation induced by the tetracycline-dependent mouse tool <I>Plp</I>-tTA resulted in demyelination, axonal degeneration, oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in white matter. Moreover, there was hypermyelination before these inflammatory pathologic events. In contrast, sustained ErbB activation induced by another tetracycline-dependent mouse tool <I>Sox10</I><sup>+/rtTA</sup> caused hypomyelination in the corpus callosum and optic nerve, which appeared to be a developmental deficit and did not associate with OPC regeneration, astrogliosis, or microgliosis. By tracing the differentiation states of cells expressing tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA)/reverse tTA (rtTA)-dependent transgene or pulse-labeled reporter proteins <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>, we found that <I>Plp</I>-tTA targeted mainly mature oligodendrocytes (MOs), whereas <I>Sox10</I><sup>+/rtTA</sup> targeted OPCs and newly-formed oligodendrocytes (NFOs). The distinct phenotypes of mice with ErbB overactivation induced by <I>Plp</I>-tTA and <I>Sox10</I><sup>+/rtTA</sup> consolidated their nonoverlapping targeting preferences in the oligodendrocyte lineage, and enabled us to demonstrate that ErbB overactivation in MOs induced necroptosis that caused inflammatory demyelination, whereas in OPCs induced apoptosis that caused noninflammatory hypomyelination. Early interference with aberrant ErbB activation ceased oligodendrocyte deaths and restored myelin development in both mice. This study suggests that aberrant ErbB activation is an upstream pathogenetic mechanism of demyelinating diseases, providing a potential therapeutic target.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primary oligodendropathy is one of the etiologic mechanisms for multiple sclerosis, and oligodendrocyte necroptosis is a pathologic hallmark in the disease. Moreover, the demyelinating disease is now a broad concept that embraces schizophrenia, in which white matter lesions are an emerging feature. ErbB overactivation has been implicated in schizophrenia by genetic analysis and postmortem studies. This study suggests the etiologic implications of ErbB overactivation in myelin pathogenesis and elucidates the pathogenetic mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity maintains network stability by adjusting excitation, inhibition, or the intrinsic excitability of neurons, but the developmental regulation and coordination of these distinct forms of homeostatic plasticity remains poorly understood. A major contributor to this information gap is the lack of a uniform paradigm for chronically manipulating activity at different developmental stages. To overcome this limitation, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to directly suppress neuronal activity in layer2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary visual cortex of either sex at two important developmental timepoints: the classic visual system critical period [CP; postnatal day 24 (P24) to P29], and adulthood (P45 to P55). We show that 24 h of DREADD-mediated activity suppression simultaneously induces excitatory synaptic scaling up and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons during the CP, consistent with previous observations using prolonged visual deprivation. Importantly, manipulations known to block these forms of homeostatic plasticity when induced pharmacologically or via visual deprivation also prevented DREADD-induced homeostatic plasticity. We next used the same paradigm to suppress activity in adult animals. Surprisingly, while excitatory synaptic scaling persisted into adulthood, intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was completely absent. Finally, we found that homeostatic changes in quantal inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons were absent during the CP but were present in adults. Thus, the same population of neurons can express distinct sets of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms at different development stages. Our findings suggest that homeostatic forms of plasticity can be recruited in a modular manner according to the evolving needs of a developing neural circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developing brain circuits are subject to dramatic changes in inputs that could destabilize activity if left uncompensated. This compensation is achieved through a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that provide slow, negative feedback adjustments to excitability. Given that circuits are subject to very different destabilizing forces during distinct developmental stages, the forms of homeostatic plasticity present in the network must be tuned to these evolving needs. Here we developed a method to induce comparable homeostatic compensation during distinct developmental windows and found that neurons in the juvenile and mature brain engage strikingly different forms of homeostatic plasticity. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms can be recruited in a modular manner according to the developmental needs of the circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for Layer-Specific Connectional Heterogeneity in the Mouse Auditory Corticocollicular System</a></h4>

              
                <p>The auditory cortex (AC) sends long-range projections to virtually all subcortical auditory structures. One of the largest and most complex of these&mdash;the projection between AC and inferior colliculus (IC; the corticocollicular pathway)&mdash;originates from layer 5 and deep layer 6. Though previous work has shown that these two corticocollicular projection systems have different physiological properties and network connectivities, their functional organization is poorly understood. Here, using a combination of traditional and viral tracers combined with <I>in vivo</I> imaging in both sexes of the mouse, we observed that layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons differ in their areas of origin and termination patterns. Layer 5 corticocollicular neurons are concentrated in primary AC, while layer 6 corticocollicular neurons emanate from broad auditory and limbic areas in the temporal cortex. In addition, layer 5 sends dense projections of both small and large (&gt;1 &micro;m<sup>2</sup> area) terminals to all regions of nonlemniscal IC, while layer 6 sends small terminals to the most superficial 50&ndash;100 &micro;m of the IC. These findings suggest that layer 5 and 6 corticocollicular projections are optimized to play distinct roles in corticofugal modulation. Layer 5 neurons provide strong, rapid, and unimodal feedback to the nonlemniscal IC, while layer 6 neurons provide heteromodal and limbic modulation diffusely to the nonlemniscal IC. Such organizational diversity in the corticocollicular pathway may help to explain the heterogeneous effects of corticocollicular manipulations and, given similar diversity in corticothalamic pathways, may be a general principle in top-down modulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We demonstrate that a major descending system in the brain is actually two systems. That is, the auditory corticocollicular projection, which exerts considerable influence over the midbrain, comprises two projections: one from layer 5 and the other from layer 6. The layer 6 projection is diffusely organized, receives multisensory inputs, and ends in small terminals; while the layer 5 projection is derived from a circumscribed auditory cortical area and ends in large terminals. These data suggest that the varied effects of cortical manipulations on the midbrain may be related to effects on two disparate systems. These findings have broader implications because other descending systems derive from two layers. Therefore, a duplex organization may be a common motif in descending control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Rhythmogenic Network States Drive Differential Opioid Responses in the In Vitro Respiratory Network</a></h4>

              
                <p>Death from opioid overdose is typically caused by opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). A particularly dangerous characteristic of OIRD is its apparent unpredictability. The respiratory consequences of opioids can be surprisingly inconsistent, even within the same individual. Despite significant clinical implications, most studies have focused on average dose&ndash;r esponses rather than individual variation, and there remains little insight into the etiology of this apparent unpredictability. The preBo&#x0308;tzinger complex (preBo&#x0308;tC) in the ventral medulla is an important site for generating the respiratory rhythm and OIRD. Here, using male and female C57-Bl6 mice <I>in vitro</I>, we demonstrate that the preBo&#x0308;tC can assume different network states depending on the excitability of the preBo&#x0308;tC and the intrinsic membrane properties of preBo&#x0308;tC neurons. These network states predict the functional consequences of opioids in the preBo&#x0308;tC, and depending on network state, respiratory rhythmogenesis can be either stabilized or suppressed by opioids. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of preBo&#x0308;tC rhythmogenic properties, required to endow breathing with remarkable flexibility, also plays a key role in the dangerous unpredictability of OIRD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioids can cause unpredictable, life-threatening suppression of breathing. This apparent unpredictability makes clinical management of opioids difficult while also making it challenging to define the underlying mechanisms of OIRD. Here, we find in brainstem slices that the preBo&#x0308;tC, an opioid-sensitive subregion of the brainstem, has an optimal configuration of cellular and network properties that results in a maximally stable breathing rhythm. These properties are dynamic, and the state of each individual preBo&#x0308;tC network relative to the optimal configuration of the network predicts how vulnerable rhythmogenesis is to the effects of opioids. These insights establish a framework for understanding how endogenous and exogenous modulation of the rhythmogenic state of the preBo&#x0308;tC can increase or decrease the risk of OIRD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Medial Entorhinal Cortex Excitatory Neurons Are Necessary for Accurate Timing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampal region has long been considered critical for memory of time, and recent evidence shows that network operations and single-unit activity in the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) correlate with elapsed time. However, whether MEC activity is necessary for timing remains largely unknown. Here we expressed DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) under the CaMKIIa promoter to preferentially target MEC excitatory neurons for chemogenetic silencing, while freely moving male rats reproduced a memorized time interval by waiting inside a region of interest. We found that such silencing impaired the reproduction of the memorized interval and led to an overestimation of elapsed time. Trial history analyses under this condition revealed a reduced influence of previous trials on current waiting times, suggesting an impairment in maintaining temporal memories across trials. Moreover, using GLM (logistic regression), we show that decoding behavioral performance from preceding waiting times was significantly compromised when MEC was silenced. In addition to revealing an important role of MEC excitatory neurons for timing behavior, our results raise the possibility that these neurons contribute to such behavior by holding temporal information across trials.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures are implicated in processing temporal information. However, little is known about the role MTL structures, such as the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, play in perceiving or reproducing temporal intervals. By chemogenetically silencing medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) excitatory activity during a timing task, we show that this structure is necessary for the accurate reproduction of temporal intervals. Furthermore, trial history analyses suggest that silencing MEC disrupts memory mechanisms during timing. Together, these results suggest that MEC is necessary for timing behavior, possibly by representing the target interval in memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Precuneal Causal Loop Mediates External and Internal Information Integration in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human brains interpret external stimuli based on internal representations. One untested hypothesis is that the default-mode network (DMN), widely considered responsible for internally oriented cognition, can decode external information. Here, we posit that the unique structural and functional fingerprint of the precuneus (PCu) supports a prominent role for the posterior part of the DMN in this process. By analyzing the imaging data of 100 participants performing two attention-demanding tasks, we found that the PCu is functionally divided into dorsal and ventral subdivisions. We then conducted a comprehensive examination of their connectivity profiles and found that at rest, both the ventral PCu (vPCu) and dorsal PCu (dPCu) are mainly connected with the DMN but also are differentially connected with internally oriented networks (IoN) and externally oriented networks (EoN). During tasks, the double associations between the v/dPCu and the IoN/EoN are correlated with task performance and can switch depending on cognitive demand. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) revealed that the strength and direction of the effective connectivity (EC) between v/dPCu is modulated by task difficulty in a manner potentially dictated by the balance of internal versus external cognitive demands. Our study provides evidence that the posterior medial part of the DMN may drive interactions between large-scale networks, potentially allowing access to stored representations for moment-to-moment interpretation of an ever-changing environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The default-mode network (DMN) is widely known for its association with internalized thinking processes, e.g., spontaneous thoughts, which is the most interesting but least understood component in human consciousness. The precuneus (PCu), a posteromedial DMN hub, is thought to play a role in this, but a mechanistic explanation has not yet been established. In this study we found that the associations between ventral PCu (vPCu)/dorsal PCu (dPCu) subdivisions and internally oriented network (IoN)/externally oriented network (EoN) are flexibly modulated by cognitive demand and correlate with task performance. We further propose that the recurrent causal connectivity between the ventral and dorsal PCu supports conscious processing by constantly interpreting external information based on an internal model, meanwhile updating the internal model with the incoming information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Range Respiratory and Theta Oscillation Networks Depend on Spatial Sensory Context</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural oscillations can couple networks of brain regions, especially at lower frequencies. The nasal respiratory rhythm, which elicits robust olfactory bulb oscillations, has been linked to episodic memory, locomotion, and exploration, along with widespread oscillatory coherence. The piriform cortex is implicated in propagating the olfactory-bulb-driven respiratory rhythm, but this has not been tested explicitly in the context of both hippocampal theta and nasal respiratory rhythm during exploratory behaviors. We investigated systemwide interactions during foraging behavior, which engages respiratory and theta rhythms. Local field potentials from the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, and CA1 of hippocampus, primary visual cortex, and nasal respiration were recorded simultaneously from male rats. We compared interactions among these areas while rats foraged using either visual or olfactory spatial cues. We found high coherence during foraging compared with home cage activity in two frequency bands that matched slow and fast respiratory rates. Piriform cortex and hippocampus maintained strong coupling at theta frequency during periods of slow respiration, whereas other pairs showed coupling only at the fast respiratory frequency. Directional analysis shows that the modality of spatial cues was matched to larger influences in the network by the respective primary sensory area. Respiratory and theta rhythms also coupled to faster oscillations in primary sensory and hippocampal areas. These data provide the first evidence of widespread interactions among nasal respiration, olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and hippocampus in awake freely moving rats, and support the piriform cortex as an integrator of respiratory and theta activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent studies have shown widespread interactions between the nasally driven respiratory rhythm and neural oscillations in hippocampus and neocortex. With this study, we address how the respiratory rhythm interacts with ongoing slow brain rhythms across olfactory, hippocampal, and visual systems in freely moving rats. Patterns of network connectivity change with behavioral state, with stronger interactions at fast and slow respiratory frequencies during foraging as compared with home cage activity. Routing of interactions between sensory cortices depends on the modality of spatial cues present during foraging. Functional connectivity and cross-frequency coupling analyses suggest strong bidirectional interactions between olfactory and hippocampal systems related to respiration and point to the piriform cortex as a key area for mediating respiratory and theta rhythms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maternal Immune Activation during Pregnancy Alters Postnatal Brain Growth and Cognitive Development in Nonhuman Primate Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human epidemiological studies implicate exposure to infection during gestation in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) have identified the maternal immune response as the critical link between maternal infection and aberrant offspring brain and behavior development. Here we evaluate neurodevelopment of male rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) born to MIA-treated dams (<I>n</I> = 14) injected with a modified form of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid at the end of the first trimester. Control dams received saline injections at the same gestational time points (<I>n</I> = 10) or were untreated (<I>n</I> = 4). MIA-treated dams exhibited a strong immune response as indexed by transient increases in sickness behavior, temperature, and inflammatory cytokines. Although offspring born to control or MIA-treated dams did not differ on measures of physical growth and early developmental milestones, the MIA-treated animals exhibited subtle changes in cognitive development and deviated from species-typical brain growth trajectories. Longitudinal MRI revealed significant gray matter volume reductions in the prefrontal and frontal cortices of MIA-treated offspring at 6 months that persisted through the final time point at 45 months along with smaller frontal white matter volumes in MIA-treated animals at 36 and 45 months. These findings provide the first evidence of early postnatal changes in brain development in MIA-exposed nonhuman primates and establish a translationally relevant model system to explore the neurodevelopmental trajectory of risk associated with prenatal immune challenge from birth through late adolescence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Women exposed to infection during pregnancy have an increased risk of giving birth to a child who will later be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Preclinical maternal immune activation (MIA) models have demonstrated that the effects of maternal infection on fetal brain development are mediated by maternal immune response. Since the majority of MIA models are conducted in rodents, the nonhuman primate provides a unique system to evaluate the MIA hypothesis in a species closely related to humans. Here we report the first longitudinal study conducted in a nonhuman primate MIA model. MIA-exposed offspring demonstrate subtle changes in cognitive development paired with marked reductions in frontal gray and white matter, further supporting the association between prenatal immune challenge and alterations in offspring neurodevelopment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contralateral Projection of Anterior Cingulate Cortex Contributes to Mirror-Image Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-term limb nerve injury often leads to mirror-image pain (MIP), an abnormal pain sensation in the limb contralateral to the injury. Although it is clear that MIP is mediated in part by central nociception processing, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key brain region that receives relayed peripheral nociceptive information from the contralateral limb. In this study, we induced MIP in male mice, in which a unilateral chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) induced a decreased nociceptive threshold in both hind limbs and an increased number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the ACC both contralateral and ipsilateral to the injured limb. Using viral-mediated projection mapping, we observed that a portion of ACC neurons formed monosynaptic connections with contralateral ACC neurons. Furthermore, the number of cross-callosal projection ACC neurons that exhibited c-Fos signal was increased in MIP-expressing mice, suggesting enhanced transmission between ACC neurons of the two hemispheres. Moreover, selective inhibition of the cross-callosal projection ACC neurons contralateral to the injured limb normalized the nociceptive sensation of the uninjured limb without affecting the increased nociceptive sensation of the injured limb in CCI mice. In contrast, inhibition of the non&ndash;cross-callosal projection ACC neurons contralateral to the injury normalized the nociceptive sensation of the injured limb without affecting the MIP exhibited in the uninjured limb. These results reveal a circuit mechanism, namely, the cross-callosal projection of ACC between two hemispheres, that contributes to MIP and possibly other forms of contralateral migration of pain sensation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mirror-image pain (MIP) refers to the increased pain sensitivity of the contralateral body part in patients with chronic pain. This pathology requires central processing, yet the mechanisms are less known. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-callosal projection neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contralateral to the injury contribute to MIP exhibited in the uninjured limb, but do not affect nociceptive sensation of the injured limb. In contrast, the non&ndash;cross-callosal projection neurons in the ACC contralateral to the injury contribute to nociceptive sensation of the injured limb, but do not affect MIP exhibited in the uninjured limb. Our study depicts a novel cross-callosal projection of ACC that contributes to MIP, providing a central mechanism for MIP in chronic pain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Arcuate Nucleus Overexpression of NHLH2 Reduces Body Mass and Attenuates Obesity-Associated Anxiety/Depression-like Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nescient helix-loop-helix 2 (NHLH2) is a hypothalamic transcription factor that controls the expression of prohormone convertase 1/3, therefore having an impact on the processing of proopiomelanocortin and thus on energy homeostasis. Studies have shown that KO of <I>Nhlh2</I> results in increased body mass, reduced physical activity, and hypogonadism. In humans, a polymorphism of the <I>NHLH2</I> gene is associated with obesity; and in Prader&ndash;Willi syndrome, a condition characterized by obesity, hypogonadism and behavioral abnormalities, the expression of NHLH2 is reduced. Despite clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that NHLH2 could be a good target for the treatment of obesity, no previous study has evaluated the impact of NHLH2 overexpression in obesity. Here, in mice fed a high-fat diet introduced right after the arcuate nucleus intracerebroventricular injection of a lentivirus that promoted 40% increase in NHLH2, there was prevention of the development of obesity by a mechanism dependent on the reduction of caloric intake. When hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 was induced in previously obese mice, the beneficial impact on obesity-associated phenotype was even greater; thus, there was an 80% attenuation in body mass gain, reduced whole-body adiposity, increased brown adipose tissue temperature, reduced hypothalamic inflammation, and reduced liver steatosis. In this setting, the beneficial impact of hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 was a result of combined effects on caloric intake, energy expenditure, and physical activity. Moreover, the hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 reduced obesity-associated anxiety/depression behavior. Thus, we provide an experimental proof of concept supporting that hypothalamic NHLH2 is a good target for the treatment of obesity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Obesity is a highly prevalent medical condition that lacks an effective treatment. The main advance provided by this study is the demonstration of the beneficial metabolic and behavioral outcomes resulting from the overexpression of NHLH2 in the hypothalamus. When NHLH2 was overexpressed simultaneously with the introduction of a high-fat diet, there was prevention of obesity by a mechanism dependent on reduced caloric intake. Conversely, when NHLH2 was overexpressed in previously obese mice, there was reduction of the obese phenotype because of a combination of reduced caloric intake, increased physical activity, and increased thermogenesis. In addition, the overexpression of NHLH2 reduced anxiety/depression-like behavior. Thus, NHLH2 emerges as a potential target for the combined treatment of obesity and its associated anxiety/depression-like behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">D2-Like Receptor Expression in the Hippocampus and Amygdala Informs Performance on the Stop-Signal Task in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The stop-signal task is a well-established assessment of response inhibition, and in humans, proficiency is linked to dorsal striatum D<SUB>2</SUB> receptor availability. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by changes to efficiency of response inhibition. Here, we studied 17 PD patients (6 female and 11 male) using the stop-signal paradigm in a single-blinded <scp>d</scp>-amphetamine (dAMPH) study. Participants completed [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride positron emission topography (PET) imaging in both placebo and dAMPH conditions. A voxel-wise analysis of the relationship between binding potential (BP<SUB>ND</SUB>) and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) revealed that faster SSRT is associated with greater D<SUB>2</SUB>-like BP<SUB>ND</SUB> in the amygdala and hippocampus (right cluster <I>q</I><SUB>FDR-corr</SUB> = 0.026, left cluster <I>q</I><SUB>FDR-corr</SUB> = 0.002). A region of interest (ROI) examination confirmed this association in both the amygdala (coefficient = &ndash;48.26, <I>p</I> = 0.005) and hippocampus (coefficient = &ndash;104.94, <I>p</I> = 0.007). As healthy dopaminergic systems in the dorsal striatum appear to regulate response inhibition, we interpret our findings in PD to indicate either nigrostriatal damage unmasking a mesolimbic contribution to response inhibition, or a compensatory adaptation from the limbic and mesial temporal dopamine systems. These novel results expand the conceptualization of action-control networks, whereby limbic and motor loops may be functionally connected.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While Parkinson's disease (PD) is characteristically recognized for its motor symptoms, some patients develop impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs), manifested as repetitive and excessive participation in reward-driven activities, including sex, gambling, shopping, eating, and hobbyism. Such cognitive alterations compel a consideration of response inhibition in PD. To investigate inhibitory control and assess the brain regions that may participate, we assessed PD patients using a single-blinded <scp>d</scp>-amphetamine (dAMPH) study, with [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride positron emission topography (PET) imaging, and stop-signal task performance. We find a negative relationship between D<SUB>2</SUB>-like binding in the mesial temporal region and top-signal reaction time (SSRT), with greater BP<SUB>ND</SUB> associated with a faster SSRT. These discoveries indicate a novel role for mesolimbic dopamine in response inhibition, and advocate for limbic regulation of action control in this clinical population.</p>

                Background: Hospitalizations of nursing home residents are associated with various health risks. Previous research indicates that, to some extent, hospitalizations of this vulnerable population may be inappropriate and even avoidable. This study aimed to develop a consensus list of hospital discharge diagnoses considered to be nursing home-sensitive, i.e., avoidable. Methods: The study combined analyses of routine data from six statutory health insurance companies in Germany and a two-stage Delphi panel, enhanced by expert workshop discussions, to identify and corroborate relevant diagnoses. Experts from four different disciplines estimated the proportion of hospitalizations that could potentially have been prevented under optimal conditions.   Results: We analyzed frequencies and costs of data for hospital admissions from 242,236 nursing home residents provided by statutory health insurance companies. We identified 117 hospital discharge diagnoses, which had a frequency of at least 0.1%. We recruited experts (primary care physicians, hospital specialists, nursing home professionals and researchers) to estimate the proportion of potentially avoidable hospitalizations for the 117 diagnoses deemed avoidable in two Delphi rounds (n=107 in Delphi Round 1 and n=96 in Delphi Round 2, effective response rate=91%). A total of 35 diagnoses with high and consistent estimates of the proportion of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were identified as nursing home-sensitive. In an expert workshop (n=16), a further 25 diagnoses were discussed that had not reached the criteria, of which another 23 were consented to be nursing home-sensitive conditions. Extrapolating the frequency and mean costs of these 58 diagnoses to the national German context yielded total potentially avoidable care costs of €768,304,547, associated with 219,955 nursing home-sensitive hospital admissions. Conclusion: A total of 58 nursing home-relevant diagnoses (ICD-10-GM three-digit level) were classified as nursing home-sensitive using an adapted Delphi procedure. Interventions should be developed to avoid hospital admission from nursing homes for these diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improved retinal vessel segmentation using the enhanced pre-processing method for high resolution fundus images [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: By diagnosing using fundus images, ophthalmologists can possibly detect symptoms of retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal detachment. A number of studies have also found some links between fundus image analysis data and other underlying systemic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and kidney dysfunction. Now that imaging technology is advancing further, more fundus cameras are currently equipped with the capability to produce high resolution fundus images. One of the public databases for high-resolution fundus images called High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) is consistently used for validating vessel segmentation algorithms. However, it is noticed that the segmentation outputs from the HRF database normally include noisy pixels near the upper and lower edges of the image. In this study, we propose an enhanced method of pre-processing the images so that these noisy pixels can be eliminated, and thus the overall segmentation performance can be increased. Without eliminating the noisy pixels, the visual segmentation output shows a large number of false positive pixels near the top and bottom edges. Methods: The proposed method involves adding additional padding to the image before the segmentation procedure is applied. In this study, the Bar-Combination Of Shifted FIlter REsponses (B-COSFIRE) filter is used for retinal vessel segmentation. Results: Qualitative assessment of the segmentation results when using the proposed method showed improvement in terms of noisy pixel removal from near the edges. Quantitatively, the additional padding step improves all considered metrics for vessel segmentation, namely Sensitivity (73.76%), Specificity (97.53%), and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) value (71.57%) for the HRF database. Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate improvement in the overall segmentation performance when using the proposed double-padding method of pre-processing the fundus image prior to segmentation. In the future, more databases with various resolutions and modalities can be included for further validation.

Realistic models of biological processes typically involve interacting components on multiple scales, driven by changing environment and inherent stochasticity. Such models are often analytically and numerically intractable. We revisit a dynamic maximum entropy method that combines a static maximum entropy with a quasi-stationary approximation. This allows us to reduce stochastic non-equilibrium dynamics expressed by the Fokker-Planck equation to a simpler low-dimensional deterministic dynamics, without the need to track microscopic details. Although the method has been previously applied to a few (rather complicated) applications in population genetics, our main goal here is to explain and to better understand how the method works. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method for two widely studied stochastic problems, highlighting its accuracy in capturing important macroscopic quantities even in rapidly changing non-stationary conditions. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the method recovers the exact dynamics whilst for a stochastic island model with migration from other habitats, the approximation retains high macroscopic accuracy under a wide range of scenarios in a dynamic environment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">When and why direct transmission models can be used for environmentally persistent pathogens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lee Benson, Ross S. Davidson, Darren M. Green, Andrew Hoyle, Mike R. Hutchings, Glenn Marion</p>

Variants of the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model of Kermack & McKendrick (1927) enjoy wide application in epidemiology, offering simple yet powerful inferential and predictive tools in the study of diverse infectious diseases across human, animal and plant populations. Direct transmission models (DTM) are a subset of these that treat the processes of disease transmission as comprising a series of discrete instantaneous events. Infections transmitted indirectly by persistent environmental pathogens, however, are examples where a DTM description might fail and are perhaps better described by models that comprise explicit environmental transmission routes, so-called environmental transmission models (ETM). In this paper we discuss the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) DTM and susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-pathogen (SEIR-P) ETM and we show that the former is the timescale separation limit of the latter, with ETM host-disease dynamics increasingly resembling those of a DTM when the pathogen’s characteristic timescale is shortened, relative to that of the host population. Using graphical posterior predictive checks (GPPC), we investigate the validity of the SEIR model when fitted to simulated SEIR-P host infection and removal times. Such analyses demonstrate how, in many cases, the SEIR model is robust to departure from direct transmission. Finally, we present a case study of white spot disease (WSD) in penaeid shrimp with rates of environmental transmission and pathogen decay (SEIR-P model parameters) estimated using published results of experiments. Using SEIR and SEIR-P simulations of a hypothetical WSD outbreak management scenario, we demonstrate how relative shortening of the pathogen timescale comes about in practice. With atttempts to remove diseased shrimp from the population every 24h, we see SEIR and SEIR-P model outputs closely conincide. However, when removals are 6-hourly, the two models’ mean outputs diverge, with distinct predictions of outbreak size and duration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA editing regulates lncRNA splicing in human early embryo development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiajun Qiu, Xiao Ma, Fanyi Zeng, Jingbin Yan</p>

RNA editing is a co- or post-transcriptional modification through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences within an RNA molecule after transcription. Previous studies found that RNA editing may be critically involved in cancer and aging. However, the function of RNA editing in human early embryo development is still unclear. In this study, through analyzing single cell RNA sequencing data, 36.7% RNA editing sites were found to have a have differential editing ratio among early embryo developmental stages, and there was a great reprogramming of RNA editing rates at the 8-cell stage, at which most of the differentially edited RNA editing sites (99.2%) had a decreased RNA editing rate. In addition, RNA editing was more likely to occur on RNA splicing sites during human early embryo development. Furthermore, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) editing sites were found more likely to be on RNA splicing sites (odds ratio = 2.19, P = 1.37×10<sup>−8</sup>), while mRNA editing sites were less likely (odds ratio = 0.22, P = 8.38×10<sup>−46</sup>). Besides, we found that the RNA editing rate on lncRNA had a significantly higher correlation coefficient with the percentage spliced index (PSI) of lncRNA exons (R = 0.75, P = 4.90×10<sup>−16</sup>), which indicated that RNA editing may regulate lncRNA splicing during human early embryo development. Finally, functional analysis revealed that those RNA editing-regulated lncRNAs were enriched in signal transduction, the regulation of transcript expression, and the transmembrane transport of mitochondrial calcium ion. Overall, our study might provide a new insight into the mechanism of RNA editing on lncRNAs in human developmental biology and common birth defects.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Although autoimmunity has been postulated to be pathophysiologically important in SFN, few autoantibodies have been described. We aimed to identify autoantibodies associated with idiopathic SFN (iSFN) by a novel high-throughput protein microarray platform that captures autoantibodies expressed in the native conformational state.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sera from 58 SFN patients and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were screened against &gt;1,600 immune-related antigens. Fluorescent unit readout and postassay imaging were performed, followed by composite data normalization and protein fold change (pFC) analysis. Analysis of an independent validation cohort of 33 SFN patients against the same 20 HCs was conducted to identify reproducible proteins in both cohorts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine autoantibodies were screened with statistical significance and pFC criteria in both cohorts, with at least 50% change in serum levels. Three proteins showed consistently high fold changes in main and validation cohorts: MX1 (FC = 2.99 and 3.07, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.003, <i>q</i> = 0.076), DBNL (FC = 2.11 and 2.16, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.009, <i>q</i> &lt; 0.003), and KRT8 (FC = 1.65 and 1.70, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.043, <i>q</i> &lt; 0.003). Further subgroup analysis into iSFN and SFN by secondary causes (secondary SFN) in the main cohort showed that MX1 is higher in iSFN compared to secondary SFN (FC = 1.61 vs 0.106, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel autoantibodies MX1, DBNL, and KRT8 are found in iSFN. MX1 may allow diagnostic subtyping of iSFN patients. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural analysis of the morphological phenotypes of microglia associated with neuroinflammatory cues"/>
<p>We used a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image analysis to characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuroinflammatory cues. The C20 human microglia cell line was stimulated by antiinflammatory (IL-4), proinflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ), and the resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain (higher-order branching of processes and surface topography) were analyzed. The use of SEM enabled the characterization of microglia morphology in resolving fine details about microglia ultrastructure that were previously unappreciated.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that are responsible for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. There is a plethora of evidence to suggest that microglia display distinct phenotypes that are associated with the alteration of cell morphology under varying environmental cues. However, it has not been fully explored how the varying states of microglial activation are linked to the alteration of microglia morphology, especially in the microdomain. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuroinflammatory cues. To address this, a human cell line of microglia was stimulated by antiinflammatory (IL-4), proinflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ, Aβ + TNF-α). The resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain were analyzed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Our findings demonstrated that microglial activation under proinflammatory and AD-cues were closely linked to changes not only in cell shape but also in cell surface topography and higher-order branching of processes. Furthermore, our results revealed that microglia under proinflammatory cues exhibited unique morphological features involving cell-to-cell contact and the formation of vesicle-like structures. Our study provides insight into the fine details of microglia morphology associated with varying status of microglial activation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Priorities for research in child and adolescent anxiety and depression: a priority setting partnership with youth and professionals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A starting point for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments should be to identify evidence gaps. Furthermore, such evaluations should consider the perspectives of patients, clinicians and carers to ensure relevance and potentially influence future research initiatives. Methods: Our approach, inspired by the James Lind Alliance methods, involved three steps. First, we performed a document analysis by identifying interventions and outcomes in two recently published overviews of systematic reviews, which summarised the effects of interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Second, we surveyed children and adolescents with personal experiences of depression or anxiety as well as clinicians, and asked them to suggest treatments and outcomes associated with uncertainty. Finally, we facilitated a consensus process where clinicians and youth mental health patient representatives were invited to prioritise research uncertainties in separate consensus processes. Results: The survey included 674 respondents who reported a total of 1267 uncertainties. Independent coding by four investigators revealed 134 suggestions for treatments of anxiety, 90 suggestions for treatments of depression, 84 for outcomes of interventions for anxiety and 71 suggestions for outcomes of interventions for depression. Two separate priority setting workshops with eight clinicians and ten youth resulted in four independent top ten priority lists. Conclusion: Top ten lists of treatments and outcome domains of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents was identified by youth and clinicians. The results may influence the research agenda, and ultimately benefit patients.

                Ludwig’s angina (LA) is a rapidly spreading and potentially life-threatening infection having an odontogenic infection as the most common source. It involves the floor of the mouth and neck. Modernization in medical care has made this entity rare and of low mortality at the present but it is still feared as a lethal entity due to rapidly progressive airway obstruction that follows. Here we report a case of a 15-year-old male who suffered from LA. Presenting symptoms and findings of the examination helped in the clinical diagnosis. Immediate intubation, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatment of complications aided the patient’s recovery. LA should be considered for differential diagnosis in the case of neck swelling especially in those having a history of poor oral hygiene and recent dental procedures. Management of LA and its complications should always involve doctors from multiple disciplines.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite the prevalence and public health impact of substance use disorders (SUDs), effective long-term treatments remain elusive. Aerobic exercise is a promising, nonpharmacological treatment currently under investigation as a strategy for preventing drug relapse. Aerobic exercise could be incorporated into the comprehensive treatment regimens for people with substance abuse disorders. Preclinical studies of SUD with animal models have shown that aerobic exercise diminishes drug-seeking behavior, which leads to relapse, in both male and female rats. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the effects of substance abuse-induced cellular and physiological adaptations believed to be responsible for drug-seeking behavior. Accordingly, the overall goal of this review is to provide a summary and an assessment of findings to date, highlighting evidence of the molecular and neurological effects of exercise on adaptations associated with SUD.</p>

     alt="Input and output organization of the mesodiencephalic junction for cerebro-cerebellar communication"/>
<p>Using classical and transneuronal tracing approaches as well as analyzing mesoscale data of the Allen Brain atlas, we uncovered the precise topography of the inputs and outputs of mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ). Our work highlights how cerebral cortical information is relayed onto the olivocerebellar system via the MDJ.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Most studies investigating the impact of the cerebral cortex (CC) onto the cerebellum highlight the role of the pons, which provides the mossy fibers to the cerebellum. However, cerebro-cerebellar communication may also be mediated by the nuclei of the mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ) that project to the inferior olive (IO), which in turn provides the climbing fibers to the molecular layer. Here, we uncover the precise topographic relations of the inputs and outputs of the MDJ using multiple, classical, and transneuronal tracing methods as well as analyses of mesoscale cortical injections from Allen Mouse Brain. We show that the caudal parts of the CC predominantly project to the principal olive via the rostral MDJ and that the rostral parts of the CC predominantly project to the rostral medial accessory olive via the caudal MDJ. Moreover, using triple viral tracing technology, we show that the cerebellar nuclei directly innervate the neurons in the MDJ that receive input from CC and project to the IO. By unraveling these topographic and prominent, mono- and disynaptic projections through the MDJ, this work establishes that cerebro-cerebellar communication is not only mediated by the pontine mossy fiber system, but also by the climbing fiber system.</p>

<p>Adolescent mild traumatic brain injury resulted in depression-like behavior in female rats during estrus phase of the estrous cycle. Pharmacological antagonism of progesterone and estrogen receptors during the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle prevented the expression of depression-like behavior in estrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), high school and collegiate-aged females tend to report more emotional symptoms than males. Adolescent male and female rats (35 days old) were subjected to mild TBI and evaluated for anxiety- and depression-like behaviors using the elevated plus maze and forced swim test (FST), respectively, and cellular alterations. Injured brains did not exhibit an overt lesion, atrophy of tissue or astrocytic reactivity underneath the impact site at 6-week post-injury, suggestive of the mild nature of trauma. Neither male nor female brain-injured rats exhibited anxiety-like behavior at 2 or 6 weeks, regardless of estrous phase at the time of behavior testing. Brain-injured male rats did not exhibit any alterations in immobility, swimming and climbing times in the FST compared to sham-injured rats at either 2- or 6-week post-injury. Brain-injured female rats did, however, exhibit an increase in immobility (in the absence of changes in swimming and climbing times) in the FST at 6 weeks post-injury only during the estrus phase of the estrous cycle, suggestive of a depression-like phenotype. Combined administration of the estrogen receptor antagonist, tamoxifen, and the progesterone receptor antagonist, mifepristone, during proestrus was able to prevent the depression-like phenotype observed during estrus. Taken together, these data suggest that female rats may be more vulnerable to exhibiting behavioral deficits following mild TBI and that estrous phase may play a role in depression-like behavior.</p>

<p>White matter confounds including the optic tract, fornix, and mammillothalamic tract display one of the remaining shortcomings of accurate hypothalamus segmentation. We demonstrate that qMRI can help tackle these problems using a standardized segmentation procedure.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Since the hypothalamus is involved in many neuroendocrine, metabolic, and affective disorders, detailed hypothalamic imaging has become of major interest to better characterize disease-induced tissue damages and abnormalities. Still, image contrast of conventional anatomical magnetic resonance imaging lacks morphological detail, thus complicating complete and precise segmentation of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus' position lateral to the third ventricle and close proximity to white matter tracts including the optic tract, fornix, and mammillothalamic tract display one of the remaining shortcomings of hypothalamic segmentation, as reliable exclusion of white matter is not yet possible. Recent studies found that quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI), a method to create maps of different standardized tissue contents, improved segmentation of cortical and subcortical brain regions. So far, this has not been tested for the hypothalamus. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the usability of qMRI and diffusion MRI for the purpose of detailed and reproducible manual segmentation of the hypothalamus and data-driven white matter extraction and compared our results to recent state-of-the-art segmentations. Our results show that qMRI presents good contrast for delineation of the hypothalamus and white matter, and that the properties of these images differ between subunits, such that they can be used to reliably exclude white matter from hypothalamic tissue. We propose that qMRI poses a useful addition to detailed hypothalamic segmentation and volumetry.</p>
