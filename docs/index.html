                Background In this Bioinformatics study, we took in account the cell types variation of tumor microenvironment (TME) in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with a particular attention to miRNAs dysregulated pathways influencing immune responses, and especially memory CD4+ T cells. Methods For cell types and differentially expressed genes in memory CD4+ T cells, scRNA-seq was conducted on PDAC and non-tumoral pancreas samples. Putative miRNA targeting sequences on downregulated genes were investigated by three prediction databases, MiRWalk, TargetScan, and miRDB, and compared to GSE207345’s differential expression with creation of Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array. The miRNA–mRNA interaction network was established in Cytoscape. Results Memory CD4+ T cells were significantly enriched in PDAC TME. At the same time, we observed genotype-specific repression of major immune and metabolic genes in these cells. Some miRNAs were significantly overexpressed in PDAC, and hsa-miR-1207-5p, hsa-miR-6805-5p, and hsa-miR-149-3p might target many immune-related or pancreatic enzyme-associated genes. Of these, a core of CLPS, NR4A2, and SOCS3 was most frequently targeted, which likely indicated the importance of these genes in immune evasion. Conclusions While memory CD4+ T cells exist within the PDAC TME, their activity is suppressed by miRNA-associated gene dysregulation. These data suggest candidate therapeutic approaches in which targeting of miRNAs could be used to normalize immune cells and promote anti-tumor immunity.

                arXiv:2512.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced rank regression (RRR) is a statistical method for finding a low-dimensional linear mapping between a set of high-dimensional inputs and outputs. In recent years, RRR has found numerous applications in neuroscience, in particular for identifying "communication subspaces" governing the interactions between brain regions. This tutorial article seeks to provide an introduction to RRR and its mathematical foundations, with a particular emphasis on neural communication. We discuss RRR's relationship to alternate dimensionality reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), principal components analysis (PCA), principal components regression (PCR), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We also derive important extensions to RRR, including ridge regularization and non-spherical noise. Finally, we introduce new metrics for quantifying communication strength as well as the alignment between communication axes and the principal modes of neural activity. By the end of this article, readers should have a clear understanding of RRR and the practical considerations involved in applying it to their own data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12767">Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12802">A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness: The Necessity of Continual Learning for Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirements for a falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness significantly constrain such theories. Specifically, recent research on the Unfolding Argument and the Substitution Argument has given us formal tools to analyze requirements for a theory of consciousness. I show via a new Proximity Argument that these requirements especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13052">Macular: a multi-scale simulation platform for the retina and the primary visual system</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed Macular, a simulation platform with a graphical interface, designed to produce in silico experiment scenarios for the retina and the primary visual system. A scenario consists of generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of 'cell' in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). The inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software, or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows natural or altered conditions (pharmacology, pathology, development) to be simulated.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13517">A Deep Learning Model of Mental Rotation Informed by Interactive VR Experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental rotation -- the ability to compare objects seen from different viewpoints -- is a fundamental example of mental simulation and spatial world modelling in humans. Here we propose a mechanistic model of human mental rotation, leveraging advances in deep, equivariant, and neuro-symbolic learning. Our model consists of three stacked components: (1) an equivariant neural encoder, taking images as input and producing 3D spatial representations of objects, (2) a neuro-symbolic object encoder, deriving symbolic descriptions of objects from these spatial representations, and (3) a neural decision agent, comparing these symbolic descriptions to prescribe rotation simulations in 3D latent space via a recurrent pathway. Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation. Our model captures well the performance, response times and behavior of participants in our and others' experiments. The necessity of each model component is shown through systematic ablations. Our work adds to a recent collection of deep neural models of human spatial reasoning, further demonstrating the potency of integrating deep, equivariant, and symbolic representations to model the human mind.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13539">Altered oscillatory brain networks during emotional face processing in ADHD: an eLORETA and functional ICA study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by executive dysfunction and difficulties in processing emotional facial expressions, yet the large-scale neural dynamics underlying these impairments remain insufficiently understood. This study applied network-based EEG source analysis to examine oscillatory cortical activity during cognitive and emotional Go/NoGo tasks in individuals with ADHD. EEG data from 272 participants (ADHD n equals 102, controls n equals 170, age range 6 to 60 years) were analyzed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography combined with functional independent component analysis, yielding ten frequency-resolved cortical networks. Mixed-effects ANCOVAs were conducted on independent component loadings with Group, Task, and Condition as factors and age and sex as covariates. ADHD participants showed statistically significant but small increases in activation across several networks, including a gamma-dominant inferior temporal component showing a Group effect and a Group by Condition interaction with stronger NoGo-related activation in ADHD. Two additional components showed similar but weaker NoGo-selective patterns. A main effect of Task emerged only for one temporal delta component, with higher activation during the VCPT than the ECPT. No Group by Task interactions were observed. Behavioral results replicated the established ADHD performance profile, with slower responses, greater variability, and higher error rates, particularly during the emotional ECPT. Overall, the findings reveal subtle alterations in oscillatory brain networks during inhibitory processing in ADHD, with modest effect sizes embedded within substantial within-group variability. These results support a dimensional view of ADHD neurobiology and highlight the limited discriminative power of network-level EEG markers.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12135">BaRISTA: Brain Scale Informed Spatiotemporal Representation of Human Intracranial Neural Activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12461">Cross-Modal Representational Knowledge Distillation for Enhanced Spike-Informed LFP Modeling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.12461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) can be routinely recorded alongside spiking activity in intracortical neural experiments, measure a larger complementary spatiotemporal scale of brain activity for scientific inquiry, and can offer practical advantages over spikes, including greater long-term stability, robustness to electrode degradation, and lower power requirements. Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12462">Dynamical modeling of nonlinear latent factors in multiscale neural activity with real-time inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time decoding of target variables from multiple simultaneously recorded neural time-series modalities, such as discrete spiking activity and continuous field potentials, is important across various neuroscience applications. However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12881">Unsupervised learning of multiscale switching dynamical system models from multimodal neural data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural population activity often exhibits regime-dependent non-stationarity in the form of switching dynamics. Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models are useless for linguistics, as they are probabilistic models that require a vast amount of data to analyse externalized strings of words. In contrast, human language is underpinned by a mind-internal computational system that recursively generates hierarchical thought structures. The language system grows with minimal external input and can readily distinguish between real language and impossible languages.

Abstract: In early childhood education, accurately detecting collaborative and behavioral engagement is essential to foster meaningful learning experiences. This paper presents an AI driven approach that leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to automatically classify children s engagement using visual cues such as gaze direction, interaction, and peer collaboration. Utilizing the ChildPlay gaze dataset, our method is trained on annotated video segments to classify behavioral and collaborative engagement states (e.g., engaged, not engaged, collaborative, not collaborative). We evaluated six state of the art transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), Swin Transformer, VitGaze, APVit and GazeTR. Among these, the Swin Transformer achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 97.58 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling local and global attention. Our results highlight the potential of transformer based architectures for scalable, automated engagement analysis in real world educational settings.

Abstract: Scalable assessments of mental illness, the leading driver of disability worldwide, remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that human-computer interactions encode mental health with state-of-the-art biomarker precision. We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA to predict 1.3 million mental-health self-reports from 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings recorded in 9,000 online participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. By extracting non-verbal signatures of psychological function that have so far remained untapped, MAILA represents a key step toward foundation models for mental health. The ability to decode mental states at zero marginal cost creates new opportunities in neuroscience, medicine, and public health, while raising urgent questions about privacy, agency, and autonomy online.

                arXiv:2402.15480v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From falcons spotting preys to humans recognizing faces, rapid visual abilities depend on a foveated retinal organization which delivers high-acuity central vision while preserving low-resolution periphery. This organization is conserved along early visual pathways but remains underexplored in machine learning. Here we examine how embedding a foveated retinotopic transformation as a preprocessing layer impacts convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. By applying a log-polar mapping to off-the-shelf models and retraining them, we retain comparable accuracy while improving robustness to scale and rotation. We show that this architecture becomes highly sensitive to fixation-point shifts, and that this sensitivity yields a proxy for defining saliency maps that effectively facilitates object localization. Our results show that foveated retinotopy encodes prior geometric knowledge, offering a solution to visual-search and enhancing both classification and localization. These findings connect biological vision principles with artificial networks, pointing to new, robust and efficient directions for computer-vision systems.

Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.

Abstract: Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator crunches numbers more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and require GPUs for the multiplication of huge matrices. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) of the brain have no matrix multiplication and much smaller energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a framework for thinking about popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This offers a way to convert AI models into a novel type of architecture with the promise of a thousandfold improvement in efficiency.

Abstract: We present a genetic algorithm framework for automatically discovering deep learning optimization algorithms. Our approach encodes optimizers as genomes that specify combinations of primitive update terms (gradient, momentum, RMS normalization, Adam-style adaptive terms, and sign-based updates) along with hyperparameters and scheduling options. Through evolutionary search over 50 generations with a population of 50 individuals, evaluated across multiple vision tasks, we discover an evolved optimizer that outperforms Adam by 2.6% in aggregate fitness and achieves a 7.7% relative improvement on CIFAR-10. The evolved optimizer combines sign-based gradient terms with adaptive moment estimation, uses lower momentum coefficients than Adam ($\beta_1$=0.86, $\beta_2$=0.94), and notably disables bias correction while enabling learning rate warmup and cosine decay. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary search can discover competitive optimization algorithms and reveal design principles that differ from hand-crafted optimizers.

                arXiv:2512.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control policies in deep reinforcement learning are often implemented with fixed-capacity multilayer perceptrons trained by backpropagation, which lack structural plasticity and depend on global error signals. This paper introduces the Self-Motivated Growing Neural Network (SMGrNN), a controller whose topology evolves online through a local Structural Plasticity Module (SPM). The SPM monitors neuron activations and edge-wise weight update statistics over short temporal windows and uses these signals to trigger neuron insertion and pruning, while synaptic weights are updated by a standard gradient-based optimizer. This allows network capacity to be regulated during learning without manual architectural tuning.
  SMGrNN is evaluated on control benchmarks via policy distillation. Compared with multilayer perceptron baselines, it achieves similar or higher returns, lower variance, and task-appropriate network sizes. Ablation studies with growth disabled and growth-only variants isolate the role of structural plasticity, showing that adaptive topology improves reward stability. The local and modular design of SPM enables future integration of a Hebbian plasticity module and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, so that SMGrNN can support both artificial and spiking neural implementations driven by local rules.

                arXiv:2512.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box optimization often relies on evolutionary and swarm algorithms whose performance is highly problem dependent. We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.

                arXiv:2512.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising language models (DLMs) have been proposed as a powerful alternative to traditional language models (LMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), motivated by their ability to use bidirectional context and adapt to a specific ASR model's error patterns. However, the complexity of the DLM training pipeline has hindered wider investigation. This paper presents the first independent, large-scale empirical study of DLMs. We build and release a complete, reproducible pipeline to systematically investigate the impact of key design choices. We evaluate dozens of configurations across multiple axes, including various data augmentation techniques (e.g., SpecAugment, dropout, mixup), different text-to-speech systems, and multiple decoding strategies. Our comparative analysis in a common subword vocabulary setting demonstrates that DLMs outperform traditional LMs, but only after a distinct compute tipping point. While LMs are more efficient at lower budgets, DLMs scale better with longer training, mirroring behaviors observed in diffusion language models. However, we observe smaller improvements than those reported in prior character-based work, which indicates that the DLM's performance is conditional on factors such as the vocabulary. Our analysis reveals that a key factor for improving performance is to condition the DLM on richer information from the ASR's hypothesis space, rather than just a single best guess. To this end, we introduce DLM-sum, a novel method for decoding from multiple ASR hypotheses, which consistently outperforms the previously proposed DSR decoding method. We believe our findings and public pipeline provide a crucial foundation for the community to better understand, improve, and build upon this promising class of models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11835">A Monad-Based Clause Architecture for Artificial Age Score (AAS) in Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as powerful yet opaque systems, leaving open how their internal memory and "self-like" behavior should be governed in a principled and auditable way. The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.

                arXiv:2512.11851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether attention key value (KV) states computed for one prompt for a small LLM can be reused to accelerate inference on a new similar prompt, giving an increase to the space to its context memory using an approach called token recycling. Using a standard Hugging Face setup with DialoGPT-medium (a 345M parameter GPT-2 style decoder trained on 147M Reddit exchanges, 2005 to 2017) as the testbed, we build a cache of past activations and get entries by sentence embeddings, then reuse cached past key values when the cached prompt is an exact prefix of the new input. We compare recycled vs. baseline runs on latency and output fidelity, and log reuse depth in tokens. Reproducibility requires no model modifications, cached KVs are serialized to the CPU, reloaded, and supplied to the generate function to continue decoding from the cached prefix. In tests, we observe consistent speedups when prefix overlap exists, with no material degradation in output semantics, and when overlap is absent, behavior matches baseline.

                arXiv:2512.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasting is essential in banking, investment, and risk management, because expectations about future market movements directly influence current decisions. This study proposes a hybrid modelling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short Term Memory neural network. The SV model improves statistical precision and captures latent volatility dynamics, especially in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model's ability to detect complex nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one step ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. The results show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the standalone SV and LSTM models and contributes to the development of volatility modelling techniques, providing a foundation for improving risk assessment and strategic investment planning in the context of the S and P 500.

Abstract: Memristor-based in-memory computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to overcome the constraints of the von Neumann bottleneck and the memory wall by enabling fully parallelisable and energy-efficient vector-matrix multiplications. We investigate the effect of nonlinear, memristor-driven weight updates on the convergence behaviour of neural networks trained with equilibrium propagation (EqProp). Six memristor models were characterised by their voltage-current hysteresis and integrated into the EBANA framework for evaluation on two benchmark classification tasks. EqProp can achieve robust convergence under nonlinear weight updates, provided that memristors exhibit a sufficiently wide resistance range of at least an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Efforts to improve Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) with architectural enhancements have been stymied by the complexity those enhancements bring, undermining the interpretability that makes KANs attractive in the first place. Here we study overprovisioned architectures combined with sparsification to learn compact, interpretable KANs without sacrificing accuracy. Crucially, we focus on differentiable sparsification, turning architecture search into an end-to-end optimization problem. Across function approximation benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, we demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy while discovering substantially smaller models. Overprovisioning and sparsification are synergistic, with the combination outperforming either alone. The result is a principled path toward models that are both more expressive and more interpretable, addressing a key tension in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: In this work, we present the physics-informed neural network (PINN) model applied particularly to dynamic problems in solid mechanics. We focus on forward and inverse problems. Particularly, we show how a PINN model can be used efficiently for material identification in a dynamic setting. In this work, we assume linear continuum elasticity. We show results for two-dimensional (2D) plane strain problem and then we proceed to apply the same techniques for a three-dimensional (3D) problem. As for the training data we use the solution based on the finite element method. We rigorously show that PINN models are accurate, robust and computationally efficient, especially as a surrogate model for material identification problems. Also, we employ state-of-the-art techniques from the PINN literature which are an improvement to the vanilla implementation of PINN. Based on our results, we believe that the framework we have developed can be readily adapted to computational platforms for solving multiple dynamic problems in solid mechanics.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of these algorithms increases with the problem size and/or solution space. And, to get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are now-a-days working on design and development of parallel versions of state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a CUDA-based parallelization of state-of-the-art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer leveraging GPU acceleration. We implement both the existing sequential version and the proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer for a performance comparison. Our experimental results calculated over a set of CEC2022 benchmark functions demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up is achieved with proposed parallel version. We also use a real world application, i.e., Image Thresholding to compare both algorithms.

Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.

                arXiv:2512.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework linking evolutionary computation to statistical physics by formulating optimization as a statistical phase transition. We propose Wasserstein Evolution (WE), an algorithm based on the Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy functional, translating the physical competition between exploitative potential gradient forces and explorative entropic forces into an adaptive search mechanism. Theoretical analysis confirms WE's convergence to the Boltzmann distribution, ensuring a principled performance-diversity balance.Experiments compare WE against five established algorithms, including GA, DE, CMA-ES, JADE, and SaDE, on benchmark and physical potential functions. Results demonstrate that WE consistently achieves the lowest free energy and maintains the highest entropy, excelling in both solution quality and diversity preservation. Additional invariance tests using transformed Schwefel 2.22 functions verify that WE possesses translation, scale, and rotation invariance, proving its robustness and intrinsic alignment with the problem's geometry rather than its coordinate representation.Thus, this work delivers not only an effective and robust optimizer but also a new theoretical paradigm for understanding population-based search through statistical physics, viewing convergence as a disorder-to-order phase transition and opening new avenues for designing intelligent optimization methods.

                arXiv:2509.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) enable programmatic control of the functions and services in a computer network. By leveraging Software Defined Networking to control the links between virtualised network functions, SFCs provide a scalable approach to dealing with the increased pressures on network operation and management. However, embedding SFCs onto the underlying physical network and compute infrastructure is an NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used to address this issue, but they require significant time to evaluate solution quality (fitness) online, with most existing approaches instead adopting offline simulations or analytical evaluations.
  To enable online use of GAs in solving the SFC embedding problem, we introduce a hybrid online-offline approach to efficiently evaluate the fitness of generated solutions. At the core of this is BENNS: a surrogate model that approximates fitness and is agnostic to topology, traffic, and SFC-embedding. We evaluate our approach in a static environment across five experiments, varying available resources and traffic loads, and in a dynamic network environment. Our results demonstrate that our approach is capable of exploring thousands of potential configurations and generating deployable solutions in 19.1 minutes on average, compared to online-only approaches, which take 17.8 hours on average to explore ten solutions in our experiments and do not converge on an optimal solution.

Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.

Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.

Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

                arXiv:2512.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

                Background Fuzzy soft sets are well-established for decision-making under uncertainty. However, integrating soft set theory with fuzzy codes remains unexplored, as fuzzy soft code sets have not addressed these concepts. This study presents novel fuzzy soft codes and discusses their application in diagnosing medical conditions and decision-making, bridging a critical gap in the literature. Methods Numerous scholars have examined fuzzy sets, fuzzy codes, and the theory of fuzzy soft sets and their applications over the years. This paper introduces the novel concept of fuzzy soft codes by combining fuzzy soft set theory with the notion of fuzzy codes, inspired by Ozkan’s 2002 definition of fuzzy codes. Results We define fuzzy soft codes as a parameterized family of fuzzy codes, detailing their matrix representation, set-theoretic operations, and algebraic properties. A new decision-making method using choice and score values from comparison tables is introduced. An example demonstrates its effectiveness for selecting optimal objects, proving its real-world potential in areas like medical diagnosis. This bridges a key theoretical gap and enables future extensions like intuitionistic fuzzy soft codes. Conclusions This study addresses a gap in the integration of soft set theory with the notion of fuzzy codes. The primary objective is to introduce the concept of fuzzy soft codes within the context of decision-making by merging fundamental ideas from soft set theory and fuzzy coding, while also examining several of their key properties. Additionally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate how this approach can be effectively utilized across a range of real world problem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1402/v1?src=rss">A New Analytical Method for Solving the Fractional Swift-Hohenberg Equation with Atangana-Baleanu Derivative [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This work introduces a hybrid analytical technique for solving the Swift–Hohenberg equation by integrating the newly formulated Yasser–Jassim integral transform with the variational iteration method. The proposed framework is designed to efficiently handle both the classical and fractional forms of the equation, providing fast-convergent and highly accurate approximate solutions. To capture memory effects and nonlocal features more realistically, the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative in the Caputo sense is incorporated into the model. A rigorous convergence analysis is conducted, establishing sufficient conditions to ensure the stability, reliability, and accuracy of the iterative solutions. The performance of the method is assessed through a setiries of numerical experiments supported by graphical illustrations and tables of absolute error values, which collectively confirm the method’s superior accuracy and rapid convergence when compared with standard analytical approaches. Additionally, a detailed stability study of the fractional solutions is carried out and clearly verified through analytical arguments and numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the combined Yasser–Jassim transform and variational iteration method offer a versatile and powerful tool for solving fractional-order partial differential equations. Beyond the Swift–Hohenberg equation, the proposed approach can be extended to a wide range of mathematical models, including nonlinear ordinary differential equations and integro-differential systems. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of this hybrid scheme to advance analytical methodologies within fractional calculus and nonlinear dynamical systems.

                Background Clinical laboratories play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver timely results. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the workload in clinical laboratory staff using Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method, focusing on workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements to optimize staffing levels and ensure an efficient clinical laboratory environment. Annual clinical laboratory data from June 2021 to May 2023 were collected to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff (n=33, complete enumeration) from the laboratory registers and hospital statistics. WISN software was used to calculate staffing requirements, workload pressure, and WISN ratio. The Shapiro–Wilk test assessed normality and the Kruskal–Wallis test evaluated differences across clinical laboratory sections. Result A total of 33 technical staff employed, performed approximately 3.7 million tests across hematology and clinical pathology during the study period, WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel, indicating a shortfall of 13.3 staff (28.3%). A p < 0.01 confirmed a significant disparity in workload distribution. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence-based staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1368/v2?src=rss">Performance of Forensic Age Estimation by Aspartic Acid Racemization and DNA Methylation: A Systematic Review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forensic age estimation is not difficult when the body is found in good condition, but in cases of severe decomposition or damage, such as burnt or separated body parts, then the analysis can only be done with bones and teeth. There has been abundant research and development in the field of related biochemistry over the years. Various molecular changes occur in hard tissues and long-lived proteins, such as those in bones and teeth during the physiological process of aging. Aspartic acid racemization and DNA methylation are still the most frequently used age estimation methods because of their advantages in accuracy. Method This study aimed to compare the accuracy of DNA methylation and aspartic acid racemization methods for age estimation. Journal articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar of 2017-2022 according to PRISMA guidelines. Result Twelve journal articles were eligible for review. The DNA methylation method is quite simple to use because of commercially available methylation kits. Furthermore, the results can be obtained relatively quickly without requiring many samples, and the method is less sensitive to thermal and other damage than the aspartic acid racemization method. Conclusion The aspartic acid racemization method for age estimation has high accuracy, especially in determining age at death. However, temperature and the condition of the teeth affect the racemization of aspartic acid. Given that DNA methylation is generally stable in a wide range of temperatures, it provides a better approach to determining the chronological age even from charred remains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105271">Strikingly different neurotransmitter release strategies in dopaminergic subclasses</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal function is intimately tied to axodendritic polarity. Neurotransmitter release, for example, is usually the role of the axon. There are widespread exceptions to this rule, however, including many mammalian neuronal types that can release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. In the mouse olfactory bulb, closely related subclasses of dopaminergic interneuron differ markedly in their polarity, with one subtype lacking an axon entirely. These axon-bearing and anaxonic dopaminergic subclasses have distinct developmental profiles and sensory responses, but how their fundamental polarity differences translate to functional outputs remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide anatomical evidence for distinct neurotransmitter release strategies among these closely related dopaminergic subtypes: anaxonic cells release from their dendrites, while axon-bearing neurons release exclusively from their intermittently myelinated axon. These structural differences are linked to a clear functional distinction: anaxonic, but not axon-bearing, dopaminergic neurons are capable of self-inhibition. Our findings suggest that variations in polarity can produce striking distinctions in neuronal outputs, and that even closely related neuronal subclasses may play entirely separate roles in sensory information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96437">Postural adaptations may contribute to the unique locomotor energetics seen in hopping kangaroos</a></h4>

              
                Hopping kangaroos exhibit remarkably little change in their rate of metabolic energy expenditure with locomotor speed compared to other running animals. This phenomenon may be related to greater elastic energy savings due to increasing tendon stress; however, the mechanisms which enable the rise in stress without additional muscle work remain poorly understood. In this study, we created a three-dimensional (3D) kangaroo musculoskeletal model, integrating 3D motion capture and force plate data, to analyse the kinematics and kinetics of hopping red and grey kangaroos. Using our model, we evaluated how body mass and speed influence (i) hindlimb posture, (ii) effective mechanical advantage (EMA), (iii) the associated tendon stress in the ankle extensors, and (iv) ankle work during hopping. We found that increasing ankle dorsiflexion and metatarsophalangeal plantarflexion likely played an important role in decreasing ankle EMA by altering both the muscle and external moment arms, which subsequently increased energy absorption and peak tendon stress at the ankle. Surprisingly, kangaroo hindlimb posture changes appeared to contribute to increased tendon stress, allowing more elastic energy storage at faster speeds. These posture-mediated increases in elastic energy storage and return could be a key factor enabling kangaroos to achieve energetic benefits at faster hopping speeds, but may limit the performance of large kangaroos due to the risk of tendon rupture.

                <p>The "sign-tracking" and "goal-tracking" model of individual variation in associative learning permits the identification of rats with different cue reactivity and predisposition to addiction-like behaviors. Certainly, compared with "goal-trackers" (GTs), "sign-trackers" (STs) show more susceptibility traits such as increased cue-induced "relapse" of drugs of abuse. Different cue- and reward-evoked patterns of activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been a hallmark of the ST/GT phenotype. However, it is unknown whether differences in the intrinsic neuronal properties of NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the core and shell subregions are also a physiological correlate of these phenotypes. We performed whole-cell slice electrophysiology in outbred male rats and found that STs exhibited the lowest excitability in the NAc core, with lower number of action potentials and firing frequency as well as a blunted voltage/current relationship curve in response to hyperpolarized potentials in both the NAc core and shell. Although firing properties of shell MSNs did not differ between STs and GTs, intermediate responders that engage in both behaviors showed greater excitability compared with both STs and GTs. These findings suggest that intrinsic excitability in the NAc may contribute to individual differences in the attribution of incentive salience.</p>

                <p>Accurate electrode implantation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of rats is essential for high-quality electrophysiological and neuromodulation studies but remains technically challenging due to the small size and deep location of the STN. Traditional stereotactic methods, relying on bregma or averaged bregma-interaural-based coordinates, often result in misplacement of electrode. Here, we introduce a combined anatomical and functional approach&mdash;bregma-interaural and electrophysiology-guided technique (BITE)&mdash;designed to enhance targeting accuracy for STN electrode implantation in male Sprague Dawley rats. In this method, anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML), and dorsal-ventral (DV) coordinates are initially determined using the average of bregma and interaural references. Electrode depth (DV axis) is fine-tuned based on real-time detection of characteristic STN neuronal firing patterns. If STN featured activity is not observed on the first implantation, additional adjustments in the AP and ML axes are made, followed by electrophysiology-guided DV tuning. Using BITE, we achieved an 83% overall success rate for STN electrode implantation, with 50% of electrodes precisely located in the dorsal STN (dSTN). This represents a significant improvement compared with the bregma-based method (17%, <I>p</I> = 0.0005) and the averaged bregma-interaural-based method (40%, <I>p</I> = 0.0188). BITE offers two main advantages: (1) increased accuracy in targeting the STN and (2) improved access to the dSTN, a region of growing interest in basal ganglia research. These findings demonstrate that BITE is a reliable and effective method for precise electrode placement in the STN and may serve as a valuable tool in rat models of deep brain stimulation and basal ganglia function.</p>

<p>Symmetric and asymmetric synapses were significantly downregulated by 50% and 20%, respectively, in the aging inferior colliculus of the Alzheimer's 3xTG mouse model during the emerging disease stage (7–8 months). There was no additional significant loss from the emerging disease stage into the established disease stage. 

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Numerous studies support a mechanistic link between hearing loss and increased risks of cognitive decline and dementia. Hearing loss is widely viewed as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). During normal aging the inferior colliculus (IC), a large auditory midbrain nucleus, undergoes numerous changes to neurotransmission, and these changes contribute to the development of central gain and presbycusis. Recent reports also implicate the IC as a nucleus that undergoes processing changes during AD. We used transmission electron microscopy (EM) to examine the synaptic ultrastructure of the central IC (ICc) in 3xTG mice during presymptomatic, emerging, and established disease stages. Synapses were identified by a collection of presynaptic vesicles, a clear synaptic cleft, and a postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses had pre and postsynaptic membranes of similar thickness, whereas asymmetric synapses had postsynaptic densities were conspicuously thicker than the presynaptic densities. We also quantified the presynaptic profile areas, active zone lengths, and presynaptic mitochondria. The data demonstrate a significant loss of symmetric and asymmetric synapses in the emerging disease stage. In particular, the density of symmetric synapses in the ICc was reduced by ∼50%. As inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and neuropeptide Y are released from neurons that form symmetric synapses in the IC, the robust loss of these synapses may contribute to central gain and presbycusis during AD. Furthermore, as these synapses were lost well before the established disease stages, perhaps alterations in ICc represent an early biomarker for Alzheimer's progression.</p>

     alt="In the Caudal Pontine Reticular Nucleus, Kv1.1 Expression Is Soma Size Dependent and Invariant During Postnatal Development"/>
<p>The caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) holds neurons of different functions and sizes. Our analysis shows that soma size and shape cannot distinguish between PnC subpopulations. Kv1.1 expression is scaled with the soma size. These findings are observed in three different mammals of different brain sizes, indicating a generalization. Moreover, the Kv1.1 scaling and expression are independent of postnatal development from P8 onward, distinguishing the PnC from auditory centers such as the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The acoustic startle reaction is a rapid behavioral response to an unexpected auditory stimulus. In mammals, this reaction is based on an archaic reflex arch connecting auditory inputs via the sensor–motor interface in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) of the reticular formation with motor output. The neuronal population in the PnC is heterogeneous, containing an interspersed set of giant neurons that represent the cellular substrate of the sensorimotor interface. To probe whether the heterogeneous cell population can be divided into distinct subpopulations based on somatic morphometry or potassium channel expression, we quantitatively analyzed immunofluorescence labeling in the PnC and compared this between three mammals. In gerbil, mouse, and Etruscan shrew, soma size and roundness showed a continuum over all analyzed cells. Somatic Kv1.1 labeling intensity continuously increased with increasing soma size. Overall, no subpopulations based on somatic morphometric parameters and Kv1.1 expression were observed, suggesting that the PnC is composed of neurons displaying a continuum of soma sizes. Moreover, in mice, neurons of the MNTB but not PnC showed a postnatal developmentally regulated Kv1.1 expression, contrasting this sensorimotor interface with the sensory nuclei of the auditory brainstem.</p>

                Introduction Arterial hypertension affects around 19.4% of Peruvians over 15 years old, constituting a major public health issue. Recent evidence highlights the gut microbiome’s role in regulating blood pressure through bioactive metabolites that influence inflammation and metabolism. This study aims to characterize the gut microbiota of hypertensive adults from three Peruvian regions, contributing to the understanding of microbial influences on hypertension. Objective To analyze the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota in hypertensive and normotensive adults from different Peruvian regions, considering age, body mass index (BMI), and geographical location. Methods An observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study was conducted with 84 adults (46 hypertensive and 38 normotensive) from nine regions of Peru. Fecal samples underwent metagenomic sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 region). Alpha and beta diversity were evaluated using the Shannon index, UniFrac distances, and multivariate analyses. Microbial functional pathways were examined to identify potential metabolic differences between groups. Results The dominant phyla in all groups were Bacillota and Bacteroidota. At the genus level, Streptococcus was associated with hypertensive patients with BMI ≥25, while Alistipes appeared only in normotensive individuals with BMI <25. Alpha diversity was greater in hypertensive participants under 50 years and with BMI <25, while lower diversity was seen in normotensive adults over 50 and with BMI ≥25. Beta diversity showed partial clustering by hypertension and age, with regional overlap. Functional profiles were similar among groups, mainly involving carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, though BMI and age modulated these patterns. Conclusions Gut microbiota composition and diversity in Peruvian adults are influenced by hypertension, age, BMI, and region. Despite comparable functional profiles, environmental and nutritional factors may have a stronger impact than hypertension alone, offering insight for region-specific prevention and treatment strategies.

                <p>by Lingyu Zhang, Weiyang Shi, Ziyang Zhao, Zhichao Wang, Congying Chu, Bokai Zhao, Jiaqi Zhang, Qianhui Liu, Yueheng Lan, Tianzi Jiang</p>

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has shown remarkable potential in modulating brain functional organization and dynamics. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In this study, we employed a data-driven approach to analyze recurrent functional connectivity patterns in resting-state fMRI data and developed a parameterized feedback inhibition model to characterize excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. The findings demonstrate that LSD enhances global brain synchrony and dynamic complexity. This enhanced synchrony likely stems from LSD’s preferential stabilization of a globally synchronized yet functionally non-modular brain state - a pattern showing higher occurrence probability and acts as an “attractor” that recruits transitions from cognitive control networks. Crucially, these phenomena appear underpinned by LSD-induced convergence of excitatory/inhibitory balance across cortical hierarchies, particularly through Sensorimotor (SOM) suppression coupled with transmodal potentiation, where the Sensorimotor cortices emerge as potential regulatory hubs driving this neurochemical rebalancing. These convergent effects are consistent with the emergence of a brain state characterized by weakened sensory anchoring and enhanced cognitive flexibility, where the typical separation between concrete perception and abstract cognition becomes blurred. This neurophysiological remodeling therefore suggests a potential mechanism that could contribute to LSD’s hallucinatory effects and its therapeutic potential in mental disorders characterized by rigid thought patterns.

                <p>by Chengxu Han, Zhangdi Song, Zimu Xu, Jiaxing Chen</p>

Accurately inferring cell-cell interactions from spatial transcriptomics data remains challenging due to tissue complexity and spatial heterogeneity. Recent deep learning models have started to combine different types of cellular information, such as spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, ligand–receptor signaling, and in some cases, gene regulatory networks. However, they often treat a cell’s external interactions and internal gene regulation separately, merging them at the final step using simple concatenation or addition. This limits the model’s ability to capture how cell–cell communication and internal molecular states are connected. In this paper, we present MAGNET (Multi-view Graph Autoencoder with Cell-Gene Attention Network), a framework that reconstructs cell–cell interaction networks by building multiple biological graphs and developing a Cell-Gene attention module to link a cell’s environment with its internal gene activity in a unified representation. On benchmark datasets (seqFISH, MERFISH, STARMAP), MAGNET demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing cell-cell interaction networks, achieving an Average Precision(AP) of 0.901 on the seqFISH dataset and outperforming TENET by 0.185. The Cell-Gene Attention module is critical to MAGNET’s performance, as its removal alone caused the AP on the seqFISH dataset to drop from 0.901 to 0.521. Applied to a breast cancer dataset, MAGNET found functional heterogeneity among cancer cells, distinguishing clusters with molecular signatures for either immune evasion or autonomous tumor growth.

                <p>by Daniel H. Huson</p>

Phylogenetic trees and networks play a central role in biology, bioinformatics, and mathematical biology, and producing clear, informative visualizations of them is an important task. We present new algorithms for visualizing rooted phylogenetic networks in either a “combining” or “transfer” view, in both cladogram and phylogram style. In addition, we introduce a layout algorithm that aims to improve clarity by minimizing the total reticulate displacement of reticulate edges. To address the common issue that biological publications often omit machine-readable representations of depicted trees and networks, we also provide an image-based algorithm that assists in extracting their topology from figures. All algorithms are implemented in our new open source PhyloSketch app.

The subcellular localisation of proteins is a key determinant of their function. High-throughput analyses of these localisations can be performed using mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, which enables us to examine the localisation and relocalisation of proteins. Furthermore, complementary data sources can provide additional sources of functional or localisation information. Examples include protein annotations and other high-throughput ‘omic assays. Integrating these modalities can provide new insights as well as additional confidence in results, but existing approaches for integrative analyses of spatial proteomics datasets, such as concatenation-based methods and transfer learning approaches like KNN-TL, are limited in the types of data they can integrate and do not quantify uncertainty in their predictions. Here we propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach (wherein model parameters are inferred from <i>both</i> labeled marker proteins and unlabeled data while quantifying prediction uncertainty) to integrate spatial proteomics datasets with other data sources, to improve the inference of protein sub-cellular localisation. We demonstrate our approach outperforms other transfer-learning methods and has greater flexibility in the data it can model - including categorical annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology terms), continuous measurements (e.g., protein abundance), and temporal profiles (e.g., time-series expression data). To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we apply our method to integrate spatial proteomics data generated for the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> with time-series gene expression data generated over its cell cycle. Our findings suggest that proteins linked to invasion organelles are associated with expression programs that peak at the end of the first cell-cycle. Furthermore, this integrative analysis divides the dense granule proteins into heterogeneous populations suggestive of potentially different functions. Our method is disseminated via the mdir R package available on the lead author’s Github.

                <p>by Torbjørn V. Ness, Christof Koch, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

Electrical stimulation of nervous tissue is grounded in well-established biophysical principles, yet understanding its precise effect on neural activity remains challenging. This represents a major obstacle to both scientific and clinical applications of electrical brain stimulation.
We here show that the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism can be applied more broadly than previously acknowledged, providing a framework for elucidating the effects of electrical brain stimulation on neurons. Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation–induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/<i>r</i> falloff for nearby and 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> falloff for distant neurons.
We also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.
The reciprocity-based approach to electrical stimulation reproduces a large body of previous experimental data, and provides new insights into how ES affects neurons.

                <p>by Nilapratim Sengupta, Jennifer I. Luebke, Christina M. Weaver</p>

Action potentials (APs) propagate along axons to enable precise and rapid neuronal communication. Axon collaterals extend a given neuron’s range by distributing signals to multiple targets, but also increase its electrical demands. Myelination facilitates saltatory conduction, dramatically enhancing transmission speed and ensuring conduction fidelity over long distances. The interplay between myelin dystrophy and axonal arborization remains largely unexplored, despite their role in the impairment of AP conduction in brain circuits. Here we used cohorts of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental models of rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) layer 3 pyramidal neurons to investigate how axon collateralization, myelin dystrophy, and other structural and biophysical perturbations affect AP conduction velocity (CV). We identified core diameter and branch point location, particularly its distance from the soma, as key structural determinants of CV. Under pathological conditions, branch points emerged as sites of heightened vulnerability, where even focal myelin damage markedly impaired conduction. The efficacy of remyelination to restore CV depended on the number of segments that replaced each demyelinated region. Effective length constant and focal input resistance largely predicted CV reductions caused by structural changes. In addition to demyelination, CV was highly sensitive to variations in axoplasmic and membrane resistivities, the formation of myelin balloons, and ion channel redistribution. These findings offer a mechanistic framework for understanding AP conduction in myelinated axons with complex topologies, while also pointing to potential factors underlying individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive impairments. This work thus provides an important building block for multiscale modeling of network and behavioral effects of aging, as well as axonopathies such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.

                <p>by Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>

Shape perception is central to human vision, but its developmental origins remain unknown. Here we show that shape perception develops from three ingredients: (1) generic fitting systems, (2) embodied visual experiences, and (3) biologically plausible sensors. We first show that generic fitting models (transformers) trained on embodied visual experiences change from color-based to shape-based visual systems. We then perform <i>in silico</i> controlled-rearing experiments to determine what causes this developmental change. We find that view diversity—experiencing many views of the same object—produces shape perception. For embodied agents, view diversity comes for free: by moving through the world, agents acquire diverse temporally linked views, explaining how and why animals develop shape perception so rapidly. But when view diversity is restricted, by limiting where an agent can look or move, shape perception fails to develop. Finally, we show that retinas naturally transform images in ways that enhance shape learning, providing a biologically plausible substitute for artificial image augmentations. Together, our results support generic fitting theories of brain development and provide a template for building human-like shape perception in machines.

The ubiquitousness of hyphenated mass spectrometry techniques across life sciences has made researchers around the world aware of their analytical power. However, the analysis of multidimensional high-complexity mass spectrometry data remains virtually impossible for non-specialists. LCMSpector is a standalone graphical user interface application for straightforward analysis of targeted mass spectrometry data, distributed under the MIT license and available free of charge for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine by specifying the desired mass-to-charge ratios of the targeted compound ions and simply clicking “Process”. It allows for the processing of multiple files simultaneously, freely modifying and exporting graphs in real time, and calculating compound concentrations based on calibration standards. We show the versatility and applicability of LCMSpector to different kinds of mass spectrometry data by analyzing a series of publicly available datasets from various samples recorded on instruments from multiple vendors and by different research teams.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012352">Assessing the relative contributions of mosaic and regulatory developmental modes from single-cell trajectories</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Solène Song, Paul Villoutreix</p>

Development is a complex process driven by coordinated cell proliferation, differentiation, and spatial organization. Classically, two ways to specify cell types during development have been hypothesized: the mosaic and regulative modes. In the mosaic mode, a particular cell isolated from the rest of the embryo will still give rise to progeny with the same fate as expected in normal development, relying on lineage-inherited factors. In contrast, in the regulative mode, the fate of a cell depends on its interactions with its environment and thus relies on space-dependent factors. While both modes often co-exist, their relative contributions remain poorly quantified at single-cell resolution. We present a novel approach to measure these contributions from single-cell data from <i>C. elegans</i> development. The invariant lineage of <i>C. elegans</i> allows the integration of spatial positions, lineage relationships, and protein expression data. Using single-cell protein expression profiles as a readout of cell state, we define two quantifiable metrics: 1) a proxy for the contribution of the mosaic mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell lineage distance and the cell-cell expression distance, 2) a proxy for the contribution of the regulative mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell context distance – capturing spatial neighborhood similarity - and the cell-cell expression distance. To validate these metrics, we compared empirical results from <i>C. elegans</i> to artificial models with defined developmental rules. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of mosaic and regulative modes, with their relative contributions varying across tissues and developmental stages. For example, in skin tissue, the mosaic mode dominates in early development, while the regulative mode prevails later. Our approach offers a quantitative, unbiased, and perturbation-free method to study fundamental principles of developmental biology.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003569">Bacterial gene 5′ ends have unusual mutation rates that can mislead tests of selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sofia Radrizzani, Juan Rivas-Santisteban, Namshik Han, Laurence D. Hurst</p>

Despite early assumptions of neutrality, numerous mechanisms are now thought to cause selection on synonymous mutations, commonly supported by a low evolutionary rate at synonymous sites (<i>K</i><sub>s</sub>). This has been best evidenced in the first ~10 codons of genes in <i>E. coli,</i> where <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is less than around half that of the gene body. Diverse lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these first ~10 codons are under selection for high AT content which causes low mRNA stability that in turn enables ribosomal initiation. There remains one enigmatic discrepancy, however, namely that the low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain extends far beyond the first 10 codons. Here we ask why this is. As we see no evidence that the zone influencing protein levels has been misestimated, we consider three further hypotheses: that reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is a) owing to overlapping genes, b) reflects an extended slow translational “ramp,” and c) is mutational. We reject the first two as in both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus sp.</i> the extended low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain persists on analysis of non-overlapping genes and in <i>Bacillus</i>, where fast optimal codons tend to be A/T-ending, a fast-to-slow codon trend is seen. We fail to falsify the third hypothesis. Employing mutation accumulation data for <i>E. coli</i> we show that the 5′ end has a lower mutation rate, with the first 10 codons having a rate around half that of the gene body, this then steadily increasing following the trend seen for <i>K</i><sub>s</sub>. Compositional variation is likely to explain some of the difference, the 5′ end lacking GC-rich runs while these are most mutagenic. We conclude that even a highly reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is not always adequate to substantiate selection on synonymous mutations. This result has broad implications for inference of the causes of evolutionary rate variation.

                <p>by Ya-Wen Hsueh, Po-Min Chiang</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) requires high sensitivity, throughput, and broad compatibility across specimens. Current high-capacity methods lack sensitivity compared to low-capacity counterparts. Moreover, tissue-specific methods for collecting cells/nuclei limit unbiased comparisons across samples. Here, we propose a Unified framework by Split-Pool barcoding with optimal-efficiency PolydeoxyAdenylation for scRNA detection (USPPAR). Using short and long dsDNA substrates, low Co²⁺ concentration, while eliminating all other metal-ion components, enabled terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to efficiently polydeoxyadenylate intractable blunt and 3′ recessed dsDNA ends, which was unattainable with other systems. By benchmarking against six state-of-the-art technologies using HEK293, the efficient addition of PCR handles for cDNA amplification made USPPAR’s gene detection sensitivity comparable to high-sensitivity methods and significantly higher than existing high-cell-capacity platforms. In primary PBMCs, USPPAR enabled high-sensitivity, high-resolution scRNA-seq, and lysine conjugation improved sensitivity as an RNase inactivator. Based on nuclease reporter and mRNA protection assays, partially chelated Cu²⁺ served as a potent, non-precipitating, broad-spectrum nuclease inhibitor across various pH levels. Beyond demonstrating high sensitivity in liver tissue, an organ with low nuclease activity, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with this inhibitor enabled one-pot extraction of RNA-stable nuclei from nuclease-rich tissues, such as the pancreas. Finally, comparisons with reference datasets from the 10× platform using mouse spleen and maize tissues showed that USPPAR matched cell-type coverage while achieving higher gene-detection efficiency. With five key enzymes available and quality-controlled, USPPAR provides a unified, cost-effective, sensitive method for high-cell-capacity scRNA profiling of diverse specimens without special equipment.

                The human GBA1 gene encodes glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosylceramides. Variants in GBA1 and reduced GCase activity have been linked to Parkinson’s disease and Gaucher’s disease. Here we have characterized twenty-four GCase commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory illness mainly influencing the axial skeleton. It is a multifactorial illness in which environmental and genetic parameters contribute to its cause, one of which is interleukins, including interleukin-18 (IL-18). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relations among single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs549908 and serum levels of IL-18 in Iraqi patients with AS. Methods During the period of November 2024 and January 2025, a total of 100 individuals were enrolled in the present work, including 50 patients with AS and 50 healthy controls (HC), were obtained from Baghdad Teaching Hospital. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serum levels and rs549908 genotyping of IL-18 were estimated. Results Significantly, levels of IL-18 in serum were raised in patients with AS in compared to HC (235.7060 vs. 151.10 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Genetically, T allele frequency (69.0% vs. 49.0%, p = 0.006) and TT genotype frequency (53.1% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.004) were significantly greater in patients with AS compared to HC. Analysis under the model of dominant (TG + GG vs. TT) demonstrated significant relations among status of illness and genotype (OR = 0.29, p = 0.007). Conclusions These outcomes suggest rs549908 SNP and serum levels of IL-18, are related with raised susceptibilities to AS in the Iraqi population.

                Toxic leadership or showcasing leadership skills, which are destructive to team spirit and individuals in the workplace, have been noted to significantly influence employee turnover. The purpose of the SLR (systematic literature review) is to investigate the impact of perceived toxic leadership on employee turnover, with the primary focus on the retail industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Fifty journal articles were identified from a systematic analysis of the Science Direct database from 2018 to 2023 and have been included here to investigate toxic leadership, its influence on job satisfaction, organizational commitment, along with strategies that can be adopted to mitigate toxic leadership. This study finds that toxic leadership has a significant impact on turnover intention and organizational commitment of the employees. It affects both the mental and physical well-being of the employees, which leads to poor employee performance. Toxic leadership also negatively impacts the employer brand image and sustainability of the brand. The study outlines that to minimize the negative influence of toxic leadership, companies should provide sufficient consideration for the interests and goals of employees while also fostering emotional intelligence and ensuring that workers feel appreciated and an essential component of the company.

                Background Cooperative interactions between species play a key role in ecosystem persistence, yet most predator–prey models neglect mutualistic effects between prey species. Methodology We formulate a new three-dimensional ecological model describing one predator feeding on two cooperative prey populations, modeled by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, determine all biologically meaningful equilibrium points and establish their local and global stability using linearization, Lyapunov functions and the Routh–Hurwitz criteria. We then perform a bifurcation analysis with respect to key parameters, such as natural growth, natural mortality and predator attack and conversion rates. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in MATLAB to illustrate and complement the analytical results. Results The analysis shows that, for a realistic set of parameter values, the system admits a unique interior equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable, and no periodic dynamics are observed. Variations in the growth rates of both prey, the predator mortality rate and the attack and conversion rates can shift the stability of equilibria and generate transcritical bifurcations. The cooperative interaction between the two prey populations enlarges the parameter region that ensures coexistence and improves the long-term persistence of all species. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical predictions and visualize the trajectories converging to the stable equilibrium. Conclusions The proposed model clarifies how mutualistic interactions among prey species can stabilize predator–prey systems and enhance ecosystem sustainability. The theoretical framework and numerical results may be used as a reference for further ecological modeling that incorporates cooperation, harvesting or environmental disturbances.

                Gomez, Wu, et al. demonstrate that breast cancer promotes blunted glucocorticoid diurnal rhythms via disinhibition of PVNCRH neurons. Restoration of normal glucocorticoid rhythms via endogenous activation of the HPA axis reduces tumor progression and boosts anti-tumor immunity. This neural mechanism offers a novel target for potential anti-cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105876">IL-27 limits HSPC differentiation during infection and protects from stem cell exhaustion</a></h4>

              
                Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with trained immunity and have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice, there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs, and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27-deficient mice are predisposed toward the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection, loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98652">Dissociable memory modulation mechanisms facilitate fear amnesia at different timescales</a></h4>

              
                Memory reactivation renders consolidated memory fragile and thereby opens the window for memory updates, such as memory reconsolidation. However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory retrieval-extinction protocol prevents the return of fear expression shortly after extinction training, and this short-term effect is memory reactivation dependent (Study 1, <i>N</i>=57 adults). Furthermore, across different timescales, the memory retrieval-extinction paradigm triggers distinct types of fear amnesia in terms of cue specificity and cognitive control ability dependence, suggesting that the short-term fear amnesia might be caused by different mechanisms from the cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, <i>N</i>=79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, <i>N</i>=75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that both memory reactivation and intact prefrontal cortex function were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia after the retrieval-extinction protocol. The differences in temporal scale, cue specificity, and cognitive control ability dependence between the short- and long-term amnesia suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings suggest the potential involvement of coordinated memory modulation processes upon memory retrieval and may inform clinical approaches for treating persistent maladaptive memories.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98289">Chromatin accessibility variation provides insights into missing regulation underlying immune-mediated diseases</a></h4>

              
                Most genetic loci associated with complex traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding, suggesting that the causal variants likely have gene regulatory effects. However, only a small number of loci have been linked to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) detected currently. To better understand the potential reasons for many trait-associated loci lacking eQTL colocalization, we investigated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) explain immune-mediated disease associations that eQTLs in LCLs did not. The power to detect caQTLs was greater than that of eQTLs and was less affected by the distance from the transcription start site of the associated gene. Meta-analyzing LCL eQTL data to increase the sample size to over a thousand led to additional loci with eQTL colocalization, demonstrating that insufficient statistical power is still likely to be a factor. Moreover, further eQTL colocalization loci were uncovered by surveying eQTLs of other immune cell types. Altogether, insufficient power and context specificity of eQTLs both contribute to the ‘missing regulation’.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105452">Early changes in the properties of CA3 engram cells explored with a novel viral tool in mice</a></h4>

              
                Forming new memories after a one-time experience requires initial encoding then consolidation over time. During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labeling 24 hr following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows us to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN− neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM− neurons. This suggests that CA3 PNs recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 PNs undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task.

">Postnatal increase in MRTF-dependent transcription reduces EGFR activation and proliferation of apical but not basal NSCs</a></h4>

              
                In the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), both apical and basal NSCs undergo quiescence and proliferation. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and interactions with the extracellular matrix are key regulators of adult NSC proliferation and quiescence, respectively. Here, we show that activation of EGFR significantly declines after the first postnatal weeks in apical NSCs. This decline is accompanied by a shift in serum responsive factor (SRF)-dependent transcription in apical NSCs. Specifically, growth-promoting genes targeted by SRF and ternary complex transcription factors are downregulated, whereas those targeted by SRF and myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), including those involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling, are upregulated. Blocking of MRTFs, whose activity is regulated by the Rho/actin pathway and extracellular matrix interactions, restores EGFR activation and EGFR-dependent proliferation in adult apical NSCs. Thus, transcriptional programs regulated by extracellular cues differentially control EGFR activation and proliferation in neonatal and adult apical NSCs.

">Modeling the effects of Huntington disease on age-related genes reveals CXXC4 as an epigenetic target to restore health and excitability of Drd1-expressing striatal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Gene profile studies suggest that neurons may face premature aging in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease (HD). Cells remodel gene expression to resist molecular damage in aging, but how neurons may engage age-related genes to resist HD remains unknown. Here, we found that transcriptional-aging inversion (TAGI) in the Drd1-expressing striatal neurons (Drd1 SNs) of HD knock-in (Hdh) mice shows discrete patterns in the backdrop of a TAG-like (TAGL) signature, and that TAGI persistence as Hdh mice become strongly symptomatic may better explain disease progression compared to TAGL dynamics. We also found that genes affected by 3prime UTR accumulation in aged mouse Drd1 SNs of aged mice are more likely downregulated in aging and deregulated in Hdh mice. Mapping 3prime UTR data in aging on gene dysregulation networks in the Drd1-SNs of weakly symptomatic Hdh mice highlighted a CAG repeat-dependent network of upregulated genes with compensatory potential as suggested by enrichment in development and maintenance factors such as CTCF. This class noticeably contains Atad-5, a PCNA unloader in the DNA repair complex and a modifier of CAG expansion in the plasma of HD patients. This class also contains CXXC4 (IDAX), an epigenetic regulator and repressor of TET2 activity, for which upregulation is lost in strongly symptomatic Hdh mice. CXXC4 reduces the levels of p16INK4a, a cellular senescence marker, in human iPS cell-derived SNs and restores glutamate excitability in human HD iPS cell-derived SNs. Collectively, these data suggest that the resilience capacity of Drd1 SNs against HD involves discrete patterns of age-related genes, where early intervention based on expressing broad-spectrum genes such as CXXC4 may provide novel therapeutic strategies to restore cortico-striatal homeostasis and function.

">Deliberation is a controllable process governed by desirability and cognitive effort</a></h4>

              
                Humans spend a lifetime making decisions based on incoming sensory information and goals. Prominent theories of perceptual decision-making have described the components of deliberation process, yet they lack a unifying principle that governs how the nervous system tunes the deliberation process across multiple contexts. Desirability (reward) and effort (energy) are major determinants in governing a broad range of human and animal behaviour, such as foraging, walking, and decisions. Here we develop a theory where desirability and cognitive effort tune the control gains that govern deliberation. Several hallmark features of decision behaviour simply emerge from the model, with the deliberation process closely resembling low-dimensional neural dynamics. We also predict and provide a novel mechanistic explanation for ''choking-under-pressure'', where extremely large rewards lead to performance deficits. Our principled framework explains both behavioural and neural phenomena while providing a path to unify disparate fields.

">Alignment of Artificial Neural Networks with Human Eye Movement Patterns in Facial Expression Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become powerful tools for modeling human perception and behavior, yet it remains unclear if they resemble the sequential eye movement strategies humans employ during visual processing. Human studies demonstrate that the first two fixations play distinct roles in face processing: the initial fixation (Fix I) captures global configurational information, while the second (Fix II) targets local diagnostic details, with the two working collaboratively to support recognition. In this study, we tested if such properties emerge in ANNs trained for facial expression recognition. We fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (VGG16) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) on multiple facial expression datasets and evaluated their performance on the same images used in a human eye-tracking experiment. Human participants (N = 28) achieved a mean accuracy of 84.2%, VGG reached 82.9%, and ViT outperformed both at 90.0%. Perturbation analyses showed that both models aligned with the independent functions of Fix I and Fix II, but only ViT displayed a synergistic effect when information from both fixations was combined. Layer-wise analyses revealed stronger correspondence with Fix II than Fix I in both models, while ViT uniquely captured the statistical dependencies of fixation transitions. These findings suggest that VGG primarily reflects feedforward, detail-based processing, whereas ViT supports feedback-like integration across sequential fixations. Our results indicate that current ANNs can approximate human eye movement patterns in face processing, and highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures to model sequential strategies in human visual exploration.

">EEG-based analyses reveal different temporal processing patterns in aesthetic evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Existing studies estimate harmony values using the color harmony model, but how these values are reflected in distinct neural stages (early automatic vs. late evaluative) and shape subjective preferences remains unexamined. Methods: To fill this gap, we recorded behavioral and event-related potential data (N=30 adults, age: 29.20{+/-}2.38 years old) to examine whether the predictions of color harmony theory regarding harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations align with neural activity from a color perception paradigm. Results: Behavioral results showed that two-color combinations received higher aesthetic pleasantness ratings than three-color combinations, while the ratings for color harmony were relatively smaller than for disharmony. Univariate ERP analysis revealed that P1 amplitude for harmonious color was significantly higher than for disharmonious color, particularly when three colors were present. In contrast, the amplitude and latency of P2 were significantly impacted by the number of colors. Additionally, multivariate pattern analysis further demonstrated that neural activity reliably differentiated between harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations and two-color vs. three-color combinations during both P1 and P2 time window. Conclusions: These findings indicate that harmonious versus disharmonious color combinations subtly influenced early visual processing, while the number of colors used in the design had a stronger influence on aesthetic judgments.

">Cellular mechanisms underlying the pro-cognitive effects of serotonin 5-HT7 receptors in a mouse model of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin 5-HT7 receptors (5-HT7Rs) have emerged as promising targets for treating cognitive and affective disturbances in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, yet their cellular substrates and circuit-level mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we combined immunohistochemistry, multisite electrophysiology, and behavioral assays to investigate how 5-HT7Rs modulate hippocampal-prefrontal pathways in healthy mice and in a subchronic phencyclidine (sPCP) model of cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We found that 5-HT7Rs are abundantly expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with high co-expression in PV+ and SST+ interneurons (~80% in dHPC; 55% PV+ and 75% SST+ in mPFC). In healthy mice, systemic 5-HT7R activation with the agonist AS-19 suppressed neuronal activity and synchrony within dHPC (CA1) - mPFC (PL) pathways, reducing theta and high-gamma power, theta-gamma coupling in CA1, theta coherence, and CA1-to-PL directional connectivity, consistent with recruitment of inhibitory microcircuits. The similarity between 5-HT7R-mediated inhibition and the circuit effects we previously described for 5-HT1AR activation, together with evidence for 5-HT7R-5-HT1AR heterodimerization, suggests that these receptors act in concert to dynamically constrain hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. sPCP treatment induced persistent recognition-memory impairments, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and pathological high-frequency synchronization of hippocampal-prefrontal networks. Blockade of 5-HT7Rs with SB-269970 or the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone (but not lurasidone combined with AS-19) rescued memory performance, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and normalized aberrant high-frequency hypersynchrony, while enhancing CA1-to-PL theta signaling immediately before memory acquisition. Together, these findings indicate that 5-HT7R activation exerts potent inhibitory control over hippocampal-prefrontal pathways, likely via PV and SST interneurons, and suggest that 5-HT7R blockade constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy to restore excitation-inhibition balance and enhance neural communication within brain circuits crucial for cognition and mood regulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Neuronal silencing through depolarization block underlies odor discrimination</a></h4>

              
                The olfactory system enables animals to distinguish between attractive and aversive odor sources through the perception of odorant molecules. A fundamental challenge is maintaining stable odor identity perception despite fluctuating stimulus intensities during navigation. Using the numerically simple olfactory system of the Drosophila larva, we combined a quantitative odor discrimination assay, electrophysiology, computational modelling, and ectopic expression of odorant receptors to study the encoding of odor identity. We found that depolarization block, which silences olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at odor concentrations 3-4 log units above the detection threshold, enables odor discrimination by creating distinct patterns of OSN activity. In a minimal system with two functional OSNs, larvae discriminate between odors when depolarization block creates differential OSN silencing but fail to distinguish odors producing qualitatively similar activity patterns in both OSNs. This principle extends to odor mixtures and the fully functional olfactory system, where the high affinity of the OR42b odorant receptor for one of the test odors enables discrimination regardless of which OSN expresses OR42b. Our results indicate that depolarization block serves as an integral feature of olfactory coding alongside combinatorial OSN activation. Selective silencing of high-affinity OSNs creates distinct neural representations and enables discrimination between odors that would otherwise produce similar activity patterns. This mechanism appears evolutionarily conserved across sensory systems, from olfactory sensory neurons to photoreceptors, suggesting that selective neuronal silencing serves as a mechanism for maintaining distinct sensory representations across stimulus intensities.

">Disruption of the ganglioside-PMCA-Np nexus leads to impaired calcium homeostasis in glioblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by the disruption of multiple signaling pathways, particularly those governing calcium homeostasis. Additionally, cell membranes in GBM exhibit altered lipidomic profiles, especially complex sialoglycans gangliosides, which affect plasma membranes both structurally and functionally. In this work we show a disruption of a plasma membrane molecular triad composed of gangliosides, neuroplastin (Np), and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) in GBM, leading to a severely diminished PMCA activity. Our transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, lipidomic, and in silico analyses demonstrated downregulation of Np and PMCA isoforms at mRNA and protein levels in our GBM cohort, in agreement with broader trends observed in public datasets. Analysis of the uniquely changed GBM ganglioside profile in the context of PMCA and Np expression and PMCA activity reveals GD3 as a key molecular determinant of reduced PMCA activity in GBM samples. In contrast, GD1b, necessary for optimal PMCA function in healthy tissue, is significantly reduced in GBM. Our findings establish the gangliosides-PMCA-Np nexus as a crucial complex involved in calcium signaling in GBM, contributing to GBM etiology and progression.

">Low-Frequency Textured Gabor Flicker Enhances SSVEP Entrainment and Visual Comfort for BCI Control</a></h4>

              
                Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but the visual discomfort induced by plain luminance repetitive flickers limits their usability in mono- and especially multi-target settings due to strong peripheral distraction. Textured flicker composed of small Gabor patches has recently been proposed as a more comfortable alternative: in slow, aperiodic paradigms, these stimuli are almost invisible in the periphery yet elicit stronger visual evoked responses. However, their suitability for strictly frequency-defined SSVEP paradigms, and their frequency-dependent impact on neural entrainment and BCI performance, remain unclear. Here, we combined a systematic frequency sweep (3-18 Hz) followed by a five-class SSVEP BCI to directly compare subtly textured Gabor-based flicker against classical luminance flicker. In Session 1 (N = 24), we measured SSVEP signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), inter-trial coherence (ITC), and subjective comfort for 13 stimulation frequencies (3-12 Hz in 1 Hz steps, then 14, 16, 18 Hz). Gabor-based textures yielded significantly higher SNR and ITC than plain flicker in the 3-9 Hz range, whereas plain flicker produced stronger and more phase-consistent responses at 12-18 Hz, revealing a robust crossover in entrainment. Across almost all frequencies, Gabor stimuli were also rated as more comfortable. Based on these data, we defined a low-frequency Gabor-optimized band (5-7 Hz) and a higher plain-optimized band (14-16 Hz). In Session 2 (N = 18), we used these bands in a five-class offline BCI with an 8-channel semi-dry EEG system and TRCA-based decoding. Classification accuracy was highest when each stimulus type was used in its own optimal band (Gabor: 95.7% at 5-7 Hz; plain: 98.1% at 14-16 Hz) and dropped markedly when stimulus type and band were mismatched. Across both bands, Gabor stimuli were consistently rated as more comfortable and less peripherally distracting than plain flicker. Together, these results establish textured Gabor flicker as a comfortable and effective alternative to luminance flicker for low-frequency SSVEP paradigms, revealing complementary frequency regimes for texture- and luminance-driven entrainment. This frequency-aware design space advances both perceptual neuroscience and the development of user-centered, multi-target SSVEP BCIs.

">TET2-dependent differential 5hmC deposition balances adult neural stem cell activation and differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes are key regulators of active DNA demethylation, converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape and cellular identity. While their roles have been characterized in pluripotent and some multipotent stem cells, their function in adult neural stem cells (NSCs) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that TET2 is critical for the maintenance and differentiation of adult NSCs, orchestrating locus-specific 5hmC deposition across promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers. Importantly, 5hmC remodeling segregates into two functionally distinct programs: promoter-associated gains of 5hmC are strongly TET2-dependent and drive transcription of genes controlling neural differentiation and calcium signaling, whereas gene body- and enhancer-associated 5hmC gains partially depend on TET2 and sustain proliferative and metabolic pathways, thereby maintaining stemness. Loss of TET2 disrupts these 5hmC programs, downregulates key differentiation- and calcium-related genes, and impairs the normal differentiation-associated increase in intracellular calcium, revealing a functional consequence of altered epigenetic regulation. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for TET2 in coordinating complementary epigenetic and transcriptional programs that balance stemness and differentiation in adult NSCs.

">The effect of sex on sleep EEG in typical and altered neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) patterns exhibit complex variations influenced by multiple factors, including sex. While sex effects in sleep neurophysiology are relatively well described in adults, evidence in pediatric populations is more limited, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we analyzed a large pediatric clinical dataset to examine sex differences in whole-night sleep EEG among children without NDDs (N=1523, 2.5-17.5 years) and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N=196), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N=523), and intellectual disabilities (IntDis, N=167). Medical record analysis revealed limited sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. Using the open-source package Luna, we extracted a broad range of sleep EEG features (435 in total) and found that 25% of all tested metrics showed significant sex differences in the non-NDD sample with the majority replicated in an independent population-based pediatric cohort. Non-NDD boys exhibited more fragmented sleep compared to girls, but this pattern was not observed among children with NDDs. In contrast, fast spindle density was lower in boys regardless of NDD diagnosis, which may contribute to males' increased susceptibility to developing NDDs. No sex differences were observed in EEG-based brain age predictions. Several sleep EEG metrics showed nominal group-by-sex interactions with ASD and ADHD girls displaying more pronounced alterations, pointing to a varying degree of sleep disturbance. Overall, our findings demonstrate that many sleep EEG features exhibit significant sex differences during childhood, but these differences may be distinct in NDD populations. The sex-specific sleep alterations in NDDs underscore the importance of including both sexes in future research.

">EEG Dynamics of Movement Preparation and Error Processing Distinguish Motor Adaptation From De Novo Learning</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has distinguished behavioral mechanisms between motor adaptation and de novo learning. However, electroencephalography (EEG) markers dissociating them remain unclear. Here, participants (N = 32, 13 female) performed center-out reaching under a 30{degrees} fixed rotation (adaptation), mirror reversal (de novo learning), or random rotation (errors without learning), while we recorded EEG during movement preparation and post-movement feedback. We explored how perturbation type, training phase, and error magnitude shaped neural dynamics in both temporal and frequency domains. During preparation, the readiness potential (RP) showed opposite training-related modulation in the fixed and random rotations, suggesting increased reliance on updated internal models for adaptation. Mirror reversal training showed no RP change, likely reflecting reliance on effortful, explicit learning. Interestingly, we found that Lateralized Readiness Potentials (LRPs) reflected planned movement direction rather than effector-specific preparation. In the frequency domain, beta attenuation for large errors and alpha synchronization for small errors were more pronounced in the fixed rotation than in the mirror reversal, suggesting greater error-sensitivity during adaptation. During post-movement feedback, P3 amplitude decreased from early to late learning in the fixed and random rotations but remained stable in the mirror reversal, highlighting differences in cognitive demands across perturbations. A sustained late positivity emerged following small errors across perturbations, potentially indexing implicit learning. Random rotations also elicited distinct frontal and central beta modulation, likely reflecting disengagement due to task unpredictability. Together, we show that preparatory and feedback-related EEG signatures differ across perturbation types, revealing distinct neural mechanisms underlying motor adaptation and de novo learning.

">Cocaine sensitization and accumbens shell plasticity depend on biological sex and gonadal hormones in C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                Biological sex as a defining variable in drug sensitivity remains poorly understood. Here, we combine behavioral and electrophysiological analyses to examine the influence of sex and gonadal hormones on cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) plasticity in the prominent C57BL/6J mouse strain. Males exhibited greater cocaine-evoked locomotor activity than females; castration attenuated responses, whereas ovariectomy enhanced them. This behavioral phenotype is opposite to what occurs in rats. A 10-14 day abstinence period abolished the sex difference in intact animals, and gonadectomy reduced cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity. Recordings from 309 medium spiny neurons revealed sex-dependent NAcSh plasticity. In males, cocaine decreased neuronal excitability, while in females it induced estrous cycle-dependent plasticity characterized by reduced excitability during diestrus relative to estrus. These effects were driven by cocaine-induced modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels. Cocaine potentiated glutamatergic strength in males but elicited estrous cycle-dependent depotentiation in females. These adaptations in excitability and glutamatergic strength were abolished by gonadectomy, and paralleled diminished behavioral plasticity during abstinence. These data illustrate that biological sex and hormonal milieu critically shape cocaine-induced plasticity, offering a more nuanced framework than the traditional notion of heightened female sensitivity to drugs of abuse.

">An algorithm underlying directional hearing in fish</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other land vertebrates localize sound by comparing the signals in each ear. Even though these differences are virtually absent underwater, fish are still able to sense sound direction. In 1975, Arie Schuijf proposed that this ability could arise from a comparison of the particle motion phase and the pressure phase of sound, a prediction which was recently confirmed experimentally for near-field sounds. In natural environments, however, sounds arrive from variable distances, altering the motion-pressure phase relationship. Thus, directional hearing and distance hearing are potentially at conflict. There is currently neither a model nor experimental data for how fish deal with this complexity. Here, we systematically introduce phase differences to the particle motion and pressure components of sound pulses to quantify the directional tuning of startle responses in Danionella cerebrum. We find that the fish's directed startle behavior is both frequency and phase dependent, and introduce a new model that quantitatively predicts the sensorimotor transformation across all observed stimuli. This framework likely extends to other otophysan fishes with evolutionarily conserved hearing apparatus, representing ~15% of all vertebrate species.

">Octopamine instructs head direction plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Many plasticity rules rely on adjusting the strength of synapses between pairs of cells based on their coincident activity. We uncovered a new mechanism for coincidence detection in the Drosophila head direction network. To maintain an accurate sense of direction, head direction neurons that signal orientation during navigation must learn to anchor to relevant external sensory cues in novel environments. Yet the synaptic mechanism for this form of unsupervised learning is unknown in any organism. In Drosophila, GABAergic visual inputs converge onto head direction neurons, and these inhibitory synapses change strength with experience to learn the relationship between visual landmarks and head direction. However, how coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity is detected across this inhibitory synapse is not understood. We discovered that neurons which release the monoamine octopamine close a feedback loop that conveys postsynaptic head direction activity onto presynaptic terminals of visual inputs. This octopamine pathway is required for anchoring the head direction network to visual cues. Furthermore, pairing structured activation of octopamine neurons with a visual cue is sufficient to drive rapid plasticity, even without postsynaptic head direction cell activity. Previous work has extensively characterized coincidence detection mechanisms at excitatory synapses; our work defines a novel mechanism for coincidence detection at an inhibitory synapse, in which postsynaptic activity is relayed via a neuromodulatory neuron onto presynaptic terminals.

">Axonal growth of cortical neurons does not require paxillin</a></h4>

              
                Axon growth is an essential cellular process during neural development, and its dysregulation contributes to numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. During axon growth, extracellular signals direct neurons to extend projections that connect with their synaptic targets. Paxillin is a key member of adhesion sites that control motility by linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Paxillin also binds to the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin. However, little is known about the role of adhesion proteins in neurons. Here, we use conditional paxillin knockout mice to investigate how loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons affects developing neuron morphology. Surprisingly, loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons caused no change in axon length or soma area between control (PxnF/F) and conditional paxillin knockout (PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre) mice at basal conditions. Following brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, the loss of paxillin resulted in no change in soma area or axonal {beta}-tubulin levels, but did result in a significant increase in axon length, as compared to control. Finally, the corpus callosum size was not significantly different between PxnF/F and PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre animals. In summary, these data suggest that paxillin is not required for axonal growth during neural development.

">Experiences are encoded by brainwide reprogramming of synaptome architecture</a></h4>

              
                Synaptome architecture describes the spatiotemporal distribution of highly diverse excitatory synapses throughout the brain. Whether and how this architecture is impacted by experience is key to understanding its role in learning and memory. We found that environmental enrichment and monocular visual deprivation drive large-scale, type- and subtype-specific reorganisation of excitatory synapses in more than one hundred brain regions. Each experience modifies distinct subsets of synapses, with patterns aligned with protein turnover rates and connectome architecture. These reorganisations occur during development and adulthood, revealing a conserved mechanism of synaptome plasticity across the lifespan. Our findings support a population-selection model in which experience drives adaptation by selectively modifying synapse varieties, generating a distributed trace of past experiences. Our results also point to synaptome architecture as a shared framework integrating experience, lifespan changes, sleep, genetic variation and disease.

">Thalamic Interictal Epileptic and Non-Epileptic Events during NREM Sleep in Patients with Focal Epilepsy: a Stereo-EEG Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Thalamic recordings are increasingly incorporated into stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) evaluations of drug-resistant focal epilepsy to guide neuromodulation targeting. Human thalamic electrophysiology, however, is poorly defined, limiting the distinction between pathological and physiological activity. Here, we characterized interictal epileptic and non-epileptic events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep across multiple thalamic nuclei and examined their relationship to seizure outcomes. Methods: We analyzed NREM sleep SEEG recordings from 64 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Electrodes sampled four thalamic nuclei: centromedian (CM), pulvinar (Pu), ventral lateral (VL), and ventral posterolateral (VPL). Patients were classified into three outcome groups: favorable, unfavorable, and surgically non-remediable. Rates of thalamic spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spike-fast activity, and sleep spindles were analyzed and compared across nuclei and outcomes. Findings: Recordings of the thalamus revealed both pathological and physiological interictal events. Interictal epileptic events were infrequent. Only ~0.2% of seizure-onset zone spikes propagated to the thalamus. Thalamic spike-fast activity was indicative of unfavorable outcomes (CM: p = 0.047, d = 0.46) or surgically non-remediable epilepsy (VL: p = 0.002, d = 0.84). In contrast, thalamic sleep spindles were ubiquitous but reduced in surgically non-remediable patients (CM: p = 0.031, d = -0.58; VL: p = 0.005, d = -0.79). Finally, unique thalamic SEEG patterns were identified, including spikes concomitant with spindles, isolated spikes, and physiological fast ripples. Interpretation: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of thalamic interictal events during NREM sleep, enriching our understanding of thalamic pathophysiology and highlighting the value of thalamic recordings in pre-surgery evaluation.

">δ2-Protocadherins organize parallel indirect basal ganglia circuits</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) contain multiple parallel neural circuits, each of which may control different behaviors. However, how the distinct parallel BG circuits are molecularly organized is not known. Here we show that two {delta}2-protocadherins (PCDHs), PCDH17 and PCDH10, which are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, establish and define two distinct indirect BG circuits that regulate different behaviors. PCDH17 and PCDH10 are expressed in a complementary expression pattern in the BG, anatomically defining two parallel indirect BG connections. Indirect pathway-specific Pcdh17 and Pcdh10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show impaired establishment of the indirect BG circuits in a region-preferential manner. Finally, the Pcdh17-cKO mice show defects in task learning, while the Pcdh10-cKO mice show defects in motor/sensory habituation. These results identify PCDH17 and PCDH10 as the molecular organizers for two distinct indirect BG circuits regulating different behaviors and reveal the molecular mechanisms for organizing parallel BG circuits.

Here, we examined neural mechanisms involved in suppressing visual perceptual learning (VPL), a type of visual skill learning, for a repeatedly exposed task-irrelevant coherent motion direction. The direction was either perceptually salient (suprathreshold for coherent motion detection) or weak (near detection threshold). Excitatory and inhibitory processing of the task-irrelevant direction during exposure was measured in early visual areas (V1 and V2) in the occipital lobes with functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). The results showed that, compared to near threshold exposure, VPL for the coherent motion direction was suppressed in suprathreshold exposure. Excitatory processing in early visual areas, as reflected in the concentration of glutamate, was reduced during suprathreshold compared to near threshold exposure. No modulation of inhibitory processing, as reflected in the concentration of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was found. These results suggest that a gating mechanism operates within early visual areas that acts to suppress VPL for salient task-irrelevant signals by reducing excitatory processing.</span>

">A bifunctional optical reporter for tracking estrogen response dynamics in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Estrogens are inherently dynamic signaling molecules whose fluctuations induce profound shifts in physiology and behavior. However, methods for tracking the dynamics of estrogen action in vivo are limited and not tissue-specific, making it difficult to directly relate dynamics to ongoing physiological, behavioral, and neural changes. Traditionally, estrogen sensitive cells have been identified by metrics such as receptor expression or radioactive ligand binding, but these measures do not capture the dynamic nature of hormone response. In addition, current methods for assessing the dynamics of estrogens in an individual, including microdialysis and vaginal cytology, lack temporal and spatial resolution.To address this need we developed a bifunctional reporter called neuro-seeER (neuronal see Estrogen Response) that can be used to track changes in exogenous and endogenous estrogen dynamics in vitro and in vivo, including longitudinally in behaving animals. We confirmed that the fluorescent response requires estrogen receptor expression, is specific to activation with estradiol, and is consistent with the timescale of transcriptional induction. Neuro-seeER expression in the hypothalamus of Esr1-Cre mice revealed dynamic labeling of estrogen-responsive cells following treatment with exogenous estradiol, and fluorescence-aided cell sorting followed by RNA-sequencing confirmed that high neuro-seeER response is associated with enriched expression of genes associated with endogenous estrogen responses. Using a novel "snapshot" photometry method to track the dynamics longitudinally in vivo, we demonstrate that we can robustly detect exogenous estrogen response across multiple hypothalamic sites simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that this tool is uniquely suited to capturing endogenous estrogen response dynamics in vivo across the long timescale of the estrous cycle, revealing individual differences in neural estrogen dynamics. Together, these findings reveal unexpected cellular and temporal heterogeneity of the transcriptional response and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking the dynamics of hormonal response alongside additional neural, cell signaling, or behavioral measures.

                Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are known for sculpting excitatory neural circuits via dynamic processes. However, their role in modulating inhibitory synaptic connections in adulthood remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an underappreciated microglia subpopulation, satellite microglia with physical soma-soma contact with neurons, that reshape inhibitory circuit connectivity and gate neuronal activity by shielding inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse brain. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in adult mice, we observed in real time that satellite microglia associations displaced perisomatic inhibitory synapses whereas their dissociation permitted inhibitory synaptogenesis. Redistribution of satellite microglia reorganized inhibitory connectivity, altered local neural networks and changed behaviors. These findings establish satellite microglia as key architects of inhibitory circuitry and suggest their broader role in neural plasticity in health and disease.

">Differential Regulation of APOE4-Mediated Astrocytic Lipid Metabolism by BMP Signaling Exacerbates Alzheimers Disease Pathologies in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The two greatest risk factors for Alzheimers Disease (AD) are aging and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism, yet how these factors interact remain unclear. In this study, we investigate how bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which increases with age, contributes to APOE4-induced lipid metabolic dysfunctions using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and cocultured neurons. Surprisingly, BMP signaling differentially altered lipid droplet formation, cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, and fatty acid-oxidation in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, and increased secretion of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Furthermore, neurons cocultured with BMP4-treated APOE4 astrocytes showed altered transcriptomic profiles based on scRNA-seq as well as increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau). oxLDL treatment similarly increased p-tau and reduced neuronal survival. Conversely, lipid uptake inhibition in neurons rescued the BMP4/APOE4 astrocyte-induced neuronal phenotype. These data demonstrate key interactions between APOE4 and aging-associated molecular signaling in AD pathogenesis and establish a causal linkage between astrocytic lipid metabolism and neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.

">Automatic binding of basic sensory features requires consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Conscious awareness requires establishing coherent percepts. Yet, whether consciousness is necessary for initiating the integration of basic sensory features remains unclear. Competing theories implicate distinct functional regimes of consciousness in the process of feature binding and creating conscious percepts. We used a novel multi-feature oddball paradigm with intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings in awake and anesthetized states to investigate the functional boundary of consciousness. In the awake state, the auditory attributes of loudness and tone, as well as the binding of the two features, were automatically encoded without attention to the stimuli in a functionally localized sensory cortical network. In the anesthetized state, the cortical registration of single attributes was preserved, whereas the binding was abolished. Moreover, anesthesia mostly influenced later cortical processes after stimuli offset. These results reveal the borderline of exertion of consciousness between the encoding and manipulation of basic sensory features in local cortical circuits: the functional boundary of consciousness constrains the feedforward binding and recurrent process directly at local rather than global level computations.

">Microglia and its P2RY12 Receptors Regulate Seizure Severity</a></h4>

              
                Microglia have emerged as possible regulators of seizures with previous approaches employed being insufficiently selective of microglial-specific contributions. To more definitely determine microglial roles in seizure severity, we used the recently developed genetic microglial-deficient Csf1r{Delta}FIRE/{Delta}FIRE (FIRE KO) mouse model. In this model, mice lack microglia but retain brain border associated macrophages (BAMs). Using two experimental seizure paradigms with either a chemoconvulsant or electrical stimulation, we confirm that a microglial deficiency exacerbates seizures, reduces survival and facilitates the likelihood of developing spontaneous recurrent seizures, indicating that microglia constrain seizure activity across different seizure paradigms. To gain insights into molecular regulators of seizure severity under microglial regulation, we examined P2RY12 contributions and demonstrate that a loss of microglial P2RY12 increased seizure severity in both global and microglial-specific knockout mice indicating that microglia suppress seizure severity in chemoconvulsive models through P2RY12 signaling. During seizures, P2RY12-deficient microglia displayed altered process complexity, accompanied by increased neuronal activation and reduced inhibitory tone. These results link impaired microglial responses to heightened seizure susceptibility and network excitability. Together, our findings establish microglia as protective regulators of seizure activity and identify P2RY12 signaling as a critical mediator of microglia protective actions.

">Influenza A infection accelerates disease-associated microglia formation during physiological aging</a></h4>

              
                Severe pneumonia is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, particularly in the elderly. Changes in microglia, the most abundant immune cell population in the brain, are also associated with cognitive decline and dementia, including the emergence of a transcriptional cell state referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). We sought to test the hypothesis that non-neuroinvasive influenza A virus (IAV) pneumonia results in transcriptional responses in brain microglia that drive premature expansion of DAM. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, and spatial transcriptomics, we profiled neuroimmune populations in young, middle-aged, and old male mice during IAV infection and recovery. We observed an increased abundance of DAM, interferon-responsive microglia (IRM), CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in white matter regions beginning in middle age and persisting in old animals, irrespective of IAV infection. DAM exhibited a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis with disrupted TCA cycling, citrulline depletion, and an elevated itaconate/-ketoglutarate ratio. Spatial transcriptomic profiling of the human middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in normal agers, SuperAgers, and patients with dementia revealed an analogous accumulation of DAM and CD8+ T cells in white matter. IAV pneumonia induced a transient immunosenescent-like response in microglia, marked by glucocorticoid-responsive gene expression and Ccnd3 upregulation. In response to IAV pneumonia, DAM expanded in middle-aged mice, whereas old mice were elevated at baseline and were largely unaffected by IAV infection. The age-related expansion of DAM was unaffected by pharmacological depletion and repopulation of microglia with a CSF1R antagonist or genetic gain or loss of function of the phagocytic receptor MERTK, suggesting the DAM phenotype is driven by the CNS microenvironment, rather than cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that IAV pneumonia induces an acute immunosenescence response in microglia and accelerates the age-dependent expansion of DAM in white matter.

">Degraded sensory coding in a mouse model of Scn2a-related disorder and its rescue by CRISPRa gene activation</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN2A, a sodium channel gene expressed in cortical pyramidal (PYR) cells, lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, and cortical sensory dysfunction. In Scn2a+/- mice, PYR dendritic excitability and synapses are impaired, but cortical information processing deficits are unknown. In the whisker somatosensory cortex, we found strongly degraded somatotopic tuning of PYR cells, profoundly blurred whisker maps, and impaired population coding, despite normal overall firing rates. This constitutes a robust biomarker for Scn2a-related cortical dysfunction. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were also unexpectedly hypofunctional. We tested for rescue of coding deficits in post-critical period, young adult mice by viral delivery of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) reagents that upregulate Scn2a. CRISPRa treatment normalized cortical sensory representations at the single-unit and map levels. This suggests that therapy to increase Scn2a expression may be effective in normalizing cortical function in Scn2a loss-of-function disorder, even in older children or adults.

">A distinct set of brain areas process prosody--the melody of speech</a></h4>

              
                Human speech carries information beyond the words themselves: pitch, loudness, duration, and pauses--jointly referred to as 'prosody'--emphasize critical words, help group words into phrases, and convey emotional and other socially-relevant information. Using a novel fMRI paradigm, we identify a set of prosody-responsive brain areas and then richly characterize them across 8 experiments (25 experimental conditions; n=51 participants). These areas--located on the lateral temporal surface bilaterally and in the frontal lobe--respond to the presence of prosody in both meaningful and meaningless speech, and are distinct from nearby temporal pitch- and speech-perception areas and from frontal areas sensitive to general cognitive and attentional demands. They are also dissociable from--but show partial overlap with--the language areas and with the area that processes dynamic facial expressions. Thus, prosodic information is processed by a distinct set of brain areas, which may help integrate linguistic meanings with non-verbal communicative signals.

">Cell-type Specific Extracellular Vesicles in Mouse Brain: Proteomic Signatures Highlight Astrocytic GlialCAM Network and GPCR Enrichment</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) and are emerging as biomarkers of brain health and disease. However, the molecular composition of cell type-specific brain EVs, particularly astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs), remains poorly defined. Methods: We performed comparative proteomic analysis of neuronal (NDEVs), microglial (MDEVs), and astrocytic (ADEVs) from mouse brain using magnetic immunocapture and LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling. Results: Each EV subtype displayed distinct molecular fingerprints. NDEVs were enriched in synaptic proteins and neurogenesis-related proteins (e.g., APP and BDNF), whereas MDEVs contained immune and phagocytic markers (e.g., CX3CR1). Strikingly, the ADEV proteome closely mirrored the recently characterized GlialCAM interactome from leukodystrophy research, encompassing GlialCAM/MLC1 and associated partners involved in ion and water homeostasis (EAAT1/2, AQP4, GJA1), together with GPCRs such as GPRC5B. This overlap suggests that ADEVs encapsulate a molecular scaffold characteristic of astrocytic endfeet, potentially extending their signaling functions to the extracellular space. Conclusion: Our study provides a detailed comparative proteomic characterization of brain cell-type specific EVs, revealing that ADEVs contain the GlialCAM/MLC1 network and GPCRs. These findings position ADEVs as promising candidates for EV-based biomarkers and mechanistic studies in CNS disorders.

">Visual working memory representations of naturalistic images in early visual cortex are not sensory-like</a></h4>

              
                For a long time, working memory was considered to reflect sustained activity in prefrontal and parietal areas. This has been challenged by the "sensory recruitment model" according to which sensory areas are involved in maintaining working memory representations. The main support for this comes from the finding that working memory contents can be decoded from early sensory areas during memory delay periods. However, the availability of stimulus-related information in sensory regions does not reveal whether this information is encoded in a sensory format, i.e. in the same way as sensory stimuli. Alternatively, working memory contents could be encoded in independent formats or even potentially undergo dynamic changes throughout the delay. Here, we test this question directly by requiring participants to briefly memorise naturalistic object-scenes. We directly compared the way early visual regions encoded the contents during perception and working memory maintenance. As in previous studies, we found robust stimulus-related information in early visual cortex throughout the delay. However, despite continuously robust information, the encoding of memory contents in the later delay period did not occur in the same format as during pure perception. Thus, despite the fact that sensory areas have working-memory-related information, the format of this information is not strictly sensory-like throughout the delay.

">Auditory representations of words during silent visual reading</a></h4>

              
                Silent visual reading is accompanied by the phenomenological experience of an inner voice. However, the temporal dynamics and functional role of the underlying neural representations remain unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data while humans read naturalistic narratives, and applied computational modelling to isolate time-resolved auditory from visual and semantic representations. Our results revealed robust auditory representations during silent reading that were not explained by visual or semantic features, emerging already before word onset. These auditory representations mimicked the sequence of sounds of the corresponding words in a fine-grained manner, revealing a candidate basis for the phenomenological experience of hearing an inner voice while reading. Finally, we show that auditory word representations exhibit a key signature of predictive processing: they are stronger for unexpected than expected words. More specifically, early auditory features contribute to predictions before word onset, whereas later features only contribute after word onset, suggesting distinct prediction stages. Together our results reveal the temporal dynamics and functional role of auditory representations in silent reading.

                Background Chronic diseases impose a substantial global health burden, with outcomes frequently compromised by suboptimal long-term patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens. Gamification, the application of game-design principles in non-game contexts, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance patient motivation and self-management. Methods This paper introduces a comprehensive, theory-driven gamification framework designed for integration within a Virtual Health Coach (VHC) system for chronic disease management. Based on Self-Determination Theory, Behavioural Economics, and the Health Belief Model, the framework synthesises five core components: adaptive challenges tailored to individual progress, interactive educational modules, structured reward incentives, social support features, and seamless integration with wearable devices for real-time feedback. Results Recognising that implementation is impeded by challenges such as the digital divide, data privacy concerns, and the risk of user fatigue, this work also proposes a robust analytics framework to guide evaluation and continuous refinement. This evaluation model employs a mixed-methods approach, combining metrics for user engagement, clinical health outcomes, and patient-reported satisfaction with A/B testing and machine learning for predictive analytics. Conclusions The proposed gamified VHC architecture offers a blueprint for developing adaptive, personalised, and sustainable digital health interventions that can enhance patient adherence and improve outcomes, thereby advancing the paradigm of patient-centred chronic care.

<p>Major depressive disorder is a significant health concern among adolescents due to its link to suicide and lifetime impairments. Current treatments yield limited success, but real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (RT-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) is a promising intervention. We tested the effects of RT-fMRI neurofeedback on the modulation of neural circuitry underlying self-referential processing and emotion regulation in youth trying to up-regulate the amygdala-hippocampus (AMYHIPP) complex. We examined amygdala functional connectivity during a self-other face recognition task before and after RT-fMRI NF from the AMYHIPP complex. (1) Depressed youth showed higher bilateral amygdala to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior temporal and frontal gyri connectivity compared to controls, who showed lower connectivity before NF. Yet after NF, this pattern reversed, with depressed youth showing lower bilateral amygdala connectivity than controls. (2) Depressed youth showed <i>increased right</i> amygdala-cuneus connectivity while controls showed <i>increased left</i> amygdala-cuneus connectivity during self-other face recognition. (3) Lower right amygdala-cuneus connectivity was linked to improved rumination. Higher left amygdala-cuneus connectivity was linked to improved depression. (4) Shifts of less right versus left amygdala to superior middle temporal gyri connectivity after neurofeedback, and of more right versus left amygdala to middle frontal gyrus after NF, were linked to higher AMYHIPP engagement during training. This is suggestive of NF training effects upon implicit versus explicit emotion circuits. Caution is necessary regarding the meaning of symptoms to circuits associations and putative mechanisms of neurofeedback training given the lack of a placebo group.</p>

                Han et al. demonstrate that binding of eIF3 to distinct sites in mRNA 5′ UTRs mediates chaperone recruitment to translating 80S ribosomes. This recruitment is essential for the correct folding of nascent ER membrane proteins, indicating that instructions for ER membrane protein folding are hardwired in the genome.

                <p>RNA localization to neuronal axons and dendrites provides spatiotemporal control over gene expression to support synapse function. Neuronal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) localize as ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), commonly known as RNA granules, the composition of which influences when and where proteins are made. High-throughput sequencing has revealed thousands of mRNAs that localize to the hippocampal neuropil. Whether these mRNAs are spatially organized into common RNA granules or distributed as independent mRNAs for proper delivery to synapses is debated. Here, using highly multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (HiPlex smFISH) and colocalization analyses, we investigate the subcellular spatial distribution of 15 synaptic neuropil localized mRNAs in the male and female rodent hippocampus. We observed that these mRNAs are present in the neuropil as heterogeneously sized fluorescent puncta with spatial colocalization patterns that generally scale by neuropil mRNA abundance. Indeed, differentially expressed mRNAs across cell types displayed colocalization patterns that scaled by abundance, as did simulations that reproduce cell-specific differences in abundance. Thus, the probability of these mRNAs colocalizing in the neuropil is best explained by stochastic interactions based on abundance, which places constraints on the mechanisms mediating efficient transport to synapses.</p>

                The integration of digital technology in vocational education has redefined instructional delivery and learner engagement. However, the extent to which technology enhances learning depends largely on the quality of teacher–student interaction. This study investigates the mediating role of Teacher–Student Interaction (TSI) in the relationship between the Technology-Enhanced Learning Environment (TEL) and Learning Engagement (LE). Drawing on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) frameworks, this research tested a structural model to explain how interaction bridges technological and pedagogical processes in vocational learning contexts. A total of 362 valid responses were collected from vocational students across Indonesia using a stratified sampling approach. The data were analyzed through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using SmartPLS 4 with 5,000 bootstrap samples. The results demonstrated that TEL positively influenced TSI (β = 0.71, p < .001) and LE (β = 0.39, p < .01). Moreover, TSI significantly predicted LE (β = 0.53, p < .001). The indirect pathway from TEL to LE through TSI was also significant (β = 0.37, p < .001), indicating partial mediation with a Variance Accounted for (VAF) of 48.7%. The model achieved an excellent fit (χ2/df = 2.31, CFI = 0.953, TLI = 0.947, SRMR = 0.046, RMSEA = 0.048) and explained 55% of the variance in TSI and 68% in LE. These findings affirm that technology integration enhances learning engagement primarily when mediated by active teacher–student interaction. The study underscores that digital transformation in vocational education must emphasize pedagogical presence and communicative interaction to sustain engagement, particularly in remote and under-resourced (3T) regions.

Computational modeling of peripheral nerve fibers is a key tool for designing improved neuromodulation therapies. The NEURON software is commonly used to create biophysical simulations of nerve fibers, often in the outdated HOC language. Whether written in HOC or Python, implementing fiber simulations involves a steep learning curve and requires a large amount of standard, boilerplate code that is typically written anew for each project. There is a need for a code package that standardizes and simplifies the creation of model fibers, the execution of simulations of electrical stimulation, and the analysis of the resulting data. We created PyFibers, a NEURON-Python package that provides tools for accomplishing all these tasks and supports the development of new fiber models and stimulation protocols. PyFibers includes 11 fiber models from prior publications under a shared framework, and we validated each model’s implementation in PyFibers against the original results. Our open-source tool simplifies and standardizes computational modeling of peripheral nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation, providing a platform for the development of novel therapies using electrical stimulation, block, and recording.

                <p>by Yuqing Hou, Oranti Ahmed Omi, Michael W. Stuck, Xi Cheng, Bethany Walker, Ying-Wai Lam, Anna M. Schmoker, Son N. Nguyen, Maria Paz Gonzalez-Perez, Bryan A. Ballif, Karl F. Lechtreck, George B. Witman, Gregory J. Pazour</p>

Variants in the protein kinase CDKL5 cause CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), a severe neurodevelopmental condition characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The <i>Chlamydomonas</i> homolog of CDKL5, LF5, is a flagellar protein whose loss leads to elongated flagella. Here, we combine live-cell imaging, immunofluorescence, and biochemical approaches including mass spectrometry to define how CDKL5 activity is regulated and how its loss alters ciliary function. We find that <i>Chlamydomonas</i> CDKL5 is activated by LF2, a cyclin-dependent kinase, through phosphorylation of its activation loop. This activation controls CDKL5 localization in steady-state cilia, down-regulates its IFT-mediated transport as flagella reach steady-state, controls ciliary abundance of IFT proteins, and controls phosphorylation of the tubulin-binding domain of IFT74, thereby influencing flagellar length. Mouse Cdkl5 shows similar properties: it localizes within cilia, its loss leads to ciliary elongation, and its localization depends on both its kinase activity and Cdk20, the mammalian ortholog of LF2. These results extend our understanding of ciliary length control, challenge the prevailing model that CDKL5 is activated by autophosphorylation, and suggest that CDD pathogenesis arises, at least in part, from disruption of this conserved ciliary regulatory pathway.

                <p>by Ben Vezina, Helena B. Cooper, Christopher K. Barlow, Martin Rethoret-Pasty, Sylvain Brisse, Jonathan M. Monk, Kathryn E. Holt, Kelly L. Wyres</p>

The <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> species complex inhabits a wide variety of hosts and environments, and is a major cause of antimicrobial resistant infections. Genomics has revealed the population comprises multiple species/sub-species and hundreds of distinct co-circulating sub-lineage (SLs) that are associated with distinct gene complements. A substantial fraction of the pan-genome is predicted to be involved in metabolic functions and hence these data are consistent with metabolic differentiation at the SL level. However, this has so far remained unsubstantiated because in the past it was not possible to explore metabolic variation at scale. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics and high-throughput genome-scale metabolic modeling to systematically explore metabolic diversity across the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species complex (<i>n</i> = 7,835 genomes). We simulated growth outcomes for each isolate using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<i>n</i> = 1,278 conditions per isolate). We showed that the distributions of metabolic genes and growth capabilities are structured in the population, and confirmed that SLs exhibit unique metabolic profiles. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated reciprocal commensalistic cross-feeding between SLs, effectively extending the range of conditions supporting individual growth. We propose that these substrate specializations may promote the existence and persistence of co-circulating SLs by reducing nutrient competition and facilitating commensal interactions. Our findings have implications for understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and for the design of novel strategies to prevent opportunistic infections caused by this World Health Organization priority antimicrobial resistant pathogen.

The liver’s regenerative capacity is underscored by the plasticity potential of adult hepatocytes. In this context, hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte transdifferentiation (HCT) has been ascribed with pro-regenerative functions in animal models and is a feature of end-stage human chronic liver diseases. While dampened activities of hepatocyte identity transcription factors (TFs) underlay HCT, how the cholangiocyte transcriptional program is implemented is poorly defined. Here, we identify that HCT does not involve transitioning through a hepatoblast-like transcriptional program. Furthermore, we show that HCT primarily involves induction of the archetypal transcriptional program of monopolarized epithelial cells initially repressed in hepatocytes. Indeed, HCT requires relieving H3K27me3-mediated and polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of epithelial TF encoding genes including <i>Grainyhead Like Transcription Factor 2</i> (<i>GRHL2</i>). Ectopic expression of GRHL2 in hepatocytes, including in vivo in the adult mouse liver, induces epithelial genes reminiscent of those activated during HCT. Finally, GRHL2 is detected in human hepatocytes undergoing HCT as evidenced using samples from end-stage chronic liver diseases. Hence, HCT is a process chiefly characterized by induction of a conventional epithelial transcriptional program originally lacking in hepatocytes promoted by derepression of the master epithelial TF GRHL2.

The molecular basis of endospore formation in the model gram-positive bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> has been investigated for over half a century. Here, using high throughput and classical genetic approaches, we performed a comparative analysis of sporulation in the human pathogen <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. A transposon-sequencing screen identified >150 genes required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. As anticipated, many of the genes that are critical for sporulation in <i>B. subtilis</i> were also required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. However, we identified >50 genes that are important for sporulation in <i>B. anthracis</i> but not in <i>B. subtilis,</i> and 22 <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation genes that are absent from the <i>B. subtilis</i> genome. To validate the hits from our screen, we generated an ordered transposon-mutant library using Knockout Sudoku. Cytological analysis of a subset of the canonical sporulation-defective mutants revealed similar but not identical phenotypes in the pathogen compared to the model. We investigated several of the newly identified sporulation genes, with an in-depth analysis of one, ORF <i>04167</i>, renamed <i>ipdA</i>. Sporulating cells lacking <i>ipdA</i> are blocked in the morphological process of engulfment, generating septal bulges. An AlphaFold-Multimer screen and a classical genetic enrichment revealed that IpdA is a secreted inhibitor of the polysaccharide deacetylase PdaN. Our data support a model in which induction of IpdA at the onset of sporulation inhibits deacetylation of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG), enabling the sporulation-specific PG hydrolases to catalyze engulfment. Altogether, our studies reveal that <i>B. subtilis</i> is an excellent model for endospore formation in <i>B. anthracis</i>, while underscoring the importance of direct analysis in <i>B. anthracis</i>. The suite of tools that we have generated will catalyze the molecular dissection of sporulation and other cell biological processes in this important human pathogen.

Red blood cell production is one of the most dynamic processes, yet the underlying mechanisms responsible are only partially understood. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests a broadly applicable mechanism able to balance the maintenance of the steady-state and effective stress response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-927/v2?src=rss">StaggR: an interactive R/Shiny application for planning and visualizing staggered experimental protocols [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for parallelized execution of identical processing workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental schedules, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.
