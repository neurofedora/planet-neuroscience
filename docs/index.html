              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09422">SimBrainNet: Evaluating Brain Network Similarity for Attention Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based attention disorder research seeks to understand brain activity patterns associated with attention. Previous studies have mainly focused on identifying brain regions involved in cognitive processes or classifying Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and control subjects. However, analyzing effective brain connectivity networks for specific attentional processes and comparing them has not been explored. Therefore, in this study, we propose multivariate transfer entropy-based connectivity networks for cognitive events and introduce a new similarity measure, 'SimBrainNet', to assess these networks. A high similarity score suggests similar brain dynamics during cognitive events, indicating less attention variability. Our experiment involves 12 individuals with attention disorders (7 children and 5 adolescents). Noteworthy that child participants exhibit lower similarity scores compared to adolescents, indicating greater changes in attention. We found strong connectivity patterns in the left pre-frontal cortex for adolescent individuals compared to the child. Our study highlights the changes in attention levels across various cognitive events, offering insights into the underlying cognitive mechanisms, brain dynamics, and potential deficits in individuals with this disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09523">Monitoring Drug-Induced Brain Activity Changes with Functional Ultrasound Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a cutting-edge technology that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting backscattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). It offers high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for detailed visualization of cerebral blood flow dynamics. While fUSI has been utilized in preclinical drug development studies to explore the mechanisms of action of various drugs targeting the central nervous system, many of these studies have primarily focused on predetermined regions of interest (ROIs). This focus may overlook relevant brain activity outside these specific areas, which could influence the results. To address this limitation, we combined convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fUSI to comprehensively understand the pharmacokinetic process of Dizocilpine, also known as MK-801, a drug that blocks the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the central nervous system. CNN and class activation mapping (CAM) revealed the spatiotemporal effects of MK-801, which originated in the cortex and propagated to the hippocampus, demonstrating the ability to detect dynamic drug effects over time. Additionally, CNN and CAM assessed the impact of anesthesia on the spatiotemporal hemodynamics of the brain, revealing no distinct patterns between early and late stages. The integration of fUSI and CNN provides a powerful tool to gain insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of drug action in the brain. This combination enables a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of drug effects on brain function, potentially accelerating the development of new therapies in neuropharmacological studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09614">Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10694">Separation of Neural Drives to Muscles from Transferred Polyfunctional Nerves using Implanted Micro-electrode Arrays</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following limb amputation, neural signals for limb functions persist in the residual peripheral nerves. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) allows to redirected these signals into spare muscles to recover the neural information through electromyography (EMG). However, a significant challenge arises in separating distinct neural commands redirected from the transferred nerves to the muscles. Disentangling overlapping signals from EMG recordings remains complex, as they can contain mixed neural information that complicates limb function interpretation. To address this challenge, Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNIs) surgically partition the nerve into individual fascicles that reinnervate specific muscle grafts, isolating distinct neural sources for more precise control and interpretation of EMG signals. We introduce a novel biointerface that combines TMR surgery of polyvalent nerves with a high-density micro-electrode array implanted at a single site within a reinnervated muscle. Instead of surgically identifying distinct nerve fascicles, our approach separates all neural signals that are re-directed into a single muscle, using the high spatio-temporal selectivity of the micro-electrode array and mathematical source separation methods. We recorded EMG signals from four reinnervated muscles while volunteers performed phantom limb tasks. The decomposition of these signals into motor unit activity revealed distinct clusters of motor neurons associated with diverse functional tasks. Notably, our method enabled the extraction of multiple neural commands within a single reinnervated muscle, eliminating the need for surgical nerve division. This approach not only has the potential of enhancing prosthesis control but also uncovers mechanisms of motor neuron synergies following TMR, providing valuable insights into how the central nervous system encodes movement after reinnervation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01370">Uncovering dynamical equations of stochastic decision models using data-driven SINDy algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.01370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision formation in perceptual decision-making involves sensory evidence accumulation instantiated by the temporal integration of an internal decision variable towards some decision criterion or threshold, as described by sequential sampling theoretical models. The decision variable can be represented in the form of experimentally observable neural activities. Hence, elucidating the appropriate theoretical model becomes crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying perceptual decision formation. Existing computational methods are limited to either fitting of choice behavioural data or linear model estimation from neural activity data. In this work, we made use of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a data-driven approach, to elucidate the deterministic linear and nonlinear components of often-used stochastic decision models within reaction time task paradigms. Based on the simulated decision variable activities of the models, SINDy, enhanced with approaches using multiple trials, could readily estimate the dynamical equations, choice accuracy and decision time of the models across a range of signal-to-noise ratio values. In particular, SINDy performed the best using the more memory intensive multi-trial approach while trial-averaging of parameters performed more moderately. The single-trial approach, although expectedly not performing as well, may be useful for real-time modelling. Taken together, our work offers alternative approaches for SINDy to uncover the dynamics in perceptual decision-making, and more generally, for first-passage time problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16308">Compression-based inference of network motif sets</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2311.16308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred as "building blocks of complex networks". Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enables the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. The statistical inference of network motifs is however fraught with difficulties, from defining and sampling the right null model to accounting for the large number of possible motifs and their potential correlations in statistical testing. Here we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. The minimum description length principle allows us to select the most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. The approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on a priori specification of an appropriate null model. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which guarantees more robust statistical inference. Our approach overcomes the common problems in classic testing-based motif analysis. We apply our methodology to perform comparative connectomics by evaluating the compressibility and the circuit motifs of a range of synaptic-resolution neural connectomes.

                arXiv:2409.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the most fundamental unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of leveraging advances in AI to construct virtual cells, high-fidelity simulations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions that are directly learned from biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of such AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using virtual instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions has come into reach.

                arXiv:2409.16838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at clean image classification, they struggle to classify images corrupted with different common corruptions, limiting their real-world applicability. Recent work has shown that incorporating a CNN front-end block that simulates some features of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Here, we expand on this approach by introducing two novel biologically-inspired CNN model families that incorporate a new front-end block designed to simulate pre-cortical visual processing. RetinaNet, a hybrid architecture containing the novel front-end followed by a standard CNN back-end, shows a relative robustness improvement of 12.3% when compared to the standard model; and EVNet, which further adds a V1 block after the pre-cortical front-end, shows a relative gain of 18.5%. The improvement in robustness was observed for all the different corruption categories, though accompanied by a small decrease in clean image accuracy, and generalized to a different back-end architecture. These findings show that simulating multiple stages of early visual processing in CNN early layers provides cumulative benefits for model robustness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93656">Contrasting responses to aridity by different-sized decomposers cause similar decomposition rates across a precipitation gradient</a></h4>

              
                Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigates the classification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using electroencephalography (EEG) Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) spectrograms and audio Mel-spectrogram data of 52 subjects. The objective is to develop a multimodal classification model that integrates audio and EEG data to accurately identify depressive tendencies. Methods: We utilized the Multimodal open dataset for Mental Disorder Analysis (MODMA) and trained a pre-trained Densenet121 model using transfer learning. Features from both the EEG and audio modalities were extracted and concatenated before being passed through the final classification layer. Additionally, an ablation study was conducted on both datasets separately. Results: The proposed multimodal classification model demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an Accuracy of 97.53%, Precision of 98.20%, F1 Score of 97.76%, and Recall of 97.32%. A confusion matrix was also used to evaluate the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness. Conclusions: The paper presents a robust multimodal classification approach that outperforms state-of-the-art methods with potential application in clinical diagnostics for depression assessment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-929/v3?src=rss">Container buildings used for residential and business purposes in Johannesburg, South Africa and potential heat-related health risks [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Outdoor and indoor air temperature affects human health and wellbeing. Climate change projections suggest that global temperatures will continue to increase, and this poses a threat to health. Buildings (for housing and business purposes) that can protect humans from the adverse effects of temperature are essential, especially in the context of climate change. Method In this cross-sectional study, we measured the indoor temperature inside shipping containers comprising a seven-storey block of apartments and businesses in Johannesburg, South Africa for 14 days. We assessed indoor temperature and relative humidity; evaluated measured temperatures in relation to thresholds known to be associated with adverse health risks; and sought to understand heat-health perceptions and symptoms of people living and working in shipping container units. Results Median indoor apparent temperature (AT) (a combination of temperature and relative humidity) was 16°C with values ranging from 6°C (observed at 8:00) to 42°C (observed at 17:00). Insulated units had temperatures between 2°C and 9°C cooler than the uninsulated unit. Heat-health risks from AT exposure were likely in all units, although there was variation in the number of occurrences that AT measurements exceeded the four symptom bands of caution, extreme caution, danger and extreme danger. Indoor AT was found to be 7°C higher on average when compared to outdoor AT. Some participants believed that their units were hot during hot weather and most people opened windows or did nothing during hot weather. Few participants reported experiencing adverse heat-health impacts, except for experiencing headaches (58%) and feeling tired or weak (40%). Conclusion Residents, tenants, or business owners using shipping containers should consider insulation installation and adequate windows/air conditioning for ventilation, especially in hot climates. Further research and awareness regarding heat-health risks of living or working in these spaces is needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1287/v2?src=rss">An assessment of the factors contributing to the unavailability of drugs at outpatient pharmacy of tertiary care hospital: an observational study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Throughout history and up until the present, there has been a medicine shortage. In the early 1920s, there was a shortage of insulin, which is when drug scarcity first appeared in the records. Drug shortages are now more prevalent globally than they were back then. The goal of this essay is to pinpoint the key components that make up a definition for medication shortages and to pinpoint the circumstances that should be considered when reporting drug shortages in databases. Understanding the factors that led certain organizations to create their own definition of a medicine shortage was crucial for achieving these goals. The pharmaceutical regulatory environment can be connected to several reasons why there are medication shortages, including parallel trading, quality standards, and business choices to halt or reduce manufacturing. The many rules governing medicine shortages have not yet been the subject of a thorough investigation. This protocol’s objective is to analyze the pertinent legislative and regulatory frameworks in the European pharmaceutical system that affect medication shortages. The objectives of the study will be the non–availability of drugs at an outpatient pharmacy and to analyze the reason of non–availability of drugs. Methods An observational study will be adopted in this study. It includes a collection of data from the patient coming to the outpatient pharmacy of AVBRH Sawangi (Meghe) Wardha. Expected result It can lead to delayed treatment for patients seeking alternative medication. It can also lead to increased healthcare costs if patients seek alternative treatments that are more expensive or require additional medical care. The unavailability of drugs can also lead to frustration and anxiety for patients who need medication to manage their health condition. It can also negatively impact the reputation of the hospital.

                Past research aimed at service recovery has focused on actions that are taken to retain customers, and the possibility of overcoming the mistakes of service delivery, though the multidimensional nature of the service recovery process has begun to move beyond the complaint handling process. In this paper, we identify the most important issues addressed in service recovery and present a framework for addressing them. We used an extensive integrative review methodology. Between 1988 and 2017 the number of articles in these journals was kept between 26 and 30. The majority took a business perspective to study services recovery, while a minority took an inter-disciplinarity perspective. The study’s findings are expected to provide insights into the antecedents and consequences of service recovery performance, particularly how job resources and demands influence employee burnout and work engagement, which in turn affect service recovery performance and customer perceptions of justice. The research aims to contribute to the discourse on service recovery by building a multi-level model that explains the service recovery performance of frontline employees and the impact of the service recovery system on customer justice perceptions. Thus, this research is expected to contribute to robust conclusions on the antecedents and consequences of employee service recovery performance nested within the unit-level construct, i.e., the service recovery system.

                Background Over the past few decades, World Health Organization (WHO) has made massive efforts to promote the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV), one of the top ten priority pathogens for research and development under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Emerging Infections. To date, several vaccines are at different stages of development. In this scenario, a validated and standardised assay to measure LASV neutralising antibodies is urgently needed for vaccine development and comparison. Methods The neutralisation assay remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Here we have proposed a safe and validated pseudotyped neutralisation assay for LASV, taking advantage of the development of the first WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-Lassa Fever (NIBSC code 21/332). Results and Conclusions The proposed results demonstrate that the pseudotyped luciferase neutralisation assay is a specific serological test for the measurement of LASV neutralising antibodies without cross-reacting with standard sera specific for heterologous viral infections. In addition, the assay is accurate, precise, and linear according to criteria and statistical analyses defined and accepted by international guidelines.

                Background Globalization has expanded the scope of business with many companies relying on the contribution of expatriates to fill skills gap in foreign business operations, transferring management knowledge, launching new operations, and coordinating activities on a global scale. Expatriates, however, face challenges that stem from cultural differences. Their commitment levels depend on how well and how quickly they adjust to the unfamiliar culture(s) of the host country. Methods This study sought to investigate the implications of work factors on commitment of expatriates working in selected mission hospitals in Kenya. It was anchored on the provisions of the Three-Component Commitment and International Adjustment theories and a randomly selected sample of 112 respondents from a target population of 156 medical expatriates. Results and conclusions The results depicted that work-related factors significantly affected employee commitment (β= -1.033, p=0.000). To conclude, we argue that employee commitment amongst expatriates can be enhanced through work factors’ cross-cultural adjustment. We further recommend setting up of cross-cultural adjustment policies for expatriate workers within the workplace, particularly in mission hospitals.

                Background In completely edentulous patients, maintaining the patient’s temporomandibular joint (TMJ) health and intraoral components is very essential, which can be achieved by an accurate interocclusal record, which can be taken by various materials and also at various stages. Simulation of the temporomandibular joint anatomy and mandibular movements is possible on a semi-adjustable articulator, which is widely used in prosthodontics. Transferring the record on articulator is a critical step in the fabrication of complete dentures, so it should be done precisely to reduce chair side time and also to avoid complications for patients. This study examines which material is more accurate and records which stage gives more precision by comparing the Condylar guidance on radiographs. This is because it is a relatively consistent bony landmark and can be used to correlate with clinical methods in terms of verification. The objective is to determine the inter occlusal records created during the Jaw Relation stage and Try-in using reinforced wax and Polyvinyl siloxane and compare these values to the condylar guidance obtained by orthopantomogram (OPG). Methods Recording the Condylar Guidance value on OPG by tracing the Glenoid fossa, Articular eminence, and the Frankfurt Horizontal Plane. Followed by conventional steps in making complete dentures at jaw relation and try-in stage. We will record values of condylar guidance with the two different Interocclusal record materials. Expected result It will help the clinicians to gain knowledge about obtaining precise condylar inclination angle by using suitable interocclusal record materials. Conclusions This study will help us to obtain condylar inclination, which in turn helps the patient’s satisfaction as it preserves the intraoral components and health of TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1228/v1?src=rss">Recycling of collagen from solid tannery waste and prospective utilization as adhesives. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract This study explores the innovative potential of recycled collagen derived from tannery waste for use in high-performance adhesive formulations. The leather industry generates significant amounts of solid waste, primarily from chromium-tanned leather, which poses substantial environmental challenges. Recent advancements in recycling techniques have opened new avenues for repurposing this waste, particularly through collagen extraction, which comprises about 30-35% of tannery residues. This research systematically reviews the methods and applications of collagen extraction, highlighting the material’s versatility and environmental benefits when used as a bio-adhesive. The review identifies key challenges such as low water resistance, shear strength, and adhesiveness in collagen-based adhesives compared to synthetic counterparts. However, innovative solutions are emerging, including the incorporation of silane coupling agents and cross-linking technologies that significantly improve the water resistance and mechanical properties of these adhesives. Economic analyses further support the viability of using tannery waste-derived collagen in adhesive production, aligning with global sustainability goals and reducing reliance on petrochemical-based adhesives. Despite these advancements, the transition from laboratory research to commercial applications remains a significant challenge. Current studies primarily focus on small-scale experiments, with limited pilot-scale studies available. Nonetheless, the potential for collagen-based adhesives to replace harmful chemicals in industrial applications is promising, especially in sectors requiring biodegradable and non-toxic materials. This review concludes that while significant progress has been made, further research is necessary to overcome existing limitations and fully realize the commercial potential of collagen-based adhesives derived from tannery waste.

                Background Each year, over 340,000 diabetic patients across the world travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage. As they carried out important rituals, several complications might be encountered, particularly foot lesions. We’ve been therefore interested, through this study, in the assessment of podiatric risk in diabetic pilgrims. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in the region of Sousse, Tunisia. The evaluation of diabetic patients preparing for the pilgrimage was conducted in two phases, before and after the pilgrimage. Results Forty-three diabetic patients planning to perform pilgrimage were included in the study. Post-pilgrimage clinical exams revealed hyperkeratosis (96.8%) and superficial fungal infections (61.3%) as the most common podiatric lesions. Foot ulcers attributed to trauma from walking were found in 7% of patients. Our data showed a significant association between foot ulcer risk and lower total cholesterol (p=0.02), HDL cholesterol (p=0.02), LDL cholesterol (p=0.01), as well as higher triglyceride levels (p=0.04) only in univariate analysis. Other diabetes-related risk factors did not show significant correlations. Conclusion Given the increased risk of foot lesions in diabetic pilgrims, a thorough assessment and tailored management based on individual risk levels are essential before, during, and after the pilgrimage.

The purpose of the scoping review was to explore ‘What does the evidence say about the ‘problem’ with ‘poor’ research culture, what are the benefits of ‘good’ research culture, and what does ‘good’ look like?’ Aims To examine the peer-reviewed and grey literature to explore the interplay between research culture, open research, career paths, recognition and rewards, and equality, diversity, and inclusion, as part of a larger programme of activity for a research institution. Methods A scoping review was undertaken. Six databases were searched along with grey literature. Eligible literature had relevance to academic research institutions, addressed research culture, and were published between January 2017 to May 2022. Evidence was mapped and themed to specific categories. The search strategy, screening and analysis took place between April-May 2022. Results 1666 titles and abstracts, and 924 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 253 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. A purposive sampling of relevant websites was drawn from to complement the review, resulting in 102 records included in the review. Key areas for consideration were identified across the four themes of job security, wellbeing and equality of opportunity, teamwork and interdisciplinary, and research quality and accountability. Conclusions There are opportunities for research institutions to improve their own practice, however institutional solutions cannot act in isolation. Research institutions and research funders need to work together to build a more sustainable and inclusive research culture that is diverse in nature and supports individuals’ well-being, career progression and performance.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Pakistan served as a host for more than 1.4 million Afghan refugees for more than 40 years. Access to health care is the most important issue faced by refugees, because they might be at a higher risk for certain diseases. This risk can be attributed to a lack of awareness of health care facilities, health beliefs, inadequate hygiene, cultural differences, and malnutrition. Health of individuals is closely associated with their quality of life. Quality of life over the whole lifespan is pivotal to overall life satisfaction. It includes physical wellbeing, mental health, education, occupation, income, personal safety, as well as (religious) freedom. Until now, the health status of Afghan refugees has never been comprehensively investigated in Pakistan. Therefore, an assessment in this regard is needed to explore their health-related quality of life, for securing their human right to health. Methods A cross-sectional study has been designed to describe and explain the health-related quality of life of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Multistage cluster sampling was applied for selection of study participants. The number of respondents from two regions in Pakistan was drawn through a proportionate sampling technique. A quantitative research method using pre-validated questionnaires was used for data collection. The questionnaire included items to assess well-being, mental health, health literacy, and factors affecting health and health care. Descriptive analysis was used, whereas inferential statistical tests (binary logistic regression model) was also performed. The study received ethically permission by the Advanced Studies and Research Board of the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Discussion The assessment of Afghan refugee’s quality of life in Pakistan should lead to recommendations disseminated to public and health care officials. This evidence is needed for policymaking related to adequate measures for improving health conditions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

                Background Regular exercise during pregnancy improves fetal and mother outcomes unless contraindicated. Despite being generally safe and beneficial, non-participation in prenatal activity is relatively common among most of the Asian countries due to multiple reasons. In India, findings related to maternal physical activity and its determinant are scant. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the physical activity level and associated factors among pregnant women attending maternal healthcare services in Dakshina Kannada District in India. Method A multi-center community-based cross-sectional study was conducted recruiting 424 pregnant women attending the maternal healthcare facilities at four taluks of Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka state, India. A structured questionnaire that collected information on socio-demographic, and maternal characteristics was used and the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire tool was used to determine the physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression model was used to determine the predictor variables. Results The prevalence of physical inactivity was 40.33%. Physical activity is favorable among pregnant women aged between 25 to 29 years, residing in an urban locality, diploma or graduation and being housewife. Determinants of physical inactivity during pregnancy were sedentary occupation (AOR 7.22, 95% CI 2.2, 23.4), low family income (AOR 3.16, 95% CI 1.414, 7.054), having one child (AOR 5.4, 95% CI 1.3, 22.2), during 2nd trimester (AOR 2.513, 95% CI 1.5, 4.23) and self-reported lack of time (AOR 2.884, 95% CI 1.410, 5.901). Conclusion and recommendation A moderate proportion of pregnant women reported physical inactivity during pregnancy in the Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. Physical inactivity was associated with sedentary employment, low income, number of children, trimester, and time constraints. Measures should be undertaken to promote the importance of recommended levels of physical activity, enhance access, and support system targeting pregnant women.

                <p>by Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz, Guido Uguzzoni, Kévin Ricard, Francesca Anselmi, Clément Nizak, Andrea Pagnani, Olivier Rivoire</p>

Exquisite binding specificity is essential for many protein functions but is difficult to engineer. Many biotechnological or biomedical applications require the discrimination of very similar ligands, which poses the challenge of designing protein sequences with highly specific binding profiles. Experimental methods for generating specific binders rely on <i>in vitro</i> selection, which is limited in terms of library size and control over specificity profiles. Additional control was recently demonstrated through high-throughput sequencing and downstream computational analysis. Here we follow such an approach to demonstrate the design of specific antibodies beyond those probed experimentally. We do so in a context where very similar epitopes need to be discriminated, and where these epitopes cannot be experimentally dissociated from other epitopes present in the selection. Our approach involves the identification of different binding modes, each associated with a particular ligand against which the antibodies are either selected or not. Using data from phage display experiments, we show that the model successfully disentangles these modes, even when they are associated with chemically very similar ligands. Additionally, we demonstrate and validate experimentally the computational design of antibodies with customized specificity profiles, either with specific high affinity for a particular target ligand, or with cross-specificity for multiple target ligands. Overall, our results showcase the potential of leveraging a biophysical model learned from selections against multiple ligands to design proteins with tailored specificity, with applications to protein engineering extending beyond the design of antibodies.

                <p>by Richard D. J. G. Ho, Kasumi Kishi, Maciej Majka, Anna Kicheva, Marcin Zagorski</p>

A tight regulation of morphogen production is key for morphogen gradient formation and thereby for reproducible and organised organ development. Although many genetic interactions involved in the establishment of morphogen production domains are known, the biophysical mechanisms of morphogen source formation are poorly understood. Here we addressed this by focusing on the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the vertebrate neural tube. Shh is produced by the adjacently located notochord and by the floor plate of the neural tube. Using a data-constrained computational screen, we identified different possible mechanisms by which floor plate formation can occur, only one of which is consistent with experimental data. In this mechanism, the floor plate is established rapidly in response to Shh from the notochord and the dynamics of regulatory interactions within the neural tube. In this process, uniform activators and Shh-dependent repressors are key for establishing the floor plate size. Subsequently, the floor plate becomes insensitive to Shh and increases in size due to tissue growth, leading to scaling of the floor plate with neural tube size. In turn, this results in scaling of the Shh amplitude with tissue growth. Thus, this mechanism ensures a separation of time scales in floor plate formation, so that the floor plate domain becomes growth-dependent after an initial rapid establishment phase. Our study raises the possibility that the time scale separation between specification and growth might be a common strategy for scaling the morphogen gradient amplitude in growing organs. The model that we developed provides a new opportunity for quantitative studies of morphogen source formation in growing tissues.

From a game of darts to neurorehabilitation, the ability to explore and fine tune our movements is critical for success. Past work has shown that exploratory motor behaviour in response to reinforcement (reward) feedback is closely linked with the basal ganglia, while movement corrections in response to error feedback is commonly attributed to the cerebellum. While our past work has shown these processes are dissociable during adaptation, it is unknown how they uniquely impact exploratory behaviour. Moreover, converging neuroanatomical evidence shows direct and indirect connections between the basal ganglia and cerebellum, suggesting that there is an interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based neural processes. Here we examine the unique roles and interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based processes on sensorimotor exploration in a neurotypical population. We also recruited individuals with Parkinson’s disease to gain mechanistic insight into the role of the basal ganglia and associated reinforcement pathways in sensorimotor exploration. Across three reaching experiments, participants were given either reinforcement feedback, error feedback, or simultaneously both reinforcement & error feedback during a sensorimotor task that encouraged exploration. Our reaching results, a re-analysis of a previous gait experiment, and our model suggests that in isolation, reinforcement-based and error-based processes respectively boost and suppress exploration. When acting in concert, we found that reinforcement-based and error-based processes interact by mutually opposing one another. Finally, we found that those with Parkinson’s disease had decreased exploration when receiving reinforcement feedback, supporting the notion that compromised reinforcement-based processes reduces the ability to explore new motor actions. Understanding the unique and interacting roles of reinforcement-based and error-based processes may help to inform neurorehabilitation paradigms where it is important to discover new and successful motor actions.

                <p>by Philip Greulich</p>

The fate choices of stem cells between self-renewal and differentiation are often tightly regulated by <i>juxtacrine</i> (cell-cell contact) signalling. Here, we assess how the interplay between cell division, cell fate choices, and juxtacrine signalling can affect the macroscopic ordering of cell types in self-renewing epithelial sheets, by studying a simple spatial cell fate model with cells being arranged on a 2D lattice. We show in this model that if cells commit to their fate directly upon cell division, macroscopic patches of cells of the same type emerge, if at least a small proportion of divisions are symmetric, except if signalling interactions are laterally inhibiting. In contrast, if cells are first ‘licensed’ to differentiate, yet retaining the possibility to return to their naive state, macroscopic order only emerges if the signalling strength exceeds a critical threshold: if then the signalling interactions are laterally inducing, macroscopic patches emerge as well. Lateral inhibition, on the other hand, can in that case generate periodic patterns of alternating cell types (checkerboard pattern), yet only if the proportion of symmetric divisions is sufficiently low. These results can be understood theoretically by an analogy to phase transitions in spin systems known from statistical physics.

                <p>by Ankur Kamboj, Rajiv Ranganathan, Xiaobo Tan, Vaibhav Srivastava</p>

Conventional approaches to enhance movement coordination, such as providing instructions and visual feedback, are often inadequate in complex motor tasks with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). To effectively address coordination deficits in such complex motor systems, it becomes imperative to develop interventions grounded in a model of human motor learning; however, modeling such learning processes is challenging due to the large DoFs. In this paper, we present a computational motor learning model that leverages the concept of motor synergies to extract low-dimensional learning representations in the high-dimensional motor space and the internal model theory of motor control to capture both fast and slow motor learning processes. We establish the model’s convergence properties and validate it using data from a target capture game played by human participants. We study the influence of model parameters on several motor learning trade-offs such as speed-accuracy, exploration-exploitation, satisficing, and flexibility-performance, and show that the human motor learning system tunes these parameters to optimize learning and various output performance metrics.

A core function of the olfactory system is to determine the valence of odors. In humans, central processing of odor valence perception has been shown to take form already within the olfactory bulb (OB), but the neural mechanisms by which this important information is communicated to, and from, the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex, PC) in humans are not known. To assess communication between the 2 nodes, we simultaneously measured odor-dependent neural activity in the OB and PC from human participants while obtaining trial-by-trial valence ratings. By doing so, we could determine when subjective valence information was communicated, what kind of information was transferred, and how the information was transferred (i.e., in which frequency band). Support vector machine (SVM) learning was used on the coherence spectrum and frequency-resolved Granger causality to identify valence-dependent differences in functional and effective connectivity between the OB and PC. We found that the OB communicates subjective odor valence to the PC in the gamma band shortly after odor onset, while the PC subsequently feeds valence-related information back to the OB in the beta band. Decoding accuracy was better for negative than positive valence, suggesting a focus on negative valence. Critically, we replicated these findings in an independent data set using additional odors across a larger perceived valence range. Combined, these results demonstrate that the OB and PC communicate levels of subjective odor pleasantness across multiple frequencies, at specific time points, in a direction-dependent pattern in accordance with a two-stage model of odor processing.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002840">Widespread regulation of the maternal transcriptome by Nanos in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Marhabaie, Tammy H. Wharton, Sung Yun Kim, Robin P. Wharton</p>

The translational repressor Nanos (Nos) regulates a single target, maternal <i>hunchback</i> (<i>hb)</i> mRNA, to govern abdominal segmentation in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Nos is recruited to sites in the 3′ UTR of <i>hb</i> mRNA in collaboration with the sequence-specific RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum); on its own, Nos has no binding specificity. Nos is expressed at other stages of development, but very few mRNA targets that might mediate its action at these stages have been described. Nor has it been clear whether Nos is targeted to other mRNAs in concert with Pum or via other mechanisms. In this report, we identify mRNAs targeted by Nos via 2 approaches. First, we identify mRNAs depleted upon expression of a chimera bearing Nos fused to the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) factor Upf1. We find that, in addition to <i>hb</i>, Upf1-Nos depletes approximately 2,600 mRNAs from the maternal transcriptome in early embryos. Virtually all of these appear to be targeted in a canonical, <i>hb</i>-like manner in concert with Pum. In a second, more conventional approach, we identify mRNAs that are stabilized during the maternal zygotic transition (MZT) in embryos from <i>nos</i><sup>-</sup> females. Most (86%) of the 1,185 mRNAs regulated by Nos are also targeted by Upf1-Nos, validating use of the chimera. Previous work has shown that 60% of the maternal transcriptome is degraded in early embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs targeted by Upf1-Nos are hypoadenylated and inefficiently translated at the ovary–embryo transition; they are subsequently degraded in the early embryo, accounting for 59% of all destabilized maternal mRNAs. We suggest that the late ovarian burst of Nos represses a large fraction of the maternal transcriptome, priming it for later degradation by other factors in the embryo.

Inhibitory interneurons are pivotal components of cortical circuits. Beyond providing inhibition, they have been proposed to coordinate the firing of excitatory neurons within cell assemblies. While the roles of specific interneuron subtypes have been extensively studied, their influence on pyramidal cell synchrony in vivo remains elusive. Employing an all-optical approach in mice, we simultaneously recorded hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells and probed the network influence of individual interneurons using optogenetics. We demonstrate that CA1 interneurons form a functionally interconnected network that promotes synchrony through disinhibition during awake immobility, while preserving endogenous cell assemblies. Our network model underscores the importance of both cell assemblies and dense, unspecific interneuron connectivity in explaining our experimental findings, suggesting that interneurons may operate not only via division of labor but also through concerted activity.

                <p>by Kevin Yuswan, Xiaofei Sun, Erina Kuranaga, Daiki Umetsu</p>

Epithelial tissues undergo cell turnover both during development and for homeostatic maintenance. Removal of cells is coordinated with the increase in number of newly dividing cells to maintain barrier function of the tissue. In <i>Drosophila</i> metamorphosis, larval epidermal cells (LECs) are replaced by adult precursor cells called histoblasts. Removal of LECs must counterbalance the exponentially increasing adult histoblasts. Previous work showed that the LEC removal accelerates as endocytic activity decreases throughout all LECs. Here, we show that the acceleration is accompanied by a mode switching from isolated single-cell apoptosis to clustered ones induced by the endocytic activity reduction. We identify the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway via extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) activity as the main components downstream of endocytic activity in LECs. The reduced ERK activity, caused by the decrease in endocytic activity, is responsible for the apoptotic mode switching. Initially, ERK is transiently activated in normal LECs surrounding a single apoptotic LEC in a ligand-dependent manner, preventing clustered cell death. Following the reduction of endocytic activity, LEC apoptosis events do not provoke these transient ERK up-regulations, resulting in the acceleration of the cell elimination rate by frequent clustered apoptosis. These findings contrasted with the common perspective that clustered apoptosis is disadvantageous. Instead, switching to clustered apoptosis is required to accommodate the growth of neighboring tissues.

                <p>by Fanny Mazzamurro, Jason Baby Chirakadavil, Isabelle Durieux, Ludovic Poiré, Julie Plantade, Christophe Ginevra, Sophie Jarraud, Gottfried Wilharm, Xavier Charpentier, Eduardo P. C. Rocha</p>

Natural transformation is the only mechanism of genetic exchange controlled by the recipient bacteria. We quantified its rates in 786 clinical strains of the human pathogens <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> (Lp) and 496 clinical and environmental strains of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (Ab). The analysis of transformation rates in the light of phylogeny revealed they evolve by a mixture of frequent small changes and a few large quick jumps across 6 orders of magnitude. In standard conditions close to half of the strains of Lp and a more than a third in Ab are below the detection limit and thus presumably non-transformable. Ab environmental strains tend to have higher transformation rates than the clinical ones. Transitions to non-transformability were frequent and usually recent, suggesting that they are deleterious and subsequently purged by natural selection. Accordingly, we find that transformation decreases genetic linkage in both species, which might accelerate adaptation. Intragenomic conflicts with chromosomal mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and plasmids could explain these transitions and a GWAS confirmed systematic negative associations between transformation and MGEs: plasmids and other conjugative elements in Lp, prophages in Ab, and transposable elements in both. In accordance with the hypothesis of modulation of transformation rates by genetic conflicts, transformable strains have fewer MGEs in both species and some MGEs inactivate genes implicated in the transformation with heterologous DNA (in Ab). Innate defense systems against MGEs are associated with lower transformation rates, especially restriction-modification systems. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas systems are associated with higher transformation rates suggesting that adaptive defense systems may facilitate cell protection from MGEs while preserving genetic exchanges by natural transformation. Ab and Lp have different lifestyles, gene repertoires, and population structure. Nevertheless, they exhibit similar trends in terms of variation of transformation rates and its determinants, suggesting that genetic conflicts could drive the evolution of natural transformation in many bacteria.

<p>Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons involved in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and potential therapeutic interventions targeting PV interneurons. Multiply genetic and environmental factors could lead to fewer PV interneurons or downregulation of PV protein. Genetic mutations or epigenetic modifications could directly affect PV interneurons development. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction could also impact the integrity of PV interneurons and further disrupt neuronal development and migration. Aberrant PV interneurons result in functional abnormalities within gamma oscillations and neuronal circuits. Targeting PV interneurons presents a promising therapeutic strategy for ASD. Optogenetic stimulation and cell therapy have the potential to restore the function of PV interneurons and alleviate ASD symptoms.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As an important subtype of GABAergic interneurons, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play a critical role in regulating cortical circuits and neural networks. Abnormalities in the development or function of PV interneurons have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and language deficits. In this review, we focus on the abnormalities of PV interneurons in ASD, including quantity and function and discuss the underlying mechanisms of impairments in PV interneurons in the pathology of ASD. Finally, we propose potential therapeutic approaches targeting PV interneurons, such as transplanting MGE progenitor cells and utilizing optogenetic stimulation in the treatment of ASD.</p>

                Root-synthesized secondary metabolites are critical quality-conferring compounds of foods, plant-derived medicines, and beverages. However, information at a single-cell level on root-specific secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored. <span class="small-caps">L</span>-Theanine, an important quality component of tea, is primarily synthesized in roots, from which it is then transported to new shoots of tea plant. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived map for the tea plant root, which enabled cell-type-specific analysis of glutamate and ethylamine (two precursors of theanine biosynthesis) metabolism, and theanine biosynthesis, storage, and transport. Our findings support a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. This study provides novel insights into theanine metabolism and regulation, at the single-cell level, and offers an example for studying root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.

                Perceiving emotions from the movements of other biological entities is critical for human survival and interpersonal interactions. Here, we report that emotional information conveyed by point-light biological motion (BM) triggered automatic physiological responses as reflected in pupil size. Specifically, happy BM evoked larger pupil size than neutral and sad BM, while sad BM induced a smaller pupil response than neutral BM. Moreover, this happy over sad pupil dilation effect is negatively correlated with individual autistic traits. Notably, emotional BM with only local motion features retained could also exert modulations on pupils. Compared with intact BM, both happy and sad local BM evoked stronger pupil responses than neutral local BM starting from an earlier time point, with no difference between the happy and sad conditions. These results revealed a fine-grained pupil-related emotional modulation induced by intact BM and a coarse but rapid modulation by local BM, demonstrating multi-level processing of emotions in life motion signals. Taken together, our findings shed new light on BM emotion processing, and highlight the potential of utilizing the emotion-modulated pupil response to facilitate the diagnosis of social cognitive disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89701">Systems analysis of miR-199a/b-5p and multiple miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Changes in chondrocyte gene expression can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and so recognition of the regulative processes during chondrogenesis can lead to a better understanding of OA. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in chondrocytes/OA, and we have used a combined experimental, bioinformatic, and systems biology approach to explore the multiple miRNA–mRNA interactions that regulate chondrogenesis. A longitudinal chondrogenesis bioinformatic analysis identified paralogues miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Experimental work in human cells demonstrated alteration of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression led to significant inverse modulation of key chondrogenic genes and extracellular matrix production. miR-199a/b-5p targets <i>FZD6, ITGA3</i> and <i>CAV1</i> were identified by inhibition experiments and verified as direct targets by luciferase assay. The experimental work was used to generate and parameterise a multi-miRNA 14-day chondrogenesis kinetic model to be used as a repository for the experimental work and as a resource for further investigation of this system. This is the first multi-miRNA model of a chondrogenesis-based system, and highlights the complex relationships between regulatory miRNAs, and their target mRNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92925">Delivery of a Jagged1-PEG-MAL hydrogel with pediatric human bone cells regenerates critically sized craniofacial bone defects</a></h4>

              
                Current treatments for congenital and acquired craniofacial (CF) bone abnormalities are limited and costly. Conventional methods involve surgical correction, short-term stabilization, and long-term bone grafting, which may include problematic allografts and limited autografts. While bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been used for bone regeneration, it can cause bone overgrowth and life-threatening inflammation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapies, though promising, are not Food and Drug Administration approved and are resource intensive. Thus, there is a need for effective, affordable, and less side-effect-prone bone regenerative therapies. Previous research demonstrated that JAGGED1 induces osteoblast commitment in murine cranial neural crest cells through a NOTCH-dependent non-canonical pathway involving JAK2–STAT5. We hypothesize that delivery of JAGGED1 and induction of its downstream NOTCH non-canonical signaling in pediatric human osteoblasts constitutes an effective bone regenerative treatment. Delivering pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like cells to an in vivo murine bone loss model of a critically sized cranial defect, we identified that JAGGED1 promotes human pediatric osteoblast commitment and bone formation through p70 S6K phosphorylation. This approach highlights the potential of JAGGED1 and its downstream activators as innovative treatments for pediatric CF bone loss.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98841">Operation regimes of spinal circuits controlling locomotion and the role of supraspinal drives and sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion in mammals is directly controlled by the spinal neuronal network, operating under the control of supraspinal signals and somatosensory feedback that interact with each other. However, the functional architecture of the spinal locomotor network, its operation regimes, and the role of supraspinal and sensory feedback in different locomotor behaviors, including at different speeds, remain unclear. We developed a computational model of spinal locomotor circuits receiving supraspinal drives and limb sensory feedback that could reproduce multiple experimental data obtained in intact and spinal-transected cats during tied-belt and split-belt treadmill locomotion. We provide evidence that the spinal locomotor network operates in different regimes depending on locomotor speed. In an intact system, at slow speeds (&lt;0.4 m/s), the spinal network operates in a non-oscillating state-machine regime and requires sensory feedback or external inputs for phase transitions. Removing sensory feedback related to limb extension prevents locomotor oscillations at slow speeds. With increasing speed and supraspinal drives, the spinal network switches to a flexor-driven oscillatory regime and then to a classical half-center regime. Following spinal transection, the model predicts that the spinal network can only operate in the state-machine regime. Our results suggest that the spinal network operates in different regimes for slow exploratory and fast escape locomotor behaviors, making use of different control mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100821">A comparative study of the cryo-EM structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)</a></h4>

              
                The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a large multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through the cell cycle by orchestrating the timely proteolysis of mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins. Although structures of multiple human APC/C complexes have been extensively studied over the past decade, the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> APC/C has been less extensively investigated. Here, we describe medium resolution structures of three <i>S. cerevisiae</i> APC/C complexes: unphosphorylated apo-APC/C and the ternary APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup>-substrate complex, and phosphorylated apo-APC/C. Whereas the overall architectures of human and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> APC/C are conserved, as well as the mechanism of CDH1 inhibition by CDK-phosphorylation, specific variations exist, including striking differences in the mechanism of coactivator-mediated stimulation of E2 binding, and the activation of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> by phosphorylation. In contrast to human APC/C in which coactivator induces a conformational change of the catalytic module APC2:APC11 to allow E2 binding, in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> apo-APC/C the catalytic module is already positioned to bind E2. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a phospho-regulatable auto-inhibitory segment of APC1, that in the unphosphorylated human APC/C, sterically blocks the CDC20<sup>C-box</sup> binding site of APC8. Thus, although the functions of APC/C are conserved from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to humans, molecular details relating to their regulatory mechanisms differ.

                Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels widely used to optically activate or silence selected electrogenic cells, such as individual brain neurons. Here, we describe identifying and characterizing a set of anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) from diverse taxa and representing various branches of the ChR phylogenetic tree. The <i>Mantoniella squamata</i> ACR (MsACR1) showed high sensitivity to yellow-green light (<i>λ</i><sub>max</sub> at 555 nm) and was further engineered for optogenetic applications. A single amino-acid substitution that mimicked red-light-sensitive rhodopsins like Chrimson shifted the photosensitivity 20 nm toward red light and accelerated photocurrent kinetics. Hence, it was named red and accelerated ACR, raACR. Both wild-type and mutant are capable optical silencers at low light intensities in mouse neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while raACR offers a higher temporal resolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100987">TRPML1 gating modulation by allosteric mutations and lipids</a></h4>

              
                Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a lysosomal cation channel whose loss-of-function mutations directly cause the lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). TRPML1 can be allosterically regulated by various ligands including natural lipids and small synthetic molecules and the channel undergoes a global movement propagated from ligand-induced local conformational changes upon activation. In this study, we identified a functionally critical residue, Tyr404, at the C-terminus of the S4 helix, whose mutations to tryptophan and alanine yield gain- and loss-of-function channels, respectively. These allosteric mutations mimic the ligand activation or inhibition of the TRPML1 channel without interfering with ligand binding and both mutant channels are susceptible to agonist or antagonist modulation, making them better targets for screening potent TRPML1 activators and inhibitors. We also determined the high-resolution structure of TRPML1 in complex with the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, revealing the structural basis underlying this lipid inhibition. In addition, an endogenous phospholipid likely from sphingomyelin is identified in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-bound TRPML1 structure at the same hotspot for agonists and antagonists, providing a plausible structural explanation for the inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin on agonist activation.

">Tau load in select brainstem neurons predicts the severity and nature of balance deficits in the absence of cell death</a></h4>

              
                Patients with tauopathies present with profoundly different clinical symptoms, even within the same disorder. A central hypothesis in the field, well-supported by biomarker studies and post-mortem pathology, is that clinical heterogeneity reflects differential degeneration of vulnerable neuronal populations responsible for specific neurological functions. Recent work has revealed mechanisms underlying susceptibility of particular cell types, but relating tau load to disrupted behavior -- especially before cell death -- requires a targeted circuit-level approach. Here we studied two distinct balance behaviors in larval zebrafish expressing a human 0N/4R-tau allele in select populations of evolutionarily-conserved and well-characterized brainstem vestibular circuits. We observed that human tau load predicted the severity of circuit-specific deficits in posture and navigation in the absence of cell death. Targeting expression to either mid- or hindbrain balance neurons recapitulated particular deficits in posture and navigation. By parametrically linking tau load in specific neurons to early behavioral deficits, our work moves beyond cell type to close the gap between pathological and neurological conceptions of tauopathy.

                Lenses are vital components of eyes, crafted through the precise arrangement of proteins to achieve transparency and focusing power, and placed appropriately within the eye for the retina to receive sharp, focused images. Maintaining these states is challenging due to substantial post-embryonic eye and lens growth. Here, we gain insights into required processes by exploring consequences of silencing Lens3, a key lens protein, during growth in Thermonectus marmoratus sunburst diving beetle larvae. We show that lens3RNAi leads to opaque aggregates reminiscent of vertebrate lens cataracts, causing the projection of degraded images which impact behaviour in low light. Our findings uncover how complex biological lenses are constructed and further support that visual input is inconsequential for coordinated eye growth in this clade. We highlight the utility of this insect as a tractable model system to investigate the aetiology of lens cataracts and refractive errors in a sophisticated camera-type eye.

">Assembloid model to study loop circuits of the human nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits connecting the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus are fundamental networks for sensorimotor processing and their dysfunction has been consistently implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. These recursive, loop circuits have been investigated in animal models and by clinical neuroimaging, however, direct functional access to developing human neurons forming these networks has been limited. Here, we use human pluripotent stem cells to reconstruct an in vitro cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit by creating a four-part loop assembloid. More specifically, we generate regionalized neural organoids that resemble the key elements of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit, and functionally integrate them into loop assembloids using custom 3D-printed biocompatible wells. Volumetric and mesoscale calcium imaging, as well as extracellular recordings from individual parts of these assembloids reveal the emergence of synchronized patterns of neuronal activity. In addition, a multi-step rabies retrograde tracing approach demonstrate the formation of neuronal connectivity across the network in loop assembloids. Lastly, we apply this system to study heterozygous loss of ASH1L gene associated with autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome and discover aberrant synchronized activity in disease model assembloids. Taken together, this human multi-cellular platform will facilitate functional investigations of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in the context of early human development and in disease conditions.

">Inhibition Resolves Simon Conflict: Evidence from EEG Decoding</a></h4>

              
                The congruency sequence effect (CSE), a hypothesized marker of top-down cognitive control, refers to a reduced congruency effect after incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. Although this effect has been observed across various distractor interference tasks, the nature of the control processes underlying the CSE remains a topic of active debate. It has been suggested that cognitive control may resolve conflicts in information processing either by (a) enhancing the representation of goal information and/or (b) suppressing the representation of distractor information. The present study aimed to identify the conflict resolution processes within the context of the color Simon task by decoding the goal and distracting information from human scalp EEG signals. For the decoding analysis, models were trained separately for color and location attributes corresponding to goal and distractor information. Additionally, decoding accuracy was calculated in different frequency bands: theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), low beta (12-20 Hz), and high beta (20-30 Hz). Results showed that decoding accuracy for distractor information was reduced when cognitive control was activated and this pattern was only observed in the high beta-frequency band (20-30 Hz). In contrast, no such difference was observed for target information. These findings suggest that cognitive control regulates Simon conflict by inhibiting distractor representation in the brain, thereby preventing unwanted distraction-driven behaviors.

">Axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have a unique pseudo-unipolar morphology in which a stem axon bifurcates into a peripheral and a central axon, with different regenerative abilities. Whereas peripheral DRG axons regenerate, central axons are unable to regrow. Central axon regeneration can however be elicited by a prior conditioning lesion to the peripheral axon. How DRG axon asymmetry is established, remains unknown. Here we developed an in vitro system replicating DRG pseudo-unipolarization and asymmetric axon regeneration. Using this model, we observed that from early development, central DRG axons have a higher density of growing microtubules. This asymmetry was also present in vivo and was abolished by a conditioning lesion that decreased microtubule polymerization of central DRG axons. An axon-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP) signature, including the severases spastin and katanin and the microtubule regulators CRMP5 and tau, was found and shown to adapt upon conditioning lesion. Supporting its significance, interfering with the DRG MAP signature either in vitro or in vivo, readily abolished central-peripheral asymmetries in microtubule dynamics and regenerative ability. In summary, our data unveil that axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons.

">IGF-1 IMPACTS NEOCORTICAL INTERNEURON CONNECTIVITY IN EPILEPTIC SPASM GENERATION AND RESOLUTION</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about the mechanisms that generate epileptic spasms following perinatal brain injury. Recent studies have implicated reduced levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in these patients brains. Other studies have reported low levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. In the TTX brain injury model of epileptic spasms, we undertook experiments to evaluate the impact of IGF-1 deficiencies on neocortical interneurons and their role in spasms. Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses revealed that neocortical interneurons that express glutamic acid decarboxylase, parvalbumin, or synaptotagmin 2 co-express IGF-1. In epileptic rats, expression of these three interneuron markers were reduced in the neocortex. IGF-1 expression was also reduced, but surprisingly this loss was confined to interneurons. Interneuron connectivity was reduced in tandem with IGF-1 deficiencies. Similar changes were observed in surgically resected neocortex from infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) patients. To evaluate the impact of IGF-1 deficiencies on interneuron development, IGF-1R levels were reduced in the neocortex of neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock out mice by viral injections. Four weeks later, this experimental maneuver resulted in similar reductions in interneuron connectivity. Treatment with the IGF-1 derived tripeptide, (1-3)IGF-1, abolished epileptic spasms in most animals, rescued interneuron connectivity, and restored neocortical levels of IGF-1. Our results implicate interneuron IGF-1 deficiencies, possibly impaired autocrine IGF-1 signaling and a resultant interneuron dysmaturation in epileptic spasm generation. By restoring IGF-1 levels, (1-3)IGF-1 likely suppresses spasms by rescuing interneuron connectivity. Results point to (1-3)IGF-1 and its analogues as potential novel disease-modifying therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder.

">Human brain changes after first psilocybin use</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics have robust effects on acute brain function and long-term behavior but whether they also cause enduring functional and anatomical brain changes is unknown. In a placebo-controlled, within-subjects, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging study in 28 healthy, entirely psychedelic-naive participants, anatomical and functional brain changes were detected from one-hour to one-month after a single high-dose (25 mg) of psilocybin. Increases in cognitive flexibility, psychological insight, and well-being were seen at one-month. Diffusion imaging done before and one-month after 25mg psilocybin revealed decreased axial diffusivity bilaterally in prefrontal-subcortical tracts that correlated with decreased brain network modularity over the same time period. Decreased modularity also correlated with improved well-being. Increased cortical signal entropy at 1- and 2-hours post-dosing predicted improved psychological well-being at one-month. Next-day psychological insight mediated the entropy to well-being relationship. All effects were exclusive to 25mg psilocybin; no effects occurred with a 1mg placebo dose.

">Specific Bacterial Taxa and Their Metabolite, DHPS, Linked to Alzheimers Disease, Parkinsons Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are multifactorial disorders frequently associated with gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated bacterial and metabolic dyshomeostasis in the gut microbiome associated with early disease stages across three NDDs, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimers Disease (AD), Parkinsons Disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC) and discovered a previously unrecognized link between a microbial-derived metabolite with an unknown role in human physiology, 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), and NDDs. DHPS was downregulated in AD, ALS, and PD, while Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio, capable of metabolizing this metabolite,1-4 were increased in all disease cohorts. Additionally, select taxa within the Clostridia class had strong negative correlations to DHPS suggesting a potential role in DHPS metabolism. Hydrogen sulfide is a catabolic product of DHPS,1,5 and hydrogen sulfide promotes inflammation,6-8 oxidative stress,9 mitochondrial damage,10 and gut dysbiosis,2,11 known hallmarks of NDD. These findings suggest that cryptic sulfur metabolism via DHPS is a missing link in our current understanding of NDD onset and progression. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide evidence of a conserved gut-brain axis linkage of specific bacterial taxa and their metabolism of DHPS shared by three neurodegenerative diseases.

">Suppression of Visceral Nociception by Selective C-Fiber Transmission Block Using Temporal Interference Sinusoidal Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Chronic visceral pain management remains challenging due to limitations in selective targeting of C-fiber nociceptors. This study investigates temporal interference stimulation (TIS) on dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as a novel approach for selective C-fiber transmission block. We employed (1) GCaMP6 recordings in mouse whole DRG using a flexible, transparent microelectrode array for visualizing L6 DRG neuron activation, (2) ex vivo single-fiber recordings to assess sinusoidal stimulation effects on peripheral nerve axons, (3) in vivo behavioral assessment measuring visceromotor responses (VMR) to colorectal distension in mice, including a TNBS-induced visceral hypersensitivity model, and (4) immunohistological analysis to evaluate immediate immune responses in DRG following TIS. We demonstrated that TIS (2000 Hz and 2020 Hz carrier frequencies) enabled tunable activation of L6 DRG neurons, with the focal region adjustable by altering stimulation amplitude ratios. Low-frequency (20-50 Hz) sinusoidal stimulation effectively blocked C-fiber and A{delta}-fiber transmission while sparing fast-conducting A-fibers, with 20 Hz showing highest efficacy. TIS of L6 DRG reversibly suppressed VMR to colorectal distension in both control and TNBS-induced visceral hypersensitive mice. The blocking effect was fine-tunable by adjusting interfering stimulus signal amplitude ratios. No apparent immediate immune responses were observed in DRG following hours-long TIS. In conclusion, TIS on lumbosacral DRG demonstrates promise as a selective, tunable approach for managing chronic visceral pain by effectively blocking C-fiber transmission. This technique addresses limitations of current neuromodulation methods and offers potential for more targeted relief in chronic visceral pain conditions.

                Herein, we present the 2.0 update of FiNNpy, which expands the toolkit's initial scope from the analysis of multi-site electrophysiological activity to track information propagation to include source reconstruction capability for MEG signals. Following the toolkit's design guidelines, the new functionality has been optimized towards minimal resource consumption, making source reconstruction much faster, especially when executed in a parallelized fashion. Furthermore, several quality-of-life aspects are introduced to support source reconstruction, such as grouping source-space activity into cortical areas, a cohesive documentation & in-code extensive literature references, and wrapping of previously terminal exclusive functions of FreeSurfer.

	<p>Background: There is considerable evidence supporting the elevated risk of mental health problems in individuals with evening chronotype relative to those with morning or intermediate chronotypes. Recent data, however, suggest that this risk may be explained, at least partially, by poor sleep quality. Methods: This study aimed to further clarify the roles of chronotype and sleep quality in mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress) in young individuals (18&amp;amp;ndash;40 years) living in the UK (n = 185) or Germany (n = 209). Results: Consistent with our recent observations in a comparable North Indian sample, we found that poor quality of sleep had significantly positive associations with adverse mental health outcomes both in the UK and Germany-based samples. Significant associations between evening chronotype and poor mental health were also evident, but these associations were fully mediated by poor quality of sleep in both samples. Conclusions: These observations suggest that efforts to identify sleep disruption in a timely manner and promotion of good sleep may prevent mental health problems, especially in individuals with evening chronotype and other known risks for mental disorders.</p>

">X-ray Diffraction Reveals Periodicity in Murine Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: The perineuronal net (PNN) is a form of extracellular matrix which develops as a lattice like structure around neuronal somas, proximal dendrites and synapses. In homeostasis, it supports synaptic stability, protects neurons, and helps regulate inhibition/excitation. In pathology, it has been described as degraded or even absent. Sensory deprivation has been shown to alter PNN structures. New Methods: Here, we measured the X-ray diffraction patterns of mouse brain tissue to establish a novel method for examining nanoscale brain structures. Two groups of mice were examined, a control group, and one which underwent 30 days (P0-P30) of whisker-trimming - an established method of sensory deprivation, affecting the mouse barrel cortex (whisker sensory processing region of somatosensory cortex). Mice were perfused, and primary somatosensory cortices (barrel cortex) were isolated for x-ray diffraction imaging. Results: X-ray images were characterized using a specially developed machine-learning approach, and the clusters that correspond to the two groups are well separated in the space of the principal components. Conclusions: We hypothesize that such separation is related to the development of nanoscale structural components within PNNs of control mice and the absence of such structures in sensory deprived mice.

">A biophysically-detailed model of inter-areal interactions in cortical sensory processing</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms of top-down modulation in sensory perception and their relation to underlying connectivity are not completely understood. We present here a biophysically-detailed computational model of two interconnected cortical areas, representing the first steps in a cortical processing hierarchy, as a tool for potential discovery. The model integrates a large body of data from rodent primary somatosensory cortex and reproduces biological features across multiple scales: from a handful of ion channels defining a diversity of electrical types in hundreds of thousands of morphologically detailed neurons, to local and long-range networks mediated by hundreds of millions of synapses. Notably, long-range connectivity in the model incorporates target lamination patterns associated with feed-forward and feedback pathways. We use the model to study the impact of inter-areal interactions on sensory processing. First, we exhibit a cortico-cortical loop between the two model areas (X and Y), wherein sensory input to area X produces a response with two components in time, the first driven by the stimulus and the second by feedback from area Y. We perform a structural and functional characterization of this loop, finding a differential impact of layer-specific pathways in the feed-forward and feedback directions. Second, we explore stimulus discrimination by presenting four different spatially-segregate stimulus patterns. We observe well-defined temporal sequences of functional cell assembly activation, with stimulus specificity in early but not late assemblies in area X, i.e., in the stimulus-driven component of the response but not in the feedback-driven component. We also find the earliest assembly in area Y to be specific to pairs of patterns, consistent with the topography of connections. Finally, we examine the integration of bottom-up and top-down signals. When presenting a second stimulus coincident with the feedback-driven component, we observe an approximate linear superposition of responses. We find the implied lack of interaction consistent with the naive connectivity in the model and the absence of plasticity mechanisms that would underlie the learning of top-down influences. This work represents a first step in the study of inter-areal interactions with biophysically-detailed simulations.

">Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</a></h4>

              
                A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which encodes a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. By developing a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the model parameters to the characteristics of the evolving signal and, on the other hand, map them to the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases--- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.

">Can we predict sleep health based on brain features? A large-scale machine learning study</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Normal sleep is crucial for brain health. Recent studies have reported robust associations between sleep disturbance and various brain structural and functional traits. However, the complex interplay between sleep health and macro-scale brain organization remains inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to uncover the links between brain imaging features and diverse sleep health-related characteristics by means of Machine Learning (ML). Methods: We used 28,088 participants from the UK Biobank to calculate 4677 structural and functional neuroimaging markers. Then, we employed them to predict self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, easiness getting up in the morning, chronotype, daily nap, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. We built seven different linear and nonlinear ML models for each sleep health-related characteristic to assess their predictability. Results: We performed an extensive ML analysis that involved more than 100,000 hours of computing. We observed relatively low performance in predicting all sleep health-related characteristics (e.g., balanced accuracy ranging between 0.50-0.59). Across all models, the best performance achieved was 0.59, using a Linear SVM to predict easiness getting up in the morning. Conclusions: The low capability of multimodal neuroimaging markers in predicting sleep health-related characteristics, even under extensive ML optimization in a large population sample suggests a complex relationship between sleep health and brain organization.

">Amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and tau aggregated co-pathologies enhance neuropathology and neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Lewy pathology due to alpha-synuclein (-syn) inclusions is one of the major hallmarks of Parkinson Disease (PD). A{beta}-Amyloid (A{beta}) and phosphorylated tau, pathologies usually found in Alzheimers Disease (AD), have also been implicated in PD, with over 50% of patients exhibited the co-expression of these proteins (co-pathologies). In both AD and PD postmortem tissue, neuroinflammation, the activation of microglia and resident macrophages and the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery, including T cells and monocytes, are drivers of neurodegeneration. However, how the co-expression of these pathologies contribute to the inflammatory response and overall neurodegenerative disease phenotype remains unknown. To understand how the co-expression of pathologies drives neuropathology, we developed a novel co-pathology model by stereotaxically injecting -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum, and AAV-doublemut tau virus into the entorhinal cortex, of 3-month-old J20 transgenic mice with A{beta} pathology. We analyzed immune cell populations in the brain and periphery at 3 months post-induction (3MPI). At 6MPI, neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra pars compacta were assessed along with pathological protein deposition. At 3MPI, the co-pathology mouse model begins to exhibit enhanced pathology load in the cortex and hippocampus. There was a robust neuroinflammatory response in interconnected brain regions, including increased microglial cell number, changes in microglial activation markers, and infiltration of T cells. This was synergistic in the co-pathology model, compared to the individual models, supporting the hypothesis that these collectively may drive the progression of disease.

">Neural mechanisms of adaptive value coding in the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                To address their needs, animals must optimize behavior by integrating external cues with internal state signals, such as hunger or thirst, environmental conditions, and past experiences. Accordingly, the perceived value of a reward varies depending on an animal's current needs. Updating the specific value of rewards predicted by external cues depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, neurophysiological investigations have centered around the assumption of stimulus-invariant value representations and have not been able to account for behavioral findings that support the BLA's ability to represent stimulus-specific value of distinct appetitive or aversive outcomes. To address how the BLA encodes and updates stimulus-specific value representations, we exposed head-fixed mice to distinct sets of gustatory rewards while tracking perceived value using lick microstructural analysis. Two-photon calcium imaging of BLA principal neurons revealed that the magnitude of the BLA population response scaled with perceived reward value and that the values of different rewards were encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations. Moreover, reward representations rapidly re-scaled when mice were exposed to a reward that was larger than all previous rewards. Finally, value representations depended on an animal's internal state as thirst selectively increased the responses to water rewards whereas aversive experiences strongly attenuated responses to sucrose. Our findings demonstrate that value representations in the BLA are stimulus-specific and highly adaptive to account for changes in relative reward value and to reflect an animal's current affective and homeostatic state. This mechanism enables sensory-specific value updates necessary for state-adapted decision making and learning.

">Integration of distinct cortical inputs to primary and higher order inhibitory cells of the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The necortex regulates its own sensory input in part through top-down inhibitory mechanisms. Descending corticothalamic projections drive GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which then control thalamocortical cells via inhibition. Neurons in sensory TRN are organized into primary and higher order (HO) subpopulations, with separate intrathalamic connections and distinct genetic and functional properties. Here, we investigated top-down neocortical control over primary and HO neurons of somatosensory TRN. Projections from layer 6 of somatosensory cortex evoked stronger and more state-dependent activity in primary than in HO TRN, driven by more robust synaptic inputs and potent T-type calcium currents. However, HO TRN received additional, physiologically distinct, inputs from layer 5 of S1 and motor cortex. Thus, in a departure from the canonical focused sensory layer 6 innervation characteristic of primary TRN, HO TRN integrates broadly from multiple corticothalamic systems, with unique state-dependence, extending the range of mechanisms for top-down control.

">Ventral Striatum is Preferentially Correlated with the Salience Network Including Regions in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ventral striatum (VS) receives input from the cerebral cortex and is modulated by midbrain dopaminergic projections in support of processing reward and motivation. Here we explored the organization of cortical regions linked to the human VS using within-individual functional connectivity MRI in intensively scanned participants. In two initial participants (scanned 31 sessions each), seed regions in the VS were preferentially correlated with distributed cortical regions that are part of the Salience (SAL) network. The VS seed region recapitulated SAL network topography in each individual including anterior and posterior midline regions, anterior insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) - a topography that was distinct from a nearby striatal seed region. The region of DLPFC linked to the VS is positioned adjacent to regions associated with domain-flexible cognitive control. The full pattern was replicated in independent data from the same two individuals and generalized to 15 novel participants (scanned 8 or more sessions each). These results suggest that the VS forms a cortico-basal ganglia loop as part of the SAL network. The DLPFC is a neuromodulatory target to treat major depressive disorder. The present results raise the possibility that the DLPFC may be an effective neuromodulatory target because of its preferential coupling to the VS and suggests a path toward further personalization.

">Neocortical differentiation and hippocampal integration of non-meaningful items and their spatial location</a></h4>

              
                Resolving interference between similar inputs is a critical feature of adaptive memory systems. Computational theories of the medial temporal lobe posit that the dentate gyrus and CA3 (CA3DG) subfields of the hippocampus are ideally suited to reduce interference via a process called pattern separation. Whereas neocortical areas upstream of the hippocampus have been shown to play a role in content-specific (e.g., spatial or object-related) interference reduction, the CA3DG is traditionally viewed as a domain-general pattern separator. Recent work also drew attention to the role of frontal and parietal control areas in allocating resources according to task demands during mnemonic discrimination, exerting top-down control over the medial temporal lobe. However, extant evidence in humans is almost solely based on mnemonic discrimination tasks involving everyday items, potentially confounding retrieval processes with pattern separation. Here, we studied pattern separation in a 'process-pure' manner, utilizing non-meaningful fractal images. We acquired full-brain high-resolution functional MRI data of 39 participants (mean age (SD) = 22.6 (2.4) years, 19 females) while they studied fractals with varying degrees of interference in either their spatial or object features. Building upon the idea that the repetition of a stimulus results in a diminished BOLD response in areas involved in the processing of that stimulus (repetition suppression), we expected that regions engaged in pattern separation of objects or locations would decrease their response to repetitions, but not to highly similar (interference-inducing) items. We found that the parahippocampal cortex contributes to interference reduction in the spatial domain, while the perirhinal cortex contributes to interference reduction in the object domain. The frontoparietal control network was recruited during the encoding of both object and location lures, and displayed strengthened within- and cross-network connectivity in response to lures. Contrary to our expectations, the CA3DG showed repetition suppression to both exact repetitions and highly similar lures, indicating a lack of sensitivity to small differences in interfering stimuli. Altogether, these results are in line with content-specific neocortical interference reduction in the medial temporal lobe, possibly orchestrated by the frontoparietal control network, but challenge the view of CA3DG as a universal pattern separator.

">RIPK2 is crucial for the microglial inflammatory response to bacterial muramyl dipeptide but not to lipopolysaccharide</a></h4>

              
                Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is a kinase that plays an essential role in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. As a downstream signaling molecule for nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), NOD2, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), it is implicated in the signaling triggered by recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns by NOD1/2 and TLRs. Upon activation of these innate immune receptors, RIPK2 mediates the release of pro-inflammatory factors by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B). However, whether RIPK2 is essential for downstream inflammatory signaling following the activation of NOD1/2, TLRs, or both remains controversial. In this study, we examined the role of RIPK2 in NOD2- and TLR4-dependent signaling cascades following stimulation of microglial cells with bacterial muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a NOD2 agonist, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist. We utilized a highly specific proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule, GSK3728857A, and found dramatic degradation of RIPK2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, the PROTAC completely abolished MDP-induced increases in iNOS and COX-2 protein levels and pro-inflammatory gene transcription of Nos2, Ptgs2, Il-1{beta}, Tnf, Il6, Ccl2, and Mmp9. However, increases in iNOS and COX-2 proteins and pro-inflammatory gene transcription induced by the TLR4 agonist, LPS, were only slightly attenuated with the GSK3728857A pretreatment. Further findings revealed that the RIPK2 PROTAC completely blocked the phosphorylation and activation of p65 NF-{kappa}B and p38 MAPK induced by MDP, but it had no effects on the phosphorylation of these two mediators triggered by LPS. Collectively, our findings strongly suggest that RIPK2 plays an essential role in the inflammatory responses of microglia to bacterial MDP but not to LPS.

">Peripherally administered TNF inhibitor is not protective against α-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neuronal death in rats</a></h4>

              
                The underlying cause of neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown, but evidence implicates neuroinflammation in PD pathobiology. The pro-inflammatory cytokine soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) seems to play an important role and thus has been proposed as a therapeutic target for modulation of the neuroinflammatory processes in PD. In this regard, dominant-negative TNF (DN-TNF) agents are promising antagonists that selectively inhibit soluble TNF signaling, while preserving the beneficial effects of transmembrane TNF. Previous studies have tested the protective potential of DN-TNF-based therapy in toxin-based PD models. Here we test for the first time the protective potential of a DN-TNF therapeutic against alpha-synuclein-driven neurodegeneration in the viral vector-based PD rat model. To do so, we administered the DN-TNF agent XPro1595 subcutaneously for a period of 12 weeks. In contrast to previous studies using different PD models, neuroprotection was not achieved by systemic XPro1595 treatment. Alpha-synuclein-induced loss of nigrostriatal neurons, accumulation of pathological inclusions and microgliosis was detected in both XPro1595- and saline-treated animals. XPro1595 treatment increased the percentage of the hypertrophic/ameboid Iba1+ cells in SN and reduced the striatal MHCII+ microglia in the striatum of alpha-synuclein-overexpressing animals. However, the treatment did not prevent the MHCII upregulation seen in the SN of the model, nor the increase of CD68+ phagocytic cells. Therefore, despite an apparently positive immune effect, this did not suffice to protect against viral vector-derived alpha-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the therapeutic potential of soluble TNF inhibitors in PD.

">The role of repetition in context-dependent preference</a></h4>

              
                The context in which decisions are learned can influence what choices we prefer in new situations. Such dependencies are well replicated and often lead to decision biases, i.e. choices that deviate from rational choice theory. We propose a simple computational model of such biases. To test the model, we analyzed behavioral data from 351 male and female participants in a series of nine value-based decision tasks and re-analyze six previously published datasets (n = 350 participants). Our results show that the combination of two basic principles, learning by reward, and repetition of decisions, is sufficient to explain biased preferences across all 15 datasets. Using standard analysis and hierarchical Bayesian model comparison we found that the proposed model provides a better explanation than previous accounts. In addition, our results show that higher choice frequency is linked to higher subjective valuation and lower value uncertainty. Results indicate that repetition is an important mechanism in shaping preferences.

">Human BNST volume is not simply sexually dimorphic</a></h4>

              
                "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a sexually dimorphic basal forebrain region", is a claim prevalent across rodent and human neuroscience research, with particular emphasis on its substantially larger size in males. Despite the pervasiveness of this claim, with potential implications for understanding sex differences in anxiety and substance use disorders, inspection of prior literature reveals a complex and nuanced picture. Direct evidence for larger male BNST size in humans comes solely from a handful of mostly small-scale post-mortem studies, which show either no, moderate, or very large differences, therefore indicating the need for a larger systematic investigation. Addressing this, we developed a novel 3T T1-weighted (T1w) manual segmentation protocol of the BNST, which was applied to T1w structural MRI data in 170 young human adults. Using a Bayesian modelling approach, taking into account existing post-mortem data, and controlling for total brain volume, age, and sibship, we find little evidence for total BNST volume differences between males and females. We recommend that researchers exercise caution when reporting evidence of BNST sexual dimorphism, particularly when translating findings from rodent models in which the BNST may play a different, olfaction-focused, role.

">Distinct cortical spatial representations learned along disparate visual pathways</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental studies have discovered diverse spatial properties, such as head direction tuning and egocentric tuning, of neurons in the postrhinal cortex (POR) and revealed how the POR spatial representation is distinct from the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). However, how these spatial properties of POR neurons emerge is unknown, and the cause of distinct cortical spatial representations is also unclear. Here, we build a learning model of POR based on the pathway from the superior colliculus (SC) that has been shown to have motion processing within the visual input. Our designed SC-POR model demonstrates that diverse spatial properties of POR neurons can emerge from a learning process based on visual input that incorporates motion processing. Moreover, combining SC-POR model with our previously proposed V1-RSC model, we show that distinct cortical spatial representations in POR and RSC can be learnt along disparate visual pathways (originating in SC and V1), suggesting that the varying features encoded in different visual pathways contribute to the distinct spatial properties in downstream cortical areas.

">Cerebellar climbing fibers signal flexible, rapidly adapting reward predictions</a></h4>

              
                Classical models of cerebellar computation posit that climbing fibers (CFs) operate according to supervised learning rules, correcting movements by signaling the occurrence of motor errors. However, recent findings suggest that in some behaviors, CF activity can exhibit features that resemble the instructional signals necessary for reinforcement learning, namely reward prediction errors (rPEs). Despite these initial observations, many key properties of reward-related CF responses remain unclear, thus limiting our understanding of how they operate to guide cerebellar learning. Here, we have measured the postsynaptic responses of CFs onto cerebellar Purkinje cells using two-photon calcium imaging to test how they respond to learned stimuli that either do or do not predict reward. We find that CFs can develop generalized responses to similar cues of the same modality, regardless of whether they are reward predictive. However, this generalization depends on temporal context, and does not extend across sensory modalities. Further, learned CF responses are flexible, and can be rapidly updated according to new reward contingencies. Together these results suggest that CFs can generate learned, reward-predictive responses that flexibly adapt to the current environment in a context-sensitive manner.

">Reprogrammed Human Lateral Ganglionic Eminence Precursors Generate Striatal Neurons and Restore Motor Function in a Rat Model of Huntington's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurological disorder predominantly characterised by the progressive loss of GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the striatum resulting in motor dysfunction. One potential strategy for the treatment of HD is the development of cell replacement therapies to restore neuronal circuitry and function by the replacement of lost neurons. We propose the generation of lineage-specific human lateral ganglionic eminence precursors (hiLGEP) using direct reprogramming technology provides a novel and clinically viable cell source for cell replacement therapy for HD. Methods: hiLGEPs were derived by direct reprogramming of adult human dermal fibroblasts (aHDFs) using chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) and a defined reprogramming medium. hiLGEPs were differentiated in vitro using an optimised striatal differentiation medium. Acquisition of a striatal precursor and neural cell fate was assessed through gene expression and immunocytochemical analysis of key markers. hiLGEP-derived striatal neuron functionality in vitro was demonstrated by calcium imaging using Cal-520. To investigate the ability for hiLGEP to survive, differentiate and functionally integrate in vivo, we transplanted hiLGEPs into the striatum of quinolinic acid (QA)-lesioned rats and performed behavioural assessment using the cylinder test over the course of 14 weeks. Survival and differentiation of hiLGEPs was assessed at 8 and 14-weeks post-transplant by immunohistochemical analysis. Results: We demonstrate the capability to generate hiLGEPs from aHDFs using cmRNA encoding the pro-neural genes SOX2 and PAX6, combined with a reprogramming medium containing Go6983, Y-27632, N-2 and Activin A. hiLGEPs generated functional DARPP32+ neurons following 14 days of culture in BrainPhys(TM) media supplemented with dorsomorphin and Activin A. We investigated the ability for hiLGEPs to survive transplantation, differentiate to medium spiny-like striatal neurons and improve motor function in the QA lesion rat model of HD. Fourteen weeks after transplantation, we observed STEM121+ neurons co-expressing MAP2, DARPP32, GAD65/67, or GABA. Rats transplanted with hiLGEPs also demonstrated reduction in motor function impairment as determined by spontaneous exploratory forelimb use when compared to saline transplanted animals. Conclusion: This study provides proof-of-concept and demonstrates for the first time that aHDFs can be directly reprogrammed to hiLGEPs which survive transplantation, undergo neuronal differentiation to generate medium spiny-like striatal neurons, and reduce functional impairment in the QA lesion rat model of HD.

">A multi-omics and cell type-specific characterization of the ventral striatum in human cocaine use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of postmortem brains have revealed initial molecular insights into cocaine use disorder (CUD). However, the inter-relationship between these omics and the contribution of individual cell types remain largely unknown. We present an in-depth analysis of molecular changes in the ventral striatum in CUD at multi-omics and single-cell resolution. Integrative multi-omics analyses of microRNA-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics datasets in 41 individuals and single-nuclei RNA-seq in a subset of 16 individuals revealed conserved deregulation of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and glutamatergic signaling. Cell type-specific analyses identified inverse metabolic pathway deregulation patterns in glial and neuronal cells, notably in astrocytes and medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Characterizing astrocyte-neuron crosstalk revealed altered glutamatergic and cell adhesion signaling in CUD. By applying a comprehensive multi-omics analytical framework, our study provides novel insights into CUD-associated molecular changes in the ventral striatum, suggesting astrocytes, MSNs, and their crosstalk as particularly perturbed in CUD.

">Melanocortin 4 Receptor-Dependent Mechanism of ACTH in Preventing Anxiety-Like Behaviors and Normalizing Astrocyte Proteins After Early Life Seizures</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, affecting millions globally, often leads to significant cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities, particularly in children. Anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent, with roughly a quarter of pediatric epilepsy patients having a comorbid diagnosis. Current treatments inadequately address these issues. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a melanocortin peptide, has shown promise in mitigating cognitive deficits after early life seizures (ELS), potentially through mechanisms beyond its canonical action on melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R). This study explores the hypothesis that recurrent ELS is associated with long-term anxiety, and that treatment with ACTH can prevent this anxiety through a mechanism that involves melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4R) in the brain. Our findings reveal that ACTH ameliorates anxiety-like behavior associated with ELS, without altering seizure parameters, in wildtype (WT) mice but not in MC4R knockout (KO) mice. Our findings also show that knocking-in MC4R in either neurons or astrocytes was able to rescue the anxiety-like behavior after ACTH treatment. Further, our results show that ACTH normalizes important astrocytic proteins like Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) after ELS. This suggests that ACTH beneficial effects on anxiety are mediated through MC4R activation in both neuronal and astrocytic populations. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting MC4R in epilepsy treatment, highlighting its role in mitigating cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behaviors associated with ELS.

                In this study, we characterize the spatial summation properties of targeted magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular pathways within the central 20 degrees of visual field using chromatic transformations in DKL color space. For the magnocellular and koniocellular conditions, critical areas of complete spatial summation were found for all eccentricities. For the parvocellular conditions, complete spatial summation was absent within the stimulus size ranges tested. We also describe an anatomically and physiologically motivated model of receptive field pooling using probability summation. Model simulations suggest that the critical area of summation can be explained by the dendritic field size of underlying retinal ganglion cells, corroborating our psychophysical data.

	<p>(1) Background: This study investigates the resting-state brain characteristics of skeleton athletes compared to healthy age-matched non-athletes, using resting-state fMRI to investigate long-term skeleton-training-related changes in the brain. (2) Methods: Eleven skeleton athletes and twenty-three matched novices with no prior experience with skeleton were recruited. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were explored to investigate resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, aiming to elucidate differences in resting-state brain function between the two groups. (3) Results: Compared to the control group, skeleton athletes exhibited significantly higher ALFF in the left fusiform, left inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left and right insula, left Rolandic operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Skeleton athletes exhibit stronger functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cognitive and motor control (superior frontal gyrus, insula), as well as those related to reward learning (putamen), visual processing (precuneus), spatial cognition (inferior parietal), and emotional processing (amygdala), during resting-state brain function. (4) Conclusions: The study contributes to understanding how motor training history shapes skeleton athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; brains, which have distinct neural characteristics compared to the control population, indicating potential adaptations in brain function related to their specialized training and expertise in the sport.</p>

	<p>Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) among adolescents poses significant risks to academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. This study examines the prevalence and risk factors of EDS in adolescents in Bangladesh and utilizes machine learning approaches to predict the risk of EDS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1496 adolescents using a structured questionnaire. Data were collected through a two-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS. Machine learning models, including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), were employed to identify and predict EDS risk factors using Python and Google Colab. Results: The prevalence of EDS in the cohort was 11.6%. SHAP values from the CatBoost model identified self-rated health status, gender, and depression as the most significant predictors of EDS. Among the models, GBM achieved the highest accuracy (90.15%) and precision (88.81%), while CatBoost had comparable accuracy (89.48%) and the lowest log loss (0.25). ROC-AUC analysis showed that CatBoost and GBM performed robustly in distinguishing between EDS and non-EDS cases, with AUC scores of 0.86. Both models demonstrated the superior predictive performance for EDS compared to others. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the role of health and demographic factors in predicting EDS among adolescents in Bangladesh. Machine learning techniques offer valuable insights into the relative contribution of these factors, and can guide targeted interventions. Future research should include longitudinal and interventional studies in diverse settings to improve generalizability and develop effective strategies for managing EDS among adolescents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-203/v2?src=rss">Effectiveness of a multidimensional collaborative approach versus usual care in the treatment of adult depression in primary care in Chile: study protocol for a single blinded cluster randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Background Major depression (MD) is a prevalent and disabling condition in Chile, with most cases being treated at the primary care level. In Chilean primary care, the authors have identified key factors associated with more complex presentations of MD and a poorer prognosis, such as a history of childhood trauma, suicidality, and comorbidities. These findings underscore the need for a multidimensional, trauma-informed, and interprofessional approach to the treatment of depression. Methods This protocol is a two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT to compare the effectiveness of a collaborative multidimensional approach for depression (CMAD) versus usual care to treat MD in primary care clinics in Chile. In total, 394 depressed adults from 18 to 65 years of age in twelve clinics located in Chile’s Maule Region will be consented to participate in the study. Patients and care teams from each clinic will be randomized to the intervention or to the control arm. Interprofessional teams in the intervention arm will attend 27 hours of didactic and active learning sessions focused on clinical competences to effectively engage, treat and follow up patients with the factors associated to the complex presentation of MD. Team in the control arm will receive 27 didactic sessions on current clinical guidelines for MD. Patients of both arms will be blindly assessed at baseline, three months, and six months. The primary outcome will be the reduction in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes including improvements in anxiety symptoms, interpersonal and social functioning, and treatment adherence. Discussion This protocol proposes the evaluation of an intervention designed to improve depression symptoms by enhancing the clinical competencies of primary care teams. These competencies are structured around collaborative care and trauma-informed practices. Trial registration NCT05016388, registered on 16 August 2021 at ClinicalTrials.gov.

                Background Maternal mortality is the main indicator of maternal health worldwide. The aims of your study were to determine the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in the governorate of Tunis and to identify the main causes of maternal death. Methods We included all maternal deaths between January 2017 and December 2023, reported to the Tunis Regional Health Directorate. The data collected included the MMR per 100000 live birth, sociodemographic characteristics, causes of death, circumstances of death, autopsy findings, and preventability. Results Sixty one maternal deaths were recorded. The average of MMR was 46, 88 per 100000 live births. Two peaks in the MMR were noted in 2017 and 2020. The average age of the patients was 34, 1 years (±5.1). We noted that 43, 75 % of the patients were not residents of the governorate of Tunis. The postpartum period was the most critical. In fact, 83, 33 % of maternal deaths occurred postpartum. Hemorrhage was the main etiology in 20.8% of cases. The second cause was COVID- 19complicationsin 16, 6% of cases. Conclusion This study of maternal mortality in Tunis opens the debate on the effectiveness of maternal health policies in Tunisia and the areas for improvement.

                Background Rehabilitation programs help to improve people’s lives and reduce turnover rates in organisations. The current analysis revealed that dissatisfaction occurred among practitioners, doctors’ overlapping services, and fragmented plans. No comprehensive assessment and rehabilitation program currently exists for stress-related disorders in Estonia indicating an urgent need to conduct research and development programs for clients to reduce stress (Bugarski, Z, et al., 2016). This study research aimed to determine the usefulness of rehabilitation programs for individuals people with stress-related disorders. Method A qualitative approach was used. Methodology The sample included 10 individuals recruited from various rehabilitation centers in Estonia. Convenience sampling was used to select participants for this research. Open- and closed-ended questions were formulated using the 12 questions enclosed in this research. All transcribed interviews were formatted using the code. Extract codes within participant interviews were compared to identify similarities, differences, and closeness, and therefore formulated categories. Results The findings revealed that rehabilitation programs contribute to quality services, self-motivation, daily activities plan, self-control, recovery, attention and concentration, and coping skills, whereas traditional treatment can reduce symptoms but not change people’s lives. Conclusion This study suggests that rehabilitation programs are useful for individuals with stress disorders in the context of the Estonian healthcare system. The rehabilitation program is a useful intervention method revealed in the context of Estonia’s healthcare system, as it improves quality services, increases coping skills, self-control, and cognitive skills, and enhances recovery.

                Eosinophilia serves as an indicator of allergy and parasite infestation. Eosinophil granules are believed to have adverse effects on cells and contribute to oxidative stress. In our current study, we investigated the relationship between eosinophilia and healthy subjects in terms of nuclear DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes. The comet assay was employed to test whole blood samples from 52 subjects in each group. The results revealed that eosinophilia subjects exhibited significantly higher levels of nuclear DNA damage in leukocytes compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, a weak positive association was observed between eosinophil counts and DNA damage. Our findings suggest that eosinophilia is linked to systemic oxidative DNA damage.

                Background Tunisia was one of the most affected nations with COVID-19 disease. The clinical features of this illness range from asymptomatic illness to death. Aim To analyse the survival of patients admitted to a Tunisian tertiary care center (Sahloul University Hospital) and identify independent predictive factors for hospital COVID-19 mortality. Methods A longitudinal study was conducted among confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Sahloul University Hospital between September 2020 and September 2022. Cox univariate regression was used to calculate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of death for patient characteristics regarding the time at risk. Risk factors with a p value of 0.2 or less in the univariate analysis were initially included in the multivariate Cox regression models. Results During the study at Sahloul Hospital, 1978 patients were hospitalized, averaging 55.65 years in age (± 21.39). Among them, 417 deaths occurred, with a median survival of 30 days (± 3.11) [23.904-36.096]. Factors significantly affecting the survival curve were: Age, male gender, comorbidities, diabetes, hypertension, endocrine diseases, obesity, intubation, and ICU admission Multilevel survival analyses revealed that hypertension (aHR 1.24; CI [1.02-1.52]; p=0.028), ICU admission (aHR 12.20- CI [9.56-15.57]; p<10-3), and male gender (HR 1.19; CI [0.98-1.46]; p=0.076) were independent factors associated with COVID-19 mortality. Conclusion Our study concluded the importance of the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients to decrease this virus mortality. A good understanding of the possible clinical factors associated with COVID-19 severity is helpful for clinicians in identifying patients who are at high risk and require prioritized treatment to minimize death.

                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Design A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study. Setting Tertiary care hospital of Udupi district Karnataka. Population or Sample Women delivered in tertiary care Hospital of Udupi district, Karnataka, were the sample; among them, the cases (250) were the records of the women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were the records of women who delivered after 37 weeks of gestation and without any complications. Method The study was conducted using a retrospective case-control design by reviewing the case records of women who had delivered in a tertiary care hospital. Main Outcome Measures Women delivered in tertiary care Hospital of Udupi district, Karnataka, and their inpatient records were assessed for risk factors during the antenatal and delivery periods. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) Out of 2402 deliveries. Among them, only 250 were assessed. It was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravid para, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women who had been exposed or had a risk for preterm labor included those who had been diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, medication during pregnancy, history of abortion, intense physical labor, and conception dates older than 30 years. Conclusion The preterm labor prevalence can be minimized if the modifiable risk factors are in control. Non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Thus, health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

                Background Molecular hybridization in drug design is proved to be very successful approach to provide new chemical entities with potential activities and desirable physicochemical properties. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in controlling the behavior and acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins and their inhibition causes block of cell growth, differentiation, changes in gene expression, and death. Consequently, HDAC inhibitors may lead to anticytotoxic activity. An approach of synthesizing hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid via an amino acid or aminoalkanoic acid was considered. This approach is expected to optimize the anticytotoxic activity of the proposed compounds. Methods Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid (2A-E) were synthesized and their chemical structures were confirmed by spectral analyses (FT-IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR). These were subjected to molecular docking on HDAC8 (PDB ID: 1T69). Computational methods were employed using the SwissADME server to predict the ADME parameters and other physicochemical properties. The cytotoxicity evaluation was performed using MTT colorimetric assay. Results Hybrids (2A-E) recorded lower ΔG (-6.322 to - 9.46) than Vorinostat (SAHA, -5.375). ΔG is an affinity scoring function (kcal/mol) and is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and Van der Waals energies. Benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid by a p-aminobenzoic acid (2E) has recorded the lowest docking score of -9.460 and this may refer to the possibility of high inhibitory activity. The hybrids showed no violation from Lipinski’s rule and complied with parameters with low possible passive oral absorption and no penetration into BBB. Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole recorded very interesting results, particularly, 2D and 2E which showed significant and remarkable activity. Conclusions Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid recorded very interesting results, particularly, compounds 2D and 2E which showed significant and remarkable activity on lung cancer cell line type A549.

                Background: Considering the importance of exploring the development of reasoning skills during preschool period and the suitability of using a culturally linguistically relevant story-based approach for the same, the present research intended to profile the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children between 36 and 72 months using a story-based approach. The specific objectives were to develop explanation, prediction, and inference based reasoning tasks around a story and assess the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children using the same. Method: Reasoning tasks across explanation, prediction, and inference domains were developed based on a story and evaluated for its psychometric properties. The developed tasks were then administered to 63 typically developing Indian preschool children attending English medium schools in Mangalore. The preschoolers were equally divided into three age groups, and the responses obtained across the age groups were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: The developed tasks were confirmed to have good psychometric properties like content validity and reliability. The age comparisons of reasoning abilities using one-way ANOVA suggested an increase in reasoning abilities with age during the preschool period. The qualitative analysis further suggested that with increasing age, the nature of reasoning changed from content-based reasoning to reasoning based on prior knowledge which was integrated with the story content. Conclusion: The study describes reasoning skill development using a story-based task in Indian preschoolers. The study findings further provide clinical and educational implications to assess and foster reasoning abilities among preschoolers.

                Background Academic achievement is the result of both effort and perseverance exerted by the students. This mixed-methods study aims to investigate the factors affecting the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

                Background Good care and conscious, mindful parenting are the essential requirements of the early childhood period. Good care in early childhood consists of mindful handling of children’s needs like hunger, care in sickness, socio-emotional needs, safety, love and affection. Good care promotes children’s development and provides a favourable environment for learning. It’s a well-known fact that hospitalization is a stressful situation for child of any age. Play is an integral part of early childhood period which is virtually restricted in hospital settings. This study will try to explore the effectiveness of play therapy delivered in hospital settings, on early child development. Methods This will be a randomized control trial conducted in the Paediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital in Wardha, India. The sample size will be 360 children, 180 each in intervention and control arm. The hospitalized children from intervention arm will receive customized Play Therapy sessions from trained research assistants and will be followed up at scheduled home visits for one year from the date of enrolment. All children will be assessed for changes in cognitive, motor and socio-emotional development scores. The differences in development scores between intervention and control groups will be compared and effect sizes of changes will be calculated. Discussion Implementation of play stimulation activities have been reported as useful strategies for promoting child development and good recovery during hospitalization. This trial will attempt to explore the effectiveness of play therapy on changes in child development scores of children from intervention group compared to the control group. The customized play therapy program will be adapted to paediatric inpatient settings, and attempts will be made to improve the Play Therapy kit for hospitalized children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1211/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Delayed Diagnosis of Leprosy-Related Neuropathic Ulcer, Insights from a Case of Delay to Diagnose across Four Clinical Settings [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. This case report underscores the importance of timely recognition and a better understanding of Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers to prevent misdiagnosis and improve patient outcomes. Methods The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic, Griya Afiat, Makassar, East Indonesia. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Sheet (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Results Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test—initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. Conclusions This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.

                <p>by Jessica L. Gaines, Kwang S. Kim, Ben Parrell, Vikram Ramanarayanan, Alvincé L. Pongos, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, John F. Houde</p>

Behavioral speech tasks have been widely used to understand the mechanisms of speech motor control in typical speakers as well as in various clinical populations. However, determining which neural functions differ between typical speakers and clinical populations based on behavioral data alone is difficult because multiple mechanisms may lead to the same behavioral differences. For example, individuals with cerebellar ataxia (CA) produce atypically large compensatory responses to pitch perturbations in their auditory feedback, compared to typical speakers, but this pattern could have many explanations. Here, computational modeling techniques were used to address this challenge. Bayesian inference was used to fit a state feedback control (SFC) model of voice fundamental frequency (<i>fo</i>) control to the behavioral pitch perturbation responses of speakers with CA and typical speakers. This fitting process resulted in estimates of posterior likelihood distributions for five model parameters (sensory feedback delays, absolute and relative levels of auditory and somatosensory feedback noise, and controller gain), which were compared between the two groups. Results suggest that the speakers with CA may proportionally weight auditory and somatosensory feedback differently from typical speakers. Specifically, the CA group showed a greater relative sensitivity to auditory feedback than the control group. There were also large group differences in the controller gain parameter, suggesting increased motor output responses to target errors in the CA group. These modeling results generate hypotheses about how CA may affect the speech motor system, which could help guide future empirical investigations in CA. This study also demonstrates the overall proof-of-principle of using this Bayesian inference approach to understand behavioral speech data in terms of interpretable parameters of speech motor control models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1210/v1?src=rss">Unleashing the cardioprotective potential of Ezetimibe against Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in Wistar rats: Targeting oxidative stress and NF-κB-mediated inflammation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antineoplastic agent used in treating various adult and pediatric cancers, but it tends to provoke dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Ezetimibe (EZE), a cholesterol-lowering drug, has been reported to possess defensive actions against oxidative stress and inflammation, which are two of the main proposed mechanisms underlying the development of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), hence, we aimed to inspect the possible protective effect of EZE against DIC in rats. Methods 24 adult male Wistar rats were allocated into four groups of six: control, DOX, 10 mg/kg EZE plus DOX and 20 mg/kg EZE plus DOX. At the end of the study, the experimental rats were anesthetized and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, after which the hearts were excised and heart tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and gene expression analyses. Results Pretreatment with EZE at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg alleviated cardiac damage induced by DOX, as EZE blunted the rise in serum levels of cardiac injury biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Additionally, pretreating rats with EZE at either dose mitigated DOX-induced oxidative stress by elevating the levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), with consequent reduction in the lipid peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) in cardiac tissues. Furthermore, pretreatment with either dose of EZE hindered DOX-mediated inflammation, where EZE suppressed cardiac nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and negatively regulated the gene expression of its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) with either dose and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) with the higher one. Conclusions Our findings indicate that EZE exhibited cardioprotection against DIC in rats, which makes EZE an interesting area for further investigations, animal- and human-wise, that can pave the way for a potential clinical application in preventing DIC in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-486/v2?src=rss">Reliability, validity, and minimal clinically important differences for the Thai-version of the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ-Thai) in patients with chronic venous disease [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential for assessing the health of patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to translate the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire into Thai language (AVVQ-Thai) and evaluate its reliability and validity. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the AVVQ-Thai also be estimated. Methods International standards for PROM translation were followed including the forward-backwards translation of the AVVQ. Patients with Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) C2-C6 with truncal reflux were prospectively included. Venous interventions were used to treat reflux and varicosities. Patients’ characteristics, venous clinical severity scores (VCSS), EuroQol EQ-5D, and AVVQ-Thai were collected pre- and one-month post-intervention. AVVQ-Thai was also collected one to two weeks after the initial visit by reply-paid postal questionnaire. Results The study included 119 patients (30% C2, 29% C3, 28% C4, 11% C5, and 2% C6). The AVVQ-Thai had good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.783 and moderate reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.79). The AVVQ-Thai was significantly correlated with VCSS and was able to discriminate patients with different levels of health problems as assessed by EQ-5D at both pre-and post-intervention, demonstrating good construct and discriminative validity. The median AVVQ scores improved significantly after intervention from 15.4 (IQR 8.3, 24.2) to 4.2 (IQR 1.3, 8.4) in C2-C3, and 18.9 (IQR 14.1, 25.5) to 7.3 (IQR 4.6, 16.3) in C4-C6. The MCID of the AVVQ was 6.21 on the 0-100 scale, which equates to the level of difference necessary to be clinically meaningful. Conclusions AVVQ-Thai has satisfactory evidence for internal consistency, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change and is recommended for application in Thailand.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>The study aimed to compare outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in pediatric patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) versus cardioembolism (CE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Save ChildS and KidClot cohorts were merged. Children with AIS because of FCA or CE that underwent MT were included. The study used the Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) for stroke cause assessment. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to analyze final modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scores, periprocedural complications, and functional outcomes assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 to 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 60 children with 14 FCA and 46 CE cases. CE etiology was associated with better revascularization (good to excellent thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores) and shift toward better outcomes (common adjusted odds ratio of mRs for CE vs FCA: 0.27, 95% CI: [0.06–0.97], <i>p</i> = 0.039), with no difference in favorable outcome rates. FCA was associated with significantly lower rates of excellent revascularization (21% vs 65%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No difference in complications' rates was observed between the groups (7.2% in FCA vs 5.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.69).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found that pediatric AIS because of CE etiology has more favorable procedural outcomes compared to FCA following MT. This translated to mixed functional outcomes that may be more favorable in the CE group. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine treatment protocols for pediatric stroke, particularly in understanding and managing FCA in children.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathological studies suggest that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions endure multiple waves of damage and repair; however, the dynamics and characteristics of these processes are poorly understood in patients living with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 128 MS patients (75 relapsing–remitting, 53 progressive) and 72 healthy controls who underwent advanced magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination at baseline and 2 years later. Magnetization transfer saturation and multi-shell diffusion imaging were used to quantify longitudinal changes in myelin and axon volumes within MS lesions. Lesions were grouped into 4 classes (repair, damage, mixed repair damage, and stable). The frequency of each class was correlated to clinical measures, demographic characteristics, and levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stable lesions were the most frequent (<i>n</i> = 2,276; 44%), followed by lesions with patterns of “repair” (<i>n</i> = 1,352; 26.2%) and damage (<i>n</i> = 1,214; 23.5%). The frequency of “repair” lesion was negatively associated with disability (β = −0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and sNfL (β = −0.16; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at follow-up. The frequency of the “damage” class was higher in progressive than relapsing–remitting patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and was related to disability (baseline: β = −0.078; follow-up: β = −0.076; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and age (baseline: β = −0.078; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Stable lesions were more frequent in relapsing–remitting than in progressive patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and in younger patients versus older (β = −0.07; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline. Further, “mixed” lesions were most frequent in older patients (β = 0.004; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings show that repair and damage processes within MS lesions occur across the entire disease spectrum and that their frequency correlates with patients disability, age, disease duration, and extent of neuroaxonal damage. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentless, fatal neurodegenerative disease. The progressive loss of voluntary muscle function, diagnostic delays, lack of effective treatments, and challenges accessing multidisciplinary care and resources have tremendous impact on quality of life.

                Neutrophil cationic proteins (NCPs) have antibacterial, pro-inflammatory, and tissue repair properties. Vandenberghe-Dürr et al. show that OLFM4, a negatively charged granule molecule, disrupts NCP functions, impairing bacterial clearance and skin wound repair. Inhibiting OLFM4 therefore represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to accelerate skin wound closure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96738">Regulatory genome annotation of 33 insect species</a></h4>

              
                Annotation of newly sequenced genomes frequently includes genes, but rarely covers important non-coding genomic features such as the <i>cis</i>-regulatory modules—e.g., enhancers and silencers—that regulate gene expression. Here, we begin to remedy this situation by developing a workflow for rapid initial annotation of insect regulatory sequences, and provide a searchable database resource with enhancer predictions for 33 genomes. Using our previously developed SCRMshaw computational enhancer prediction method, we predict over 2.8 million regulatory sequences along with the tissues where they are expected to be active, in a set of insect species ranging over 360 million years of evolution. Extensive analysis and validation of the data provides several lines of evidence suggesting that we achieve a high true-positive rate for enhancer prediction. One, we show that our predictions target specific loci, rather than random genomic locations. Two, we predict enhancers in orthologous loci across a diverged set of species to a significantly higher degree than random expectation would allow. Three, we demonstrate that our predictions are highly enriched for regions of accessible chromatin. Four, we achieve a validation rate in excess of 70% using in vivo reporter gene assays. As we continue to annotate both new tissues and new species, our regulatory annotation resource will provide a rich source of data for the research community and will have utility for both small-scale (single gene, single species) and large-scale (many genes, many species) studies of gene regulation. In particular, the ability to search for functionally related regulatory elements in orthologous loci should greatly facilitate studies of enhancer evolution even among distantly related species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97602">Cell class-specific long-range axonal projections of neurons in mouse whisker-related somatosensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                Long-range axonal projections of diverse classes of neocortical excitatory neurons likely contribute to brain-wide interactions processing sensory, cognitive and motor signals. Here, we performed light-sheet imaging of fluorescently labeled axons from genetically defined neurons located in posterior primary somatosensory barrel cortex and supplemental somatosensory cortex. We used convolutional networks to segment axon-containing voxels and quantified their distribution within the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework. Axonal density was analyzed for different classes of glutamatergic neurons using transgenic mouse lines selectively expressing Cre recombinase in layer 2/3 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Rasgrf2-dCre), layer 4 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Scnn1a-Cre), layer 5 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Tlx3-Cre), layer 5 pyramidal tract projection neurons (Sim1-Cre), layer 5 projection neurons (Rbp4-Cre), and layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (Ntsr1-Cre). We found distinct axonal projections from the different neuronal classes to many downstream brain areas, which were largely similar for primary and supplementary somatosensory cortices. Functional connectivity maps obtained from optogenetic activation of sensory cortex and wide-field imaging revealed topographically organized evoked activity in frontal cortex with neurons located more laterally in somatosensory cortex signaling to more anteriorly located regions in motor cortex, consistent with the anatomical projections. The current methodology therefore appears to quantify brain-wide axonal innervation patterns supporting brain-wide signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92915">Heterozygous expression of a Kcnt1 gain-of-function variant has differential effects on somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing cortical GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                More than 20 recurrent missense gain-of-function (GOF) mutations have been identified in the sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) channel gene <i>KCNT1</i> in patients with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), most of which are resistant to current therapies. Defining the neuron types most vulnerable to KCNT1 GOF will advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide refined targets for precision therapy efforts. Here, we assessed the effects of heterozygous expression of a <i>Kcnt1</i> GOF variant (<i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup>) on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in mice, including those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV), to identify and model the pathogenic mechanisms of autosomal dominant <i>KCNT1</i> GOF variants in DEEs. Although the <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant had no effects on glutamatergic or VIP neuron function, it increased subthreshold K<sub>Na</sub> currents in both SST and PV neurons but with opposite effects on neuronal output; SST neurons became hypoexcitable with a higher rheobase current and lower action potential (AP) firing frequency, whereas PV neurons became hyperexcitable with a lower rheobase current and higher AP firing frequency. Further neurophysiological and computational modeling experiments showed that the differential effects of the <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant on SST and PV neurons are not likely due to inherent differences in these neuron types, but to an increased persistent sodium current in PV, but not SST, neurons. The <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant also increased excitatory input onto, and chemical and electrical synaptic connectivity between, SST neurons. Together, these data suggest differential pathogenic mechanisms, both direct and compensatory, contribute to disease phenotypes, and provide a salient example of how a pathogenic ion channel variant can cause opposite functional effects in closely related neuron subtypes due to interactions with other ionic conductances.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85042">Cell-cell interaction determines cell fate of mesoderm-derived cell in tongue development through Hh signaling</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of primary cilia leads to genetic disorder, ciliopathies, which shows various malformations in many vital organs such as brain. Multiple tongue deformities including cleft, hamartoma, and ankyloglossia are also seen in ciliopathies, which yield difficulties in fundamental functions such as mastication and vocalization. Here, we found these tongue anomalies in mice with mutation of ciliary protein. Abnormal cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCC) failed to evoke Hh signal for differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into myoblasts, which resulted in abnormal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into adipocytes. The ectopic adipose subsequently arrested tongue swelling formation. Ankyloglossia was caused by aberrant cell migration due to lack of non-canonical Wnt signaling. In addition to ciliopathies, these tongue anomalies are often observed as non-familial condition in human. We found that these tongue deformities could be reproduced in wild-type mice by simple mechanical manipulations to disturb cellular processes which were disrupted in mutant mice. Our results provide hints for possible future treatment in ciliopathies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96224">Systematic evaluation of multifactorial causal associations for Alzheimer’s disease and an interactive platform MRAD developed based on Mendelian randomization analysis</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex degenerative disease of the central nervous system, and elucidating its pathogenesis remains challenging. In this study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD (<a href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</a>) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance our understanding of the etiology of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94001">Transcriptional inhibition after irradiation occurs preferentially at highly expressed genes in a manner dependent on cell cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                In response to DNA double-strand damage, ongoing transcription is inhibited to facilitate accurate DNA repair while transcriptional recovery occurs after DNA repair is complete. However, the mechanisms at play and the identity of the transcripts being regulated in this manner are unclear. In contrast to the situation following UV damage, we found that transcriptional recovery after ionizing radiation (IR) occurs in a manner independent of the HIRA histone chaperone. Sequencing of the nascent transcripts identified a programmed transcriptional response, where certain transcripts and pathways are rapidly downregulated after IR, while other transcripts and pathways are upregulated. Specifically, most of the loss of nascent transcripts occurring after IR is due to inhibition of transcriptional initiation of the highly transcribed histone genes and the rDNA. To identify factors responsible for transcriptional inhibition after IR in an unbiased manner, we performed a whole genome gRNA library CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Many of the top hits on our screen were factors required for protein neddylation. However, at short times after inhibition of neddylation, transcriptional inhibition still occurred after IR, even though neddylation was effectively inhibited. Persistent inhibition of neddylation blocked transcriptional inhibition after IR, and it also leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we uncovered that many inhibitors and conditions that lead to cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase also prevent transcriptional inhibition after IR. As such, it appears that transcriptional inhibition after IR occurs preferentially at highly expressed genes in cycling cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99026">Genome-wide mapping of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells</a></h4>

              
                The interplay between G4s and R-loops are emerging in regulating DNA repair, replication, and transcription. A comprehensive picture of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells is currently lacking. Here, we describe the development of HepG4-seq and an optimized HBD-seq methods, which robustly capture native G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells. We successfully employed these methods to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We discovered that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent manner and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. We further demonstrated the helicase Dhx9 as a direct and major regulator that modulates the formation and resolution of co-localized G4s and R-loops. Depletion of Dhx9 impaired the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes. Taken together, our work established that the endogenous co-localized G4s and R-loops are prevalently persisted in the regulatory regions of active genes and are involved in the transcriptional regulation of their linked genes, opening the door for exploring broader roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.

                <p>Autonoetic consciousness (ANC), the ability to re-experience personal past events links episodic memory and self-consciousness by bridging awareness of oneself in a past event (i.e., during its encoding) with awareness of oneself in the present (i.e., during the reliving of a past event). Recent neuroscience research revealed a bodily form of self-consciousness, including the sense of agency (SoA) and the sense of body ownership (SoO) that are based on the integration of multisensory bodily inputs and motor signals. However, the relation between SoA and/or SoO with ANC is not known. Here, we used immersive virtual reality technology and motion tracking and investigated the potential association of SoA/SoO with ANC. For this, we exposed participants to different levels of visuomotor and perspectival congruency, known to modulate SoA and SoO, during the encoding of virtual scenes and collected ANC ratings 1 week after the encoding session. In a total of 74 healthy participants, we successfully induced systematic changes in SoA and SoO during encoding and found that ANC depended on the level of SoA experienced during encoding. Moreover, ANC was positively associated with SoA, but only for the scene encoded with preserved visuomotor and perspectival congruency, and such SoA&ndash;ANC coupling was absent for SoO and control questions. Collectively, these data provide behavioral evidence in a novel paradigm that links a key subjective component of bodily self-consciousness during encoding, SoA, to the subjective reliving of those encoded events from one's past, ANC.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0314-24.2024?rss=1">Role of the Nucleus Accumbens in Signaled Avoidance Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals, humans included, navigate their environments guided by sensory cues, responding adaptively to potential dangers and rewards. Avoidance behaviors serve as adaptive strategies in the face of signaled threats, but the neural mechanisms orchestrating these behaviors remain elusive. Current circuit models of avoidance behaviors indicate that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum plays a key role in signaled avoidance behaviors, but the nature of this engagement is unclear. Evolving perspectives propose the NAc as a pivotal hub for action selection, integrating cognitive and affective information to heighten the efficiency of both appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors. To unravel the engagement of the NAc during active and passive avoidance, we used calcium imaging fiber photometry to examine NAc GABAergic neuron activity in <I>ad libitum</I> moving mice performing avoidance behaviors. We then probed the functional significance of NAc neurons using optogenetics and genetically targeted or electrolytic lesions. We found that NAc neurons code contraversive orienting movements and avoidance actions. However, direct optogenetic inhibition or lesions of NAc neurons did not impair active or passive avoidance behaviors, challenging the notion of their purported pivotal role in adaptive avoidance. The findings emphasize that while the NAc encodes avoidance movements, it is not required for avoidance behaviors, highlighting the distinction between behavior encoding or representation and mediation or generation.</p>

                Introduction In recent years, the number of cardiac surgeries has been on the rise. Several predictive models have been developed to assess the risk of mortality for these patients. EuroSCORE II, a widely used model, demonstrates good discrimination and calibration for the European population, but its accuracy may vary in the Indonesian population. The purpose of this study was to develop a scoring model tailored to Indonesian population, which may have better accuracy in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among adult cardiac surgery patients. Method A retrospective study was conducted using medical records of adult cardiac surgery patients from four participating hospitals. Potential risk factors were included as variables and analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with the L-backward method. Bootstrapping was applied to enhance the model’s validity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for each model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess discrimination ability, while the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate calibration. Results We extracted data from 4,875 patients, with a mean age of 50.41 years, and most patients were men (63.1%). The majority of patients were in NYHA class I-II. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.5%. From 62 potential variables, 13 variables were included in the final model. Our new model demonstrated strong discrimination and calibration (AUC 0.7564; Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.9510). Conclusion The newly developed scoring model exhibited good discrimination and calibration, making it a promising tool for predicting in-hospital mortality in adult cardiac surgery patients in Indonesia.

                Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the need for resilient health systems. However, Ghana does not seem to achieve commensurate results, suggesting potential gaps in critical interventions. This study examines these gaps by drawing on global experiences to guide Ghana's preparedness for future emergencies. Methods A scoping review based on the synthesis of published journal articles and grey literature was used to gather relevant evidence to address the study’s objective. Peer-reviewed literature searches were conducted in databases, including Medline, Scopus, and Health Sources, supplemented by searches on organizational websites to identify grey literature. We adopted the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) framework to explore how health systems responded to the COVID-19 pandemic globally and draw lessons for strengthening Ghana's health system resilience. We analyzed policy responses in three main areas: pandemic preparedness, crisis management, and response and recovery. Results Ten strategies emerged from the study as critical in strengthening health system resilience against future pandemics. These strategies include whole-of-government engagement, financing for preparedness, community engagement and trust, robust surveillance systems, emergency medical care, diverse workforce development, digital health integration, critical health infrastructure, well-planned commodities/products, and social capital. Each strategy plays a vital role in enhancing preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, highlighting the multifaceted approach needed to mitigate the impact of future pandemics on health systems. Conclusions The identified strategies align with the attributes of a resilient healthcare system. By adopting these strategies, Ghana can build a resilient healthcare system that effectively addresses future challenges, guided by global insights and experiences.

                Background Various studies across different settings have validated Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) as a valuable outcome for clinical research in surgery and other fields. However, there is no clear consensus on the definitions and methods used to handle and report DAOH in perioperative care studies. Objective We aim to identify, describe, and summarize the available research on DAOH to understand how it is being conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care. Methods We will conduct a scoping review to analyze and synthesize the existing studies using DAOH to measure clinical results on perioperative care. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and CENTRAL. Screening, eligibility, inclusion and data extraction processes will be performed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer solving disagreements. We will present our results descriptively. Conclusions We expect to provide a comprehensive overview of how DAOH is conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care, with particular attention to methodological approaches and the role of electronic health-care records (EHRs) among the different regions.

The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction inhibition, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. By utilizing a fully data-driven method, this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain.

                <p>by Marta Sampaio, Miguel Rocha, Oscar Dias</p>

<i>Vitis vinifera</i>, also known as grapevine, is widely cultivated and commercialized, particularly to produce wine. As wine quality is directly linked to fruit quality, studying grapevine metabolism is important to understand the processes underlying grape composition. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have been used for the study of plant metabolism and advances have been made, allowing the integration of omics datasets with GSMMs. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has been used to analyze and integrate omics data, and while the combination of ML with GSMMs has shown promising results, it is still scarcely used to study plants. Here, the first GSSM of <i>V</i>. <i>vinifera</i> was reconstructed and validated, comprising 7199 genes, 5399 reactions, and 5141 metabolites across 8 compartments. Tissue-specific models for the stem, leaf, and berry of the Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar were generated from the original model, through the integration of RNA-Seq data. These models have been merged into diel multi-tissue models to study the interactions between tissues at light and dark phases. The potential of combining ML with GSMMs was explored by using ML to analyze the fluxomics data generated by green and mature grape GSMMs and provide insights regarding the metabolism of grapes at different developmental stages. Therefore, the models developed in this work are useful tools to explore different aspects of grapevine metabolism and understand the factors influencing grape quality.

                <p>by George Gabriel, Faisal Mushtaq, J. Ryan Morehead</p>

From tying one’s shoelaces to driving a car, complex skills involving the coordination of multiple muscles are common in everyday life; yet relatively little is known about how these skills are learned. Recent studies have shown that new sensorimotor skills involving re-mapping familiar body movements to unfamiliar outputs cannot be learned by adjusting pre-existing controllers, and that new task-specific controllers must instead be learned “de novo”. To date, however, few studies have investigated de novo learning in scenarios requiring continuous and coordinated control of relatively unpractised body movements. In this study, we used a myoelectric interface to investigate how a novel controller is learned when the task involves an unpractised combination of relatively untrained continuous muscle contractions. Over five sessions on five consecutive days, participants learned to trace a series of trajectories using a computer cursor controlled by the activation of two muscles. The timing of the generated cursor trajectory and its shape relative to the target improved for conditions trained with post-trial visual feedback. Improvements in timing transferred to all untrained conditions, but improvements in shape transferred less robustly to untrained conditions requiring the trained order of muscle activation. All muscle outputs in the final session could already be generated during the first session, suggesting that participants learned the new task by improving the selection of existing motor commands. These results suggest that the novel controllers acquired during de novo learning can, in some circumstances, be constructed from components of existing controllers.

                <p>by Alexis Bénichou, Jean-Baptiste Masson, Christian L. Vestergaard</p>

Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred to as “building blocks of complex networks”. Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enable the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. Here, we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which allows us to compare different motifs and select the collectively most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. Our approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on <i>a priori</i> specification of an appropriate null model. It thus overcomes common problems in hypothesis testing-based motif analysis and guarantees robust statistical inference. We validate our methodology on numerical data and then apply it on synaptic-resolution biological neural networks, as a medium for comparative connectomics, by evaluating their respective compressibility and characterize their inferred circuit motifs.

                <p>by Colby Fronk, Jaewoong Yun, Prashant Singh, Linda Petzold</p>

Symbolic regression with polynomial neural networks and polynomial neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are two recent and powerful approaches for equation recovery of many science and engineering problems. However, these methods provide point estimates for the model parameters and are currently unable to accommodate noisy data. We address this challenge by developing and validating the following Bayesian inference methods: the Laplace approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, and variational inference. We have found the Laplace approximation to be the best method for this class of problems. Our work can be easily extended to the broader class of symbolic neural networks to which the polynomial neural network belongs.

                <p>by Amanda Craine, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Christopher T. Villongco, Kevin Vincent, David E. Krummen, Sanjiv M. Narayan, Roy C. P. Kerckhoffs, Jeffrey H. Omens, Francisco Contijoch, Andrew D. McCulloch</p>

In patients with dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF), cardiac conduction abnormalities cause the regional distribution of myocardial work to be non-homogeneous. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using an implantable, programmed biventricular pacemaker/defibrillator, can improve the synchrony of contraction between the right and left ventricles in DHF, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality and increased quality of life. Since regional work depends on wall stress, which cannot be measured in patients, we used computational methods to investigate regional work distributions and their changes after CRT. We used three-dimensional multi-scale patient-specific computational models parameterized by anatomic, functional, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological measurements in eight patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who received CRT. To increase clinical translatability, we also explored whether streamlined computational methods provide accurate estimates of regional myocardial work.
We found that CRT increased global myocardial work efficiency with significant improvements in non-responders. Reverse ventricular remodeling after CRT was greatest in patients with the highest heterogeneity of regional work at baseline, however the efficacy of CRT was not related to the decrease in overall work heterogeneity or to the reduction in late-activated regions of high myocardial work. Rather, decreases in early-activated regions of myocardium performing negative myocardial work following CRT best explained patient variations in reverse remodeling. These findings were also observed when regional myocardial work was estimated using ventricular pressure as a surrogate for myocardial stress and changes in endocardial surface area as a surrogate for strain. These new findings suggest that CRT promotes reverse ventricular remodeling in human dyssynchronous heart failure by increasing regional myocardial work in early-activated regions of the ventricles, where dyssynchrony is specifically associated with hypoperfusion, late systolic stretch, and altered metabolic activity and that measurement of these changes can be performed using streamlined approaches.

<p>Concluding Schema: Taken together with our previous reports, histaminergic neurons originating from the ventral tuberomammillary nucleus (VTM) project to the olfactory bulb (OB) without much branching prior to the OB. Their axons (orange lines) extended to the granule cell layer (GCL), the internal plexiform layer (IPL), the mitral cell layer (MCL), the external plexiform layer (EPL), the glomerular layer (GL), and the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) in the OB. The maximal density of histaminergic axions is observed in the GL, followed by the ONL and GCL. The glomerulus is enlarged to show a schematic diagram for synaptic transmission. The <span class="smallCaps">l</span>-histidine decarboxylase–immunoreactive (HDC-ir) profiles received asymmetrical synapses (red arrows) from olfactory nerves (ON) and indicate synapses (green arrow) containing pleomorphic vesicles with postsynaptic densities to nonolfactory nerve elements (non-ON), thus forming serial synapses. It also receives asymmetric transmission (red arrow) from a profile that appears to be mitral/tufted (M/T) cell.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Odor information is modulated by centrifugal inputs from other brain regions to the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurons containing monoamines, such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, are well known as centrifugal inputs; however, the role of histamine, which is also present in the OB, is not well understood. In this study, we examined the histaminergic neurons projecting from the hypothalamus to the OB. We used an antibody against histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a synthesizing enzyme of histamine, to identify histaminergic neurons and assess their localization within the OB and the ultrastructure of their fibers and synapses using multiple immunostaining laser microscopy, ultra-high voltage electron microscopy (EM), and EM to confirm their relationships with other neurons. To further identify the origin nucleus of the histaminergic neurons projecting to the OB, we injected the retrograde tracer FluoroGold and analyzed the pathway to the OB anterogradely. HDC-immunoreactive (-ir) fibers were abundant in the olfactory nerve (ON) layer compared to other monoamines. HDC-ir neurons received asymmetrical synapses from ONs and formed synapses containing pleomorphic vesicles with variable postsynaptic densities to non-ON elements, thus forming serial synapses. We also confirmed that histaminergic neurons project from the rostral ventral tuberomammillary nucleus to the granule cell layer of the OB and, for the first time, successfully visualized their axons from the hypothalamus to the OB. These findings indicate that histamine may regulate odor discrimination in the OB, suggesting a regulatory relationship between hypothalamic function and olfaction. We thus elucidate morphological mechanisms with tuberomammillary nucleus–derived histaminergic neurons involved in olfactory information.</p>

<p>Expression of dopamine receptors (<i>Drd1</i>, <i>Drd2</i>, <i>Drd3—</i>green) was quantified via RNAScope in HVC, Area X, and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of testosterone treated canaries, along with colocalization of <i>VGlut2</i> (orange), <i>Gad2</i> (red), and <i>Egr1</i> (pink). Illustrated are nuclei studied, dopaminergic projections of PAG, and an example HVC section.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Highly sensitive in situ hybridization procedures (RNAScope) were used to quantify the expression of three dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2, and Drd3) in two song control nuclei (HVC and the Area X of the basal ganglia) that are known to receive dopaminergic inputs and in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of male and female canaries. Both sexes were treated with testosterone to ensure they would sing actively. We also determined the excitatory versus inhibitory phenotype of the cells expressing these receptors as well as their activation following a period of song production. The three receptor types were identified in each brain area, with the exception of Drd3 in Area X. The density of cells expressing each receptor varied as a function of receptor type and brain area. Surprisingly few sex differences were detected; they do not seem to explain the sex differences in testosterone-induced song. Overall, the density of Drd-positive cells was much lower in PAG than in the two song control nuclei. In HVC, the majority of cells expressing the three receptor subtypes were VGlut2-positive, whereas colocalization with Vglut2 occurred in few cells in Area X and in an intermediate proportion of cells in PAG. The number of inhibitory cells expressing dopamine receptors was limited. Most dopaminoceptive cells in Area X did not express either excitatory or inhibitory markers. Finally, cellular activation during singing behavior, as measured by the expression of Egr1, was observed in cells expressing each of the three dopamine receptor subtypes, except Drd3 in the PAG.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27103?af=R">Heightened Reticulospinal Excitability after Severe Corticospinal Damage in Chronic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After severe corticospinal tract damage poststroke in humans, some recovery of strength and movement proximally is evident. It is possible that alternate motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of corticospinal tract input. We investigated the extent of reticulospinal tract excitability modulation and its inter-dependence on the severity of corticospinal tract damage after stroke in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel startle conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm to elicit ipsilateral motor evoked potentials, an index of reticulospinal tract excitability, in 22 chronic stroke participants with mild to severe corticospinal tract damage and 14 neurotypical age-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was higher in the paretic arm of people with severe corticospinal tract damage compared to their non-paretic arm, people with mild corticospinal tract damage, and age-matched controls. Interestingly, ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was correlated with motor impairment across the entire stroke cohort, whereby individuals with worse impairment exhibited more frequent ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (ie, higher reticulospinal tract excitability).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Following severe corticospinal tract damage, upregulated reticulospinal tract activity may compensate for a loss of corticospinal tract input, providing some proximal recovery of isolated and within-synergy movements, but deficits in performing out of synergy movements and finger fractionation remain. Interventions aimed at modulating the reticulospinal tract could be beneficial or detrimental to ameliorating motor impairment depending on the degree of reliance on this pathway for residual motor output.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1035/v2?src=rss">Role of Artificial intelligence model in prediction of low back pain using T2 weighted MRI of Lumbar spine [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Low back pain (LBP), the primary cause of disability, is the most common musculoskeletal disorder globally and the primary cause of disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are inconclusive and less sensitive for identifying and classifying patients with LBP. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the prediction of LBP using T2 weighted MRI image of the lumbar spine. Methods This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200 MRI patients (100 cases and controls each) referred for lumbar spine and whole spine screening were included. The scans were performed using 3.0 Tesla MRI (United Imaging Healthcare). T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine were segmented to extract radiomic features. Machine learning (ML) models, such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, adaboost, and deep learning methods (DL), such as ResNet and GoogleNet, were used, and performance measures were calculated. Results Our study showed that Random forest and AdaBoost are the most reliable ML models for predicting LBP. Random forest showed high performance with area under curve (AUC) values from 0.83 to 0.88 across all lumbar vertebrae and L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral discs (IVDs), with AUCs of 0.88 the highest at L5-S1 IVD (0.92). Adaboost demonstrated high performance at the L2-L5 vertebrae with AUC values of 0.82 to 0.90, with the highest AUC (0.97) at the L5-S1 IVD. Among the DL models, GoogleNet outperformed the other models at 30 epochs with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by ResNet 18 (30 epochs) with an accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion The study demonstrated that ML and DL models can effectively predict LBP from MRI T2 weighted image of the lumbar spine. ML and DL models could also enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LBP, potentially leading to better patient management and outcomes.

                In Japanese language education, the term "learning environment" is used in various contexts. This paper investigates the term "learning environment" in previous studies and notes that traditional learning environments have been characterized as "morphological characteristics learning environments" focusing on static learners. However, since learning environments involve a dynamic, reciprocal relationship where learners and their surroundings interact and evolve, the paper advocates for a re-conceptualization of "experiential-ecological learning environments" that captures this dynamic nature. Furthermore, to enrich the experiential-ecological learning environment for learners, the presence of learning environment engineers and the meaningful valuing of environmental enrichments is essential. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that by combining various individual learning experiences, it is possible to create a sustainable and richer learning environment.

                Across species, navigation is crucial for finding both resources and shelter. In vertebrates, the hippocampus supports memory-guided goal-directed navigation, whereas in arthropods the central complex supports similar functions. A growing literature is revealing similarities and differences in the organization and function of these brain regions. We review current knowledge about how each structure supports goal-directed navigation by building internal representations of the position or orientation of an animal in space, and of the location or direction of potential goals. We describe input pathways to each structure – medial and lateral entorhinal cortex in vertebrates, and columnar and tangential neurons in insects – that primarily encode spatial and non-spatial information, respectively. Finally, we highlight similarities and differences in spatial encoding across clades and suggest experimental approaches to compare coding principles and behavioral capabilities across species. Such a comparative approach can provide new insights into the neural basis of spatial navigation and neural computation.

                Zhukovskaya et al. show that during social defeat, stress-susceptible mice have higher initial activity in LHb. Closed-loop LHb activation during defeat produces lasting behavioral and neural substrates of susceptibility. These results highlight the importance of activity levels in the LHb during the stress experience in determining stress outcomes.

                Wong et al. show that the serotonergic neurons of C. elegans secrete exosomes at the onset of the dauer stage. These exosomes contain miRNAs that are preloaded onto Argonaute proteins, which translocate to the germline. After their internalization, the miRNAs silence germline mRNA targets to preserve germ cell integrity.

                Chen et al. sorted diverse human antibody libraries against various multiple polyreactivity reagents, revealing that heavy-chain variable regions primarily mediate non-specificity. In addition, a machine learning model was developed to predict human antibody polyreactivity, revealing key features relevant to antibody recognition and drug design.
