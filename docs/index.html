              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of human superior colliculus in affective experiences during visual and somatosensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The superior colliculus is often studied for its role in visually guided behaviors, but research in non-human animals indicates it is a midbrain hub for processing sensory information from multiple domains, including interoception (which is associated with affect). We used ultra-high field 7-Tesla fMRI to extend this work to humans, modeling superior colliculus BOLD signal intensity during visual or somatosensory stimulation (N = 40 in each sensory modality), both under aversive and neutral affective intensity. As hypothesized, the superior colliculus showed increased BOLD signal intensity in the dorsal and ventral subregions during visual and somatosensory stimulation, respectively. The entire superior colliculus also showed increased BOLD signal intensity during aversive compared to neural conditions. The superior colliculus BOLD signal intensity also correlated with a preregistered set of brain regions involved in visual, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing.

                AD is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple daily tasks. AD typically progresses over decades through multiple stages (Figure 1). First, at the preclinical (asymptomatic) stage, patients have no cognitive symptoms. However, at this stage, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of Tau proteins, and physiological alterations in neurons have already begun in focal regions of the brain, and worsen gradually over ~20 years [1–4].

	<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is complex, multilayered, and not fully understood, resulting in a lack of effective disease-modifying treatments for this prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Symptoms of PD are heterogenous, including motor impairment as well as non-motor symptoms such as depression, cognitive impairment, and circadian disruption. Aging and stress are important risk factors for PD, leading us to explore pathways that may either accelerate or protect against cellular aging and the detrimental effects of stress. Cortisol is a much-studied hormone that can disrupt mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which are recognized as key underlying disease mechanisms in PD. The more recently discovered klotho protein, considered a general aging-suppressor, has a similarly wide range of actions but in the opposite direction to cortisol: promoting mitochondrial function while reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Both hormones also converge on pathways of vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance, also implicated to play a role in PD. Interestingly, aging, stress and PD associate with an increase in cortisol and decrease in klotho, while physical exercise and certain genetic variations lead to a decrease in cortisol response and increased klotho. Here, we review the interrelated opposite actions of cortisol and klotho in the pathogenesis of PD. Together they impact powerful and divergent mechanisms that may go on to influence PD-related symptoms. Better understanding of these hormones in PD would facilitate the design of effective interventions that can simultaneously impact the multiple systems involved in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>

	<p>In GWAS studies, the neural adhesion molecule encoding the neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) gene has been consistently linked with both depression and obesity. Although the linkage between NEGR1 and depression is the strongest, evidence also suggests the involvement of NEGR1 in a wide spectrum of psychiatric conditions. Here we show the expression of NEGR1 both in tyrosine- and tryptophan hydroxylase-positive cells. Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice show a time-dependent increase in behavioral sensitization to amphetamine associated with increased dopamine release in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Upregulation of transcripts encoding dopamine and serotonin transporters and higher levels of several monoamines and their metabolites was evident in distinct brain areas of Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice. Chronic (23 days) escitalopram-induced reduction of serotonin and dopamine turnover is enhanced in Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice, and escitalopram rescued reduced weight of hippocampi in Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice. The current study is the first to show alterations in the brain monoaminergic systems in Negr1-deficient mice, suggesting that monoaminergic neural circuits contribute to both depressive and obesity-related phenotypes linked to the human NEGR1 gene.</p>

	<p>Background: Hand dysfunction is one of the main symptoms of stroke patients, but there is still a lack of accurate hand function assessment systems. This study focused on the application of the multi-dimensional intelligent visual quantitative assessment system (MDIVQAS) in the rehabilitation assessment of hand function in stroke patients and evaluate hand function rehabilitation in stroke patients. Methods: Eighty-two patients with stroke and unilateral hand dysfunction were evaluated by MDIVQAS. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha coefficient was used to assess the internal consistency of MDIVQAS; the F-test is used to assess the differences in MDIVQAS for multiple repeated measures. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s analysis was used to identify correlations of MDIVQAS with other assessment systems. T-tests were used to identify differences in outcomes assessed with MDIVQAS in patients before and after treatment. p&amp;amp;lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results: (1) Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha coefficient of MDIVQAS in evaluating hand&amp;amp;rsquo;s function &amp;amp;gt;0.9. (2) There was no significant difference between the other repeated measurements, except for thumb rotation in MDIVQAS. (3) MDIVQAS had a significant correlation with other assessment systems (r &amp;amp;gt; 0.5, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). (4) There were significant differences in the evaluation of hand function in patients before and after treatment using MDIVQAS. Conclusion: The MDIVQAS system has good reliability and validity in the evaluation of stroke hand function, and it can also better evaluate the treatment effect.</p>

	<p>Palliative care adds significant burdens to healthcare workers. In neuropalliative care (NPC), additional challenges include patient symptom burdens, such as impairments in mobility, cognition, and communication. After one year of operating the first NPC ward in Germany, we assessed burdens, resources, and the number of deaths perceived as stressful. NPC physicians and nursing staff were compared with the team of other neurological wards, including a stroke unit. The assessment took place between March 2022 and May 2022. All 64 team members were contacted; the responder rate was 81%. The perceived burden was high but did not differ between groups. There were no differences between the NPC- and the neurological wards in the number of deaths perceived as stressful. However, rather than the number of deaths, the circumstances of dying influence the perceived distress. The resources mentioned were similar between groups, with the team and private life being most important. Communication difficulties were frequently cited as stressful, whereas successful communication was identified as a resource.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Forebrain Glucocorticoid Receptor Overexpression Alters Behavioral Encoding of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Cells in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Glucocorticoid signaling influences hippocampal-dependent behavior and vulnerability to stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. In mice, lifelong overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in forebrain excitatory neurons altered exploratory behavior, cognition, and dorsal hippocampal gene expression in adulthood, but whether GR overexpression alters the information encoded by hippocampal neurons is not known. We performed <I>in vivo</I> microendoscopic calcium imaging of 1359 dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells in freely behaving male and female wild-type (WT) and GR-overexpressing (GRov) mice during exploration of a novel open field, where most CA1 neurons are expected to respond to center location and mobility. Most neurons showed sensitivity to center location and/or mobility based on single-neuron calcium amplitude and event rate, but these sensitivity patterns differed between genotypes. GRov neurons were more likely than WT neurons to display center sensitivity and less likely to display mobility sensitivity. More than one-third of these responsive GRov neurons were sensitive only to center location and not mobility, while uniquely center-sensitive neurons were rare in WT. Most center-sensitive neurons exhibited anticipatory activity, suggesting they could drive behavior. We conclude that, compared with wild-type, dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells in GRov mice preferentially respond to center location rather than mobility in a novel open field. Such changes in the information encoded by individual hippocampal neurons in an aversive environment could underlie changes in stress vulnerability because of genetic or epigenetic variations in glucocorticoid receptor signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Pyramidal and Parvalbumin Cells Exhibit Distinct Spatiotemporal Extracellular Electric Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain circuits are composed of diverse cell types with distinct morphologies, connections, and distributions of ion channels. Modeling suggests that the spatial distribution of the extracellular voltage during a spike depends on cellular morphology, connectivity, and identity. However, experimental evidence from the intact brain is lacking. Here, we combined high-density recordings from hippocampal region CA1 and neocortex of freely moving mice with optogenetic tagging of parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV) cells. We used ground truth tagging of the recorded pyramidal cells (PYR) and PV cells to construct binary classification models. Features derived from single-channel waveforms or from spike timing alone allowed near-perfect classification of PYR and PV cells. To determine whether there is unique information in the spatial distribution of the extracellular potentials, we removed all single-channel waveform information from the multichannel waveforms using an event-based delta-transformation. We found that spatiotemporal features derived from the transformed waveforms yield accurate classification. The extracellular analog of the spatial distribution of the initial depolarization phase provided the highest contribution to the spatially based prediction. Compared with PV cell spikes, PYR spikes exhibited higher spatial synchrony at the beginning of the extracellular spike and lower synchrony at the trough. The successful classification of PYR and PV cells based on purely spatial features provides direct experimental evidence that spikes of distinct cell types are associated with distinct spatial distributions of extracellular potentials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Generic Inhibitory Function of Corollary Discharge in Motor Intention: Evidence from the Modulation Effects of Speech Preparation on the Late Components of Auditory Neural Responses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The importance of action&ndash;perception loops necessitates efficient computations linking motor and sensory systems. Corollary discharge (CD), a concept in motor-to-sensory transformation, has been proposed to predict the sensory consequences of actions for efficient motor and cognitive control. The predictive computation has been assumed to realize via inhibiting sensory reafference when actions are executed. Continuous control throughout the course of action demands inhibitory function ubiquitously on all potential reafference when sensory consequences are not available before execution. However, the temporal and functional characteristics of CD are unclear. When does CD begin to operate? To what extent does CD inhibit sensory processes? How is the inhibitory function implemented in neural computation? Using a delayed articulation paradigm with three types of auditory probes (speech, nonspeech, and nonhuman sounds) in an electroencephalography experiment with 20 human participants (7 males), we found that preparing to speak without knowing what to say (general preparation) suppressed neural responses to each type of auditory probe, suggesting a generic inhibitory function of CD in motor intention. Moreover, power and phase coherence in low-frequency bands (1&ndash;8 Hz) were both suppressed, indicating that inhibition was mediated by dampening response amplitude and adding temporal variance to sensory processes. Furthermore, inhibition was stronger for sounds that humans can produce than nonhuman sounds, hinting that the generic inhibitory function of CD is regulated by the established motor&ndash;sensory associations. These results suggest a functional and temporal granularity of corollary discharge that mediates multifaceted computations in motor and cognitive control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-exposure to azithromycin enhances gonococcal resilience to subsequent ciprofloxacin exposure: an in vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The effect of sequential exposure to different antibiotics is an underexplored topic. Azithromycin can be detected in humans for up to 28 days post-ingestion and may prime bacterial responses to subsequently ingested antibiotics. Methods: In this in vitro study, we assessed if preexposure to azithromycin could accelerate the acquisition of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Neisseria gonorrhoeae reference strain, WHO–F. In a morbidostat, we set two conditions in 3 vials each: mono-exposure (preexposure to Gonococcal Broth followed by exposure to ciprofloxacin) and dual sequential exposure (preexposure to azithromycin followed by exposure to ciprofloxacin).The growth of the cultures was measured by a software (MATLAB). The program decided if gonococcal broth or antibiotics were added to the vials in order to keep the evolution of the cultures. Samples were taken twice a week until the end of the experiment i.e. until resistance was achieved or cellular death. Additionally, six replicates of WHO–F WT and WHO–F with rplV mutation, caused by azithromycin, were exposed to increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin in plates to assess if there were differences in the rate of resistance emergence. Results: We found that after 12 hours of pre-exposure to azithromycin, N. gonorrhoeae's resilience to ciprofloxacin exposure increased. Pre-exposure to azithromycin did not, however, accelerate the speed to acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusions:  We found that azithromycin does not accelerate the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance, but there were differences in the molecular pathways to the acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance: the strains preexpossed to azithromycin followed a different route (GyrA: S91F pathway) than the ones without antibiotic preexposure (GyrA:D95N pathway). However, the number of isolates is too small to draw such strong conclusions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Bidirectional regulation by “star forces”: Ionotropic astrocyte's optical stimulation suppresses synaptic plasticity, metabotropic one strikes back</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The role of astrocytes in modulating synaptic plasticity is an important question that until recently was not addressed due to limitations of previously existing technology. In the present study, we took an advantage of optogenetics to specifically activate astrocytes in hippocampal slices in order to study effects on synaptic function. Using the AAV-based delivery strategy, we expressed the ionotropic channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or the metabotropic Gq-coupled Opto-a1AR opsins specifically in hippocampal astrocytes to compare different modalities of astrocyte activation. In electrophysiological experiments, we observed a depression of basal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 hippocampal layer following light stimulation of astrocytic ChR2. The ChR2-mediated depression increased under simultaneous light and electrical theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Application of the type 2 purinergic receptor antagonist suramin prevented depression of basal synaptic transmission, and switched the ChR2-dependent depression into potentiation. The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist, phaclofen, did not prevent the depression of basal fEPSPs, but switched the ChR2-dependent depression into potentiation comparable to the values for TBS in control slices. In contrast, light stimulation of Opto-a1AR expressed in astrocytes led to an increase in basal fEPSPs, as well as a potentiation of synaptic responses to TBS significantly. A specific blocker of the Gq protein downstream target, the phospholipase C, U73122, completely prevented the effects of Opto-a1AR stimulation on basal fEPSPs or Opto + TBS responses. To understand molecular basis for the observed effects, we performed an analysis of gene expression in these slices using quantitative PCR approach. We observed a significant upregulation of “immediate-early” gene expression in hippocampal slices after light activation of Opto-a1AR-expressing astrocytes alone (<i>cRel</i>, <i>Arc</i>, <i>Fos</i>, <i>JunB</i>, and <i>Egr1</i>) or paired with TBS (<i>cRel</i>, <i>Fos</i>, and <i>Egr1</i>). Activation of ChR2-expressing hippocampal astrocytes was insufficient to affect expression of these genes in our experimental conditions. Thus, we concluded that optostimulation of astrocytes with ChR2 and Opto-a1AR optogenetic tools enables bidirectional modulation of synaptic plasticity and gene expression in hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Breast Milk Exposure is Associated With Cortical Maturation in Preterm Infants</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Breast milk exposure is associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes following preterm birth but the neural substrates linking breast milk with outcome are uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that high versus low breast milk exposure in preterm infants results in cortical morphology that more closely resembles that of term-born infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 135 preterm (&lt;32 weeks’ gestation) and 77 term infants. Feeding data were collected from birth until hospital discharge and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at term-equivalent age. Cortical indices (volume, thickness, surface area, gyrification index, sulcal depth, and curvature) and diffusion parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], radial diffusivity [RD], axial diffusivity [AD], neurite density index [NDI], and orientation dispersion index [ODI]) were compared between preterm infants who received exclusive breast milk for &lt;75% of inpatient days, preterm infants who received exclusive breast milk for ≥75% of inpatient days and term-born controls. To investigate a dose response effect, we performed linear regression using breast milk exposure quartile weighted by propensity scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In preterm infants, high breast milk exposure was associated with reduced cortical gray matter volume (<i>d</i> = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14 to 0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.014), thickness (<i>d</i> = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.84, <i>p</i> = 0.039), and RD (<i>d</i> = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.002 to 0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.039), and increased FA (<i>d</i> = −0.38, 95% CI = −0.74 to −0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.037) after adjustment for age at MRI, which was similar to the cortical phenotype observed in term-born controls. Breast milk exposure quartile was associated with cortical volume (ß = −0.192, 95% CI = −0.342 to −0.042, <i>p</i> = 0.017), FA (ß = 0.223, 95% CI = 0.075 to 0.372, <i>p</i> = 0.007), and RD (ß = −0.225, 95% CI = −0.373 to −0.076, <i>p</i> = 0.007) following adjustment for age at birth, age at MRI, and weighted by propensity scores, suggesting a dose effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High breast milk exposure following preterm birth is associated with a cortical imaging phenotype that more closely resembles the brain morphology of term-born infants and effects appear to be dose-dependent. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Author(s): Mahmoud Abdelgalil, Yasser Aboelkassem, and Haithem Taha</p><p>When searching for an egg, sea urchin sperm typically switch between two distinct navigation modes, depending on the relative orientation of their velocity with respect to the chemical gradient of the attractant released from the egg. This paper demonstrates that this navigational strategy can be described by the control algorithm known as extremum seeking. There is no need to define a threshold mechanism to explain the switching behavior, as suggested by previous work.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayesian Multi-View Clustering given complex inter-view structure [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Multi-view datasets are becoming increasingly prevalent. These datasets consist of different modalities that provide complementary characterizations of the same underlying system. They can include heterogeneous types of information with complex relationships, varying degrees of missingness, and assorted sample sizes, as is often the case in multi-omic biological studies. Clustering multi-view data allows us to leverage different modalities to infer underlying systematic structure, but most existing approaches are limited to contexts in which entities are the same across views or have clear one-to-one relationships across data types with a common sample size. Many methods also make strong assumptions about the similarities of clusterings across views. We propose a Bayesian multi-view clustering approach (BMVC) which can handle the realities of multi-view datasets that often have complex relationships and diverse structure. BMVC incorporates known and complex many-to-many relationships between entities via a probabilistic graphical model that enables the joint inference of clusterings specific to each view, but where each view informs the others. Additionally, BMVC estimates the strength of the relationships between each pair of views, thus moderating the degree to which it imposes dependence constraints. We benchmarked BMVC on simulated data to show that it accurately estimates varying degrees of inter-view dependence when inter-view relationships are not limited to one-to-one correspondence. Next, we demonstrated its ability to capture visually interpretable inter-view structure in a public health survey of individuals and households in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Finally, we showed that BMVC clusters integrate the complex relationships between multi-omic profiles of breast cancer patient data, improving the biological homogeneity of clusters and elucidating hypotheses for functional biological mechanisms. We found that BMVC leverages complex inter-view structure to produce higher quality clusters than those generated by standard approaches. We also showed that BMVC is a valuable tool for real-world discovery and hypothesis generation.

                Background: Motivation has long been seen as a deciding factor in the learning of a foreign language and in ensuring success for the learners. As a corollary to this, demotivation adversely affects learning success and negatively influences learning outcomes. The present study examines the factors that negatively affect Saudi EFL learners.   Methods: The study subjects are 45 male and 35 female learners, and the data were collected using a 50-item questionnaire. The factors under study are course instructor, course-content and facilities, attitude towards EFL and socio-cultural factors.  Data have been analyzed using the SPSS software.   Results: Results show that the factors around socio-cultural, and course instructor (M=4.06, 3.67) respectively were the most influential in aggravating the student's demotivation. Furthermore, experience of failure is at play as a moderate factor (M=2.84) whereas the course content and facilities and attitude towards EFL factors, (M=2.57; M=1.83) are perceived as less influential factors in demotivating the EFL students. Findings also show a marginal non-significant difference between male and female participants regarding perceptions of the demotivating factors (males = 5.30, females= 5.70); the difference is not significant, P=, .834.   Conclusions: It is presumed that the findings of this study might be helpful for EFL learners and instructors of Saudi Arabia in devising coping strategies to overcome demotivation.

                Background: Anaerobic organisms have been known to have an association with dental infections, bacteremia, endocarditis and soft tissue infections. However, anaerobic isolation from bone and joint infections are relatively rare. Sparse literature has been found on reports of anaerobic osteomyelitis. There is no literature reported on anaerobic osteomyelitis complicating Tuberculosis of spine. Case Report: We report two cases of tuberculosis of spine complicated by aerobic and anerobic infections. The first is a case of a young female who presented with chronic lower backache and fever. Examination revealed a lumbar scoliosis with paraspinal tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed lumbar spondylodiscitis with multiple abscesses. There were air-fluid levels noted in the abscesses. The pus sent for CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test) was positive. Further the cultures also grew Escherichia coli (aerobic) Bacteroids fragilis and Peptoniphilus asachrolyticus (anaerobic) organisms. She improved with a course of intravenous antibiotics and decompression surgery. The second case is a middle aged man who presented with chronic neck pain and fever. Examination revealed kyphosis of the neck with spasm of the neck muscles and midline tenderness. MRI showed C4-5 cervical spondylodiscitis with parapharyngeal collections showing air-fluid levels. The pus culture showed Streptococcus constellatus (aerobic) and  Prevotella sps. (anaerobic). The CBNAAT report was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and cervical decompression. Conclusion: Though tubercular vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) is usually a diagnosis in itself, it should not hinder us from considering secondary infections (both aerobic and anaerobic) complicating the osteomyelitis. Further, the presence of air-fluid levels on imaging studies and the presence of foul smell during operative exploration of the spine must arouse the suspicion of an anaerobic co-infection. Isolation and treatment of these organisms are crucial as they may hamper the clinical outcome of the primary TVO.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and invasive primary brain tumor. Current therapies are not curative, and patients' outcomes remain poor with an overall survival of 20.9 months after surgery. The typical growing pattern of GBM develops by infiltrating the surrounding apparent normal brain tissue within which the recurrence is expected to appear in the majority of cases. Thus, in the last decades, an increased interest has developed to investigate the cellular and molecular interactions between GBM and the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) bordering the tumor tissue. The aim of this review is to provide up-to-date knowledge about the oncogenic properties of the PBZ to highlight possible druggable targets for more effective treatment of GBM by limiting the formation of recurrence, which is almost inevitable in the majority of patients. Starting from the description of the cellular components, passing through the illustration of the molecular profiles, we finally focused on more clinical aspects, represented by imaging and radiological details. The complete picture that emerges from this review could provide new input for future investigations aimed at identifying new effective strategies to eradicate this still incurable tumor.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding functional correlations between the activities of neuron populations is vital for the analysis of neuronal networks. Analyzing large-scale neuroimaging data obtained from hundreds of neurons simultaneously poses significant visualization challenges. We developed V-NeuroStack, a novel network visualization tool to visualize data obtained using calcium imaging of spontaneous activity of neurons in a mouse brain slice as well as in vivo using two-photon imaging. V-NeuroStack creates 3D time stacks by stacking 2D time frames for a time-series dataset. It provides a web interface to explore and analyze data using both 3D and 2D visualization techniques. Previous attempts to analyze such data have been limited by the tools available to visualize large numbers of correlated activity traces. V-NeuroStack's 3D view is used to explore patterns in dynamic large-scale correlations between neurons over time. The 2D view is used to examine any timestep of interest in greater detail. Furthermore, a dual-line graph provides the ability to explore the raw and first-derivative values of activity from an individual or a functional cluster of neurons. V-NeuroStack can scale to datasets with at least a few thousand temporal snapshots. It can potentially support future advancements in in vitro and in vivo data capturing techniques to bring forth novel hypotheses by allowing unambiguous visualization of massive patterns in neuronal activity data.</p>

<p>This study illustrates a significant antagonistic interaction between tobacco use disorder (TUD) and weight status in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and a quadratic effect of body mass index on DLPFC gray matter volume. These results possibly provide hints into future treatment for the special population of comorbid TUD and overweight.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tobacco smoking and overweight lead to adverse health effects, which remain an important public health problem worldwide. Researches indicate overlapping pathophysiology may contribute to tobacco use disorder (TUD) and overweight, but the neurobiological interaction mechanism between the two factors is still unclear. This study used a mixed sample design, including the following four groups: (i) overweight long-term smokers (<i>n</i> = 24, age = 31.80 ± 5.70, cigarettes/day = 20.50 ± 7.89); (ii) normal weight smokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.29 ± 5.56, cigarettes/day = 16.11 ± 8.35); (iii) overweight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 19, age = 33.05 ± 5.60), and (iv) normal weight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.68 ± 6.57), a total of 99 male subjects. All subjects underwent T1-weighted high-resolution MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to compare gray matter volume (GMV) among the four groups. Then, JuSpace toolbox was used for cross-modal correlations of MRI-based modalities with nuclear imaging derived estimates, to examine specific neurotransmitter system changes underlying the two factors. Our results illustrate a significant antagonistic interaction between TUD and weight status in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and a quadratic effect of BMI on DLPFC GMV. For main effect of TUD, long-term smokers were associated with greater GMV in bilateral OFC compared with nonsmokers irrespective of weight status, and such alteration is negatively associated with pack-year and FTND scores. Furthermore, we also found GMV changes related to TUD and overweight are associated with μ-opioid receptor system and TUD-related GMV alterations are associated with noradrenaline transporter maps. This study sheds light on novel multimodal neuromechanistic about the relationship between TUD and overweight, which possibly provides hints into future treatment for the special population of comorbid TUD and overweight.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Seizures are a frequent symptom of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). However, the brain regions responsible for these seizures remain unclear. To identify the brain regions causally involved in bAVM-related seizures, we retrospectively reviewed 220 patients with unruptured bAVMs. Using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses, we tested whether individual brain regions were associated with unruptured bAVM-related seizures. The result revealed that unruptured bAVMs causing seizures are anatomically heterogeneous at the voxel level. Subsequently, lesion network mapping (LNM) analyses was performed to determine whether bAVMs causing seizures belonged to a distributed brain network. LNM analyses indicated that these lesions were located in a functional network characterized by connectivity to the left caudate and precuneus. Moreover, the discrimination performance of the identified seizure network was evaluated in discovery set by calculating the individualized network damage score and was tested in validation set. Based on the calculated network damage scores, patients were divided into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. The prevalence of seizures significantly differed among the three risk categories in both discovery (<i>p</i> = .003) and validation set (<i>p</i> = .004). Finally, we calculated the percentage of voxels in the canonical resting-state networks that overlapped with the seizure-susceptible brain regions to investigate the involvement of resting-state networks. With an involvement percentage over 50%, the frontoparietal control (82.9%), limbic function (76.7%), and default mode network (69.3%) were considered to be impacted in bAVM-related seizures. Our study identified the seizure-susceptible brain regions for unruptured bAVMs, which could be a plausible neuroimaging biomarker in predicting possible seizures.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, viewed with transcranial ultrasound, is a risk marker for Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy adults aged 50–70 years is associated with reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition in primary motor cortex, and that the reduced intracortical inhibition is associated with neurochemical markers of activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in primary motor cortex was assessed with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in 23 healthy adults with normal (<i>n</i> = 14; 61 ± 7 yrs) or abnormally enlarged (hyperechogenic; <i>n</i> = 9; 60 ± 6 yrs) area of SN echogenicity. Thirteen of these participants (7 SN− and 6 SN+) also underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate pre-SMA neurochemistry. There was no relationship between area of SN echogenicity and short-interval intracortical inhibition in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. There was a significant positive relationship, however, between area of echogenicity in the right SN and the magnitude of intracortical facilitation in the right (ipsilateral) primary motor cortex (<i>p</i> = .005; multivariate regression), evidenced by the amplitude of the conditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) at the 10–12 ms interstimulus interval. This relationship was not present on the left side. Pre-SMA glutamate did not predict primary motor cortex inhibition or facilitation. The results suggest that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy older adults may be associated with changes in excitability of motor cortical circuitry. The results advance understanding of brain changes in healthy older adults at risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now a routine treatment option for patients suffering from medically refractory epilepsy. DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has proven to be effective but, despite its success, few patients experience complete cessation of seizure activity. However, improving the therapy is challenging because the mechanism underlying its action remains largely unknown. One angle on improving the effectiveness of ANT stimulation is to better understand the various anatomic regions that send projections to and through this area. Here, the authors utilized a connectomic atlas of the mouse brain to better understand the regions projecting to the ANT and were particularly interested by the presence of robust cholinergic projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). A subsequent review of the literature resulted in limited studies, which presented convincing evidence supporting this region's role in seizure control present in acute rodent models of epilepsy. It is thus the purpose of this paper to encourage further research into the role of the LDT on seizure mitigation, with mechanistic effects likely stemming from its cholinergic projections to the ANT. While previous studies have laid a firm foundation supporting the role of this region in modulation of seizure activity, modern scientific methodology has yet to be applied to further elucidate the mechanisms and potential benefits associated with LDT stimulation in the epileptic population.</p>

     alt="Vascular perfusion differs in two distinct PDGFRβ-positive zones within the ischemic core of male mice 2 weeks following photothrombotic stroke"/>
<p>Blood vessels in the ischemic core and peri-lesion are capable of flow 2 weeks post-photothrombotic stroke. There are two PDGFRβ-positive zones within the ischemic core, one which resembles fibrotic scarring, adjacent to a GFAP-positive peri-lesion, whereas the other is primarily vessel associated.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Stroke therapy has largely focused on preventing damage and encouraging repair outside the ischemic core, as the core is considered irreparable. Recently, several studies have suggested endogenous responses within the core are important for limiting the spread of damage and enhancing recovery, but the role of blood flow and capillary pericytes in this process is unknown. Using the Rose Bengal photothrombotic model of stroke, we illustrate blood vessels are present in the ischemic core and peri-lesional regions 2 weeks post stroke in male mice. A FITC-albumin gel cast of the vasculature revealed perfusion of these vessels, suggesting cerebral blood flow (CBF) may be partially present, without vascular leakage. The length of these vessels is significantly reduced compared to uninjured regions, but the average width is greater, suggesting they are either larger vessels that survived the initial injury, smaller vessels that have expanded in size (i.e., arteriogenesis), or that neovascularization begins with larger vessels. Concurrently, we observed an increase in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ, a marker of pericytes) expression within the ischemic core in two distinct patterns, one which resembles pericyte-derived fibrotic scarring at the edge of the core, and one which is vessel associated and may represent blood vessel recovery. We find little evidence for dividing cells on these intralesional blood vessels 2 weeks post stroke. Our study provides evidence flow is present in PDGFRβ-positive vessels in the ischemic core 2 weeks post stroke. We hypothesize intralesional CBF is important for limiting injury and for encouraging endogenous repair following cerebral ischemia.</p>

                Leptomeningeal metastasis is associated with dismal prognosis and has few treatment options. However, very little is known about the immune response to leptomeningeal metastasis. Here, by establishing an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer leptomeningeal metastasis, we found that tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were generated in deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs) and played an important role in controlling leptomeningeal metastasis. Mechanistically, T cells in dCLNs displayed a senescence phenotype and their recruitment was impaired in mice bearing cancer cells that preferentially colonized in leptomeningeal space. Upregulation of p53 suppressed the transcription of VLA-4 in senescent dCLN T cells and consequently inhibited their migration to the leptomeningeal compartment. Clinically, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cerebrospinal fluid of patients with leptomeningeal metastasis exhibited senescence and VLA-4 downregulation. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunosenescence drives leptomeningeal metastasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive re-analysis of hairpin small RNAs in fungi reveals loci with conserved links</a></h4>

              
                RNA interference is an ancient mechanism with many regulatory roles in eukaryotic genomes, with small RNAs acting as their functional element. While there is a wide array of classes of small-RNA-producing loci, those resulting from stem-loop structures (hairpins) have received profuse attention. Such is the case of microRNAs (miRNAs), which have distinct roles in plants and animals. Fungi also produce small RNAs, and several publications have identified miRNAs and miRNA-like (mi/milRNA) hairpin RNAs in diverse fungal species using deep sequencing technologies. Despite this relevant source of information, relatively little is known about mi/milRNA-like features in fungi, mostly due to a lack of established criteria for their annotation. To systematically assess mi/miRNA-like characteristics and annotation confidence, we searched for publications describing mi/milRNA loci and re-assessed the annotations for 41 fungal species. We extracted and normalized the annotation data for 1,727 reported mi/milRNA-like loci and determined their abundance profiles, concluding that less than half of the reported loci passed basic standards used for hairpin RNA discovery. We found that fungal mi/milRNA are generally more similar in size to animal miRNAs and were frequently associated with protein-coding genes. The compiled genomic analyses identified 25 mi/milRNA loci conserved in multiple species. Our pipeline allowed us to build a general hierarchy of locus quality, identifying more than 150 loci with high-quality annotations. We provide a centralized annotation of identified mi/milRNA hairpin RNAs in fungi which will serve as a resource for future research and advance in understanding the characteristics and functions of mi/milRNAs in fungal organisms.

                The cerebral cortex generates flexible behavior by learning. Reinforcement learning is thought to be driven by error signals in midbrain dopamine neurons. However, they project more densely to basal ganglia than cortex, leaving open the possibility of another source of learning signals for cortex. The locus coeruleus (LC) contains most of the brain's norepinephrine (NE) neurons and project broadly to cortex. We measured activity from identified mouse LC-NE neurons during a behavioral task requiring ongoing learning from reward prediction errors (RPEs). We found two types of LC-NE neurons: neurons with wide action potentials (type I) were excited by positive RPE and showed an increasing relationship with change of choice likelihood. Neurons with thin action potentials (type II) were excited by lack of reward and showed a decreasing relationship with change of choice likelihood. Silencing LC-NE neurons changed future choices, as predicted from the electrophysiological recordings and a model of how RPEs are used to guide learning. We reveal functional heterogeneity of a neuromodulatory system in the brain and show that NE inputs to cortex act as a quantitative learning signal for flexible behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous activation of cortical somatosensory networks depresses their excitability in preterm human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The activity of the developing cortex is characteristically discontinuous where sudden high amplitude bursts interrupt periods of quiescent background. While the functional importance of this activity is clear, its aetiology is not known. Here, we hypothesise that this alternating pattern arises because of 'refractoriness' of cortical networks following spontaneous activation. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether spontaneous activity in sensory networks depressed their excitability by measuring the impact of ongoing activity on the response to an external sensory stimulus. We recorded cortical activity before and after mechanical tactile stimulation of hands and feet in 35 preterm infants of median 32 weeks post-menstrual age. Results: Mechanical stimulation evoked wideband energy increases with two distinct peaks within the delta and alpha-beta band. The delta activity engaged extended cortical areas, while the faster activity engaged local somatotopically specific areas. By then characterising the spectro-spatial properties of the spontaneous activity preceding stimulation, we showed that baseline energy with a distribution and spectral profile similar to that of somatosensory-evoked activity dampened the energy changes elicited by touching the body. Discussion: Sensory-evoked activity in preterm human neonates likely represents the coordinated activation of extended (tangential) and local (e.g. columnar) cortical aggregates. The occurrence of spontaneous cortical events in the same cortical regions depresses their excitability preventing their immediate re-engagement. This 'refractoriness' offers the first etiological explanation to the cyclical burst-quiescence pattern typical of preterm cortical activity.

                Genetic association studies have demonstrated the critical involvement of the microglial immune response in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Phospholipase C-gamma-2 (PLCG2) is selectively expressed by microglia and acts in many immune receptor signaling pathways. In AD, PLCG2 is induced uniquely in plaque-associated microglia. A genetic variant of PLCG2, PLCG2 P522R variant, is a mild hypermorph that attenuates AD risk. We report the identification of a PLCG2 variant, PLCG2 M28L variant, associated with loss-of-function and confers increased AD risk. PLCG2 P522R variant attenuates disease in an amyloidogenic murine AD model, whereas PLCG2 M28L variant exacerbates the plaque burden associated with altered phagocytosis and A{beta} clearance. The variants bidirectionally modulate disease pathology by inducing distinct transcriptional programs that identify microglial subpopulations associated with protective or detrimental phenotypes. In summary, these findings identify PLCG2 M28L variant as a new AD risk variant and demonstrate that PLCG2 variants can differentially orchestrate microglial responses in AD pathogenesis that can be therapeutically targeted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARM1 detection in oligodendrocytes but not Schwann cells though sarm1/Sarm1 deletion does not perturb CNS nor PNS myelination in zebrafish and mice.</a></h4>

              
                SARM1 is a central regulator of programmed axon death and is required to initiate axon self-destruction after traumatic and toxic insults to the nervous system. Abnormal activation of this axon degeneration pathway is increasingly recognized as a contributor to human neurological disease and SARM1 knockdown or inhibition has become an attractive therapeutic strategy to preserve axon loss in a variety of disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system. Despite this, it remains unknown whether Sarm1/SARM1 is present in myelinating glia and whether it plays a role in myelination in the PNS or CNS. It is important to answer these questions to understand whether future therapies inhibiting SARM1 function may have unintended deleterious impacts on myelination. Here we show that Sarm1 mRNA is present in oligodendrocytes in zebrafish but only detectable at low levels in Schwann cells in both zebrafish and mice. We find SARM1 protein is readily detectable in murine oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo and activation of endogenous SARM1 in oligodendrocytes induces cell death. In contrast, SARM1 protein is not detectable in Schwann cells and satellite glia in the adult murine nervous system. Cultured Schwann cells contain negligible functional SARM1 and are insensitive to specific SARM1 activators. Using zebrafish and mouse Sarm1 mutants, we show that SARM1 is not required for initiation of myelination nor myelin sheath maintenance by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Thus, strategies to inhibit SARM1 function in the nervous system to treat neurological disease are unlikely to perturb myelination in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Color and gloss constancy under diverse lighting environments</a></h4>

              
                When we look at an object, we simultaneously see how glossy or matte it is, how light or dark, and what color. Yet, at each point on the object's surface, both diffuse and specular reflections are mixed in different proportions, resulting in substantial spatial chromatic and luminance variations. To further complicate matters, this pattern changes radically when the object is viewed under different lighting conditions. The purpose of this study was to simultaneously measure our ability to judge color and gloss using an image set capturing diverse object and illuminant properties. Participants adjusted the hue, lightness, chroma, and specular reflectance of a reference object so that it appeared to be made of the same material as a test object. Critically, the two objects were presented under different lighting environments. We found that hue matches were highly accurate, except for under a chromatically atypical illuminant. Chroma and lightness constancy were generally poor, but these failures correlated well with simple image statistics. Gloss constancy was particularly poor, and these failures were only partially explained by reflection contrast. Importantly, across all measures, participants were highly consistent with one another in their deviations from constancy. Although color and gloss constancy hold well in simple conditions, the variety of lighting and shape in the real world presents significant challenges to our visual system's ability to judge intrinsic material properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptor interaction and co-clustering regulates serotonergic neuron excitability</a></h4>

              
                Many psychiatric diseases including depression, schizophrenia and anxiety have been associated with serotonin (5-HT) signaling dysfunction. We previously showed that the 5-HT2B receptor was expressed by 5-HT neurons together with 5-HT1A receptors. Whether 5-HT2B and 5-HT1A receptors interact and the functional consequences of this putative interaction are unknown. Using co-immunoprecipitation, BRET, confocal and super-resolution microscopy in hippocampal cultured neurons, we found that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors form heterodimers and co-cluster at the surface of dendrites. The 5-HT2B receptor cell-surface expression was reduced and the clusters were redistributed upon expression of the 5-HT1A receptor suggesting functional interactions between the two receptors. Furthermore, the expression of the 5-HT2B receptor prevented the 5-HT1A receptor agonist-induced internalization, whereas the presence of the 5-HT1A receptor mimicked the effect of the stimulation of the 5-HT2B receptor on its surface expression. These data demonstrate a direct crosstalk between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors. To investigate the functional impact of this interaction in-vivo, we assessed 5-HT neuron excitability from mice lacking 5-HT2B receptors in 5-HT neurons. We found upon 5-HT1A receptor stimulation that the firing activity of 5-HT neurons was increased in the absence of 5-HT2B receptors and decreased in its presence through regulation of SK channels, thus demonstrating the functional significance of these receptor interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Get a new perspective on EEG: Convolutional neural network encoders for parametric t-SNE.</a></h4>

              
                Background: t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a method for reducing high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional representation and is mostly used for visualizing data. In parametric t-SNE, a neural network learns to reproduce this mapping. When used for EEG analysis, the data is usually first transformed into a set of features, but it is not known which features are optimal. New method: The principle of t-SNE was used to train convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to learn to produce both a high- and a low-dimensional representation, eliminating the need for feature engineering. A simple neighbor distribution based on ranked distances was used for the high- dimensional representation instead of the traditional normal distribution. To evaluate the method, the Temple University EEG Corpus was used to create three datasets with distinct EEG characters: 1) wakefulness and sleep, 2) interictal epileptiform discharges, and 3) seizure activity. Results: The CNN encoders for the three datasets produced low-dimensional representations of the da- tasets with a global and local structure that conformed well to the EEG characters and general- ized to new data. Comparison to existing methods: Compared to parametric t-SNE for either a short-time Fourier transforms or wavelet represen- tation of the datasets, the developed CNN encoders performed equally well but generally pro- duced a higher degree of clustering. Conclusions: The developed principle is promising and could be further developed to create general tools for exploring relations in EEG data, e.g., visual summaries of recordings, and trends for continuous EEG monitoring. It might also be used to generate features for other types of machine learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Scoping Review Of Mathematical Models Covering Alzheimer's Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is a complex, multi-factorial, and multi-parametric neurodegenerative etiology. Mathematical models can help understand such a complex problem by providing a way to explore and conceptualize principles, merging biological knowledge with experimental data into a model amenable to simulation and external validation, all without the need for extensive clinical trials. We performed a scoping review of mathematical models of AD with a search strategy applied to the PubMed database which yielded 846 entries. After applying our exclusion criteria, only 17 studies remained from which we extracted data, focusing on three aspects of mathematical modeling: how authors addressed continuous time, how models were solved, and how the high dimensionality and non-linearity of models were managed. Most articles modeled AD at the cellular range of the disease process, operating on a short time scale (e.g., minutes; hours), i.e., the micro view (12/17); the rest considered regional or brain-level processes, with longer timescales (e.g., years, decades) (the macro view). Most papers were concerned primarily with Abeta (n=8), few modeled with both Abeta and tau proteins (n=3), and some considered more than these two factors in the model (n=6). Models used partial differential equations (PDEs; n=3), ordinary differential equations (ODEs; n=7), both PDEs and ODEs (n=3). Some didn't specify the mathematical formalism (n=4). Sensitivity analyses were performed in only a small number of papers (4/17). Overall, we found that only two studies could be considered valid in terms of parameters and conclusions, and two more were partially valid. The majority (n=13) either was invalid or there was insufficient information to ascertain their status. While mathematical models are powerful and useful tools for the study of AD, closer attention to reporting is necessary to gauge the quality of published studies to replicate or continue with their contributions. Keywords: Mathematical model; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid beta; Tau protein; Sensitivity analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different hemispheric lateralization for periodicity and formant structure of vowels in the auditory cortex and its changes between childhood and adulthood</a></h4>

              
                The spectral formant structure and periodicity pitch are the major features that determine the identity of vowels and the characteristics of the speaker. However, very little is known about how the processing of these features in the auditory cortex changes during development. To address this question, we independently manipulated the periodicity and formant structure of vowels while measuring auditory cortex responses using MEG in children aged 7-12 years and adults. We analyzed the sustained negative shift of source current associated with these vowel properties, which was present in the auditory cortex in both age groups despite differences in the transient components of the auditory response. In adults, the sustained activation associated with formant structure was lateralized to the left hemisphere early in the auditory processing stream requiring neither attention nor semantic mapping. This lateralization was not yet established in children, in whom the right hemisphere contribution to formant processing was strong and decreased during or after puberty. In contrast to the formant structure, periodicity was associated with a greater response in the right hemisphere in both children and adults. These findings suggest that left-lateralization for the automatic processing of vowel formant structure emerges relatively late in ontogenesis and pose a serious challenge to current theories of hemispheric specialization for speech processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory stabilized network behaviour in a balanced neural mass model of a cortical column</a></h4>

              
                Strong inhibitory recurrent connections can reduce the tendency for a neural network to become unstable. This is known as inhibitory stabilization; networks that are unstable in the absence of strong inhibitory feedback because of their unstable excitatory recurrent connections are known as Inhibition Stabilized Networks (ISNs). One of the characteristics of ISNs is their "paradoxical response", where perturbing the inhibitory neurons with additional excitatory input results in a decrease in their activity after a temporal delay instead of increasing their activity. Here, we develop a model of populations of neurons across different layers of cortex. Within each layer, there is one population of inhibitory neurons and one population of excitatory neurons. The connectivity weights across different populations in the model are derived from a synaptic physiology database provided by the Allen Institute. The model shows a gradient of excitation-inhibition balance across different layers in the cortex, where superficial layers are more inhibitory dominated compared to deeper layers. To investigate the presence of ISNs across different layers, we measured the membrane potentials of neural populations in the model after perturbing inhibitory populations. The results show that layer 2/3 in the model does not operate in the ISN regime but layers 4 and 5 do operate in the ISN regime. These results accord with neurophysiological findings that explored the presence of ISNs across different layers in the cortex. The results show that there may be a systematic macroscopic gradient of inhibitory stabilization across different layers in the cortex that depends on the level of excitation-inhibition balance, and that the strength of the paradoxical response increases as the model moves closer to bifurcation points.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Golgi Fragmentation - One of the Earliest Organelle Phenotypes in Alzheimer's Disease Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, with no current cure. Consequently, alternative approaches focusing on early pathological events in specific neuronal populations, besides targeting the well-studied Amyloid beta (Ab) accumulations and Tau tangles, are needed. In this study, we have investigated disease phenotypes specific to glutamatergic forebrain neurons and mapped the timeline of their occurrence, by implementing familial and sporadic human induced pluripotent stem cell models as well as the 5xFAD mouse model. We recapitulated characteristic late AD disease phenotypes, such as increased Ab secretion and Tau hyperphosphorylation, as well as previously well documented mitochondrial and synaptic deficits. Intriguingly, we identified Golgi fragmentation as one of the earliest AD phenotypes, indicating potential impairments in protein processing and post-translational modifications. Computational analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed differentially expressed genes involved in glycosylation and glycan patterns, whilst total glycan profiling revealed minor glycosylation differences. This indicates general robustness of glycosylation besides the observed fragmented morphology. Importantly, we identified that genetic variants in Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) associated with AD could aggravate the Golgi fragmentation and subsequent glycosylation changes. In summary, we identified Golgi fragmentation as one of the earliest disease phenotypes in AD neurons in various in vivo and in vitro complementary disease models, which can be exacerbated via additional risk variants in SORL1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple antagonist calcium-dependent mechanisms control CaM Kinase-1 subcellular localization in a C. elegans thermal nociceptor</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptive habituation is a conserved process through which pain-sensitivity threshold is adjusted based on past sensory experience and which may be dysregulated in human chronic pain conditions. Noxious heat habituation in C. elegans involves the nuclear translocation of CaM kinase-1 (CMK-1) in the FLP thermo-nociceptors neurons, causing reduced animal heat sensitivity and avoidance responses. The phosphorylation of CMK-1 on T179 by CaM kinase kinase-1 (CKK-1) is required for nuclear entry. Recently, we identified a specific Nuclear Export Sequence (NES) required to maintain CMK-1 in the cytoplasm at rest (20 {degrees}C) and showed that Ca2+/CaM binding is sufficient to enhance CMK-1 affinity for IMA-3 via a specific Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) in order to promote nuclear entry after persistent heat stimulation (90 min at 28{degrees}C) (Ippolito et al., 2021). Here, we identified additional functional NES and NLS on CMK-1, whose activity can counteract previously identified elements. Furthermore, we clarify the relationship between the CaM-binding-dependent and T179-dependent effects. T179 phosphorylation can promotes nuclear entry both downstream of CaM-binding and as part of an independent/parallel pathway. Moreover, T179 phosphorylation can also produce the opposite effect by promoting nuclear export. Taken together, our studies show that multiple calcium-dependent regulatory mechanisms converge to bias the activity pattern across a network of NES/NLS elements, in order to activate CMK-1 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, change its localization equilibrium and actuate stimulation-dependent nociceptive plasticity.

	<p>Depression and alcohol misuse, frequently comorbid, are associated with altered reward processing. However, no study has examined whether and how the neural markers of reward processing are shared between depression and alcohol misuse. We studied 43 otherwise-healthy drinking adults in a monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) during fMRI. All participants were evaluated with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Beck&amp;amp;rsquo;s Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess the severity of drinking and depression. We performed whole brain regressions against each AUDIT and BDI-II score to investigate the neural correlates and evaluated the findings at a corrected threshold. We performed mediation analyses to examine the inter-relationships between win/loss responses, alcohol misuse, and depression. AUDIT and BDI-II scores were positively correlated across subjects. Alcohol misuse and depression shared win-related activations in frontoparietal regions and parahippocampal gyri (PHG), and right superior temporal gyri (STG), as well as loss-related activations in the right PHG and STG, and midline cerebellum. These regional activities (&amp;amp;beta;&amp;amp;rsquo;s) completely mediated the correlations between BDI-II and AUDIT scores. The findings suggest shared neural correlates interlinking depression and problem drinking both during win and loss processing and provide evidence for co-morbid etiological processes of depressive and alcohol use disorders.</p>

	<p>This study aims to explore the effects of gaze stabilization exercises (GSEs) on gait, plantar pressure, and balance function in post-stroke patients (&amp;amp;le;6 months). Forty post-stroke patients were randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 20). The experimental group performed GSEs combined with physical therapy, while the control group only performed physical therapy, once a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to test the balance function and the risk of falling, which was the primary outcome. The Timed Up and Go test (TUGT) evaluated the walking ability and the fall risk. The envelope ellipse area and the plantar pressure proportion of the affected side were used to measure the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s supporting capacity and stability in static standing. The anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior center of pressure displacement velocity was used to test the weight-shifting capacity. Compared to the control group, the swing phase of the affected side, swing phase&amp;amp;rsquo;s absolute symmetric index, envelope ellipse area when eyes closed, and TUGT of the experimental group had significantly decreased after GSEs (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); the BBS scores, TUGT, the anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior COP displacement velocity, and the plantar pressure proportion of the affected side had significantly increased after 4 weeks of training (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, GSEs combined with physical therapy can improve the gait and balance function of people following stroke. Furthermore, it can enhance the weight-shifting and one-leg standing capacity of the affected side, thus reducing the risk of falling.</p>

	<p>Differential axonal myelination synchronises signalling over different axon lengths. The consequences of myelination processes described at the cellular level for the regulation of myelination at the macroscopic level are unknown. We analysed multiple cohorts of myelin-sensitive brain MRI. Our aim was to (i) confirm a previous report of anti-correlation between myelination in subcortical and sensorimotor areas in healthy subjects, (ii) and thereby test our hypothesis for a regulatory interaction between them. We analysed nine image-sets across three different human cohorts using six MRI modalities. Each image-set contained healthy controls (HC) and ME/CFS subjects. Subcortical and Sensorimotor regions of interest (ROI) were optimised for the detection of anti-correlations and the same ROIs were used to test the HC in all image-sets. For each cohort, median MRI values were computed in both regions for each subject and their correlation across the cohort was computed. We confirmed negative correlations in healthy controls between subcortical and sensorimotor regions in six image-sets: three T1wSE (p = 5 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;8, 5 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;7, 0.002), T2wSE (p =2 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;6), MTC (p = 0.01), and WM volume (p = 0.02). T1/T2 was the exception with a positive correlation (p = 0.01). This myelin regulation study is novel in several aspects: human subjects, cross-sectional design, ROI optimization, spin-echo MRI and reproducible across multiple independent image-sets. In multiple independent image-sets we confirmed an anti-correlation between subcortical and sensorimotor myelination which supports a previously unreported regulatory interaction. The subcortical region contained the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s primary regulatory nuclei. We suggest a mechanism has evolved whereby relatively low subcortical myelination in an individual is compensated by upregulated sensorimotor myelination to maintain adequate sensorimotor performance.</p>

	<p>Since the emergence of Virtual Reality technology, it has been adopted in the field of neurology. While Virtual Reality has contributed to various rehabilitation approaches, its potential advantages, especially in diagnosis, have not yet been fully utilized. Moreover, new tides of the Metaverse are approaching rapidly, which will again boost public and research interest and the importance of immersive Virtual Reality technology. Nevertheless, accessibility to such technology for people with neurological disorders has been critically underexplored. Through this perspective paper, we will briefly look over the current state of the technology in neurological studies and then propose future research directions, which hopefully facilitate beneficial Virtual Reality studies on a wider range of topics in neurology.</p>

	<p>Aiming to investigate the relationship between pulse pressure (PP) and cognitive decline, cognitively normal subjects from a community-based longitudinal cohort were followed-up for 4 years. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate global cognitive function, and a &amp;amp;ge;2-point decrease in the MMSE score from baseline was defined as cognitive decline. Restricted cubic spline, multivariable linear regression and logistic regression were used to investigate the relationship between PP and cognitive decline. A total of 1173 participants completed the follow-up, and 205 (17.5%) met the criteria for cognitive decline. Restricted cubic splines showed no nonlinear relationship between PP and &amp;amp;Delta;MMSE (Poverall = 0.037, Pnon-linear = 0.289) or cognitive decline (Poverall = 0.003, Pnon-linear = 0.845). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that PP was positively related to &amp;amp;Delta;MMSE (b = 0.021, p = 0.020). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that PP was positively associated with cognitive decline (OR = 1.020, p = 0.023). A stratified analysis found an association between PP and cognitive decline in participants who were aged &amp;amp;le;65 years, male, and APOE&amp;amp;epsilon;4 noncarriers and who had school education &amp;amp;le;6 years or hypertension. A sensitivity analysis after propensity-score matching did not alter our findings. These findings highlight that elevated PP is associated with rapid cognitive decline, particularly in males, middle-aged, low-educated, hypertensive individuals and APOE&amp;amp;epsilon;4 noncarriers.</p>

	<p>Sleep deprivation (SD) negatively affects several aspects of cognitive performance, and one of the most widely-used tools to evaluate these effects is the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). The present study investigated the possibility of predicting changes induced by SD in vigilant attention performance by evaluating the baseline electroencephalographic (EEG) activity immediately preceding the PVT stimuli onset. All participants (n = 10) underwent EEG recordings during 10 min of PVT before and after a night of SD. For each participant, the root mean square (RMS) of the baseline EEG signal was evaluated for each 1 s time window, and the respective average value was computed. After SD, participants showed slower (and less accurate) performance in the PVT task. Moreover, a close relationship between the changes in the baseline activity with those in cognitive performance was identified at several electrodes (Fp2, F7, F8, P3, T6, O1, Oz, O2), with the highest predictive power at the occipital derivations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in frailty and its associated factors in the community dwelling elderly Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective analytical study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is a scarcity of quality literature on the prevalence of frailty among community dwelling elderly in India. This study was originally planned to analyze the longitudinal trends in frailty status of community dwelling elderly in an Indian population as well to identify factors associated with frailty in the Indian context. However, the recruitment phase of this study coincided with one of the largest lockdowns in history, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and this gave us a unique opportunity to study the effects this pandemic enforced, as a result of the necessary restrictions, on the frailty status as well the factors affecting frailty in the elderly. Methods: A prospective observational study was designed and conducted amongst 19 community dwelling elderly of Dakshina Kannada District, in Karnataka India. Outcome variables of frailty (EFIP), physical activity (PASE), functional mobility (TUG), gait speed (10-meter walk test), nutritional status (MNA®-SF) body composition (BIA), and strength (dynamometry), were measured at baseline and on follow-up after three months. The changes occurring in these variables over the three-month period were analyzed and the change in frailty was independently correlated with changes in each of the other outcomes. Results: We couldn’t identify any statistically significant difference in frailty over a period of three months. However, there was a highly significant change in the physical activity status, lower extremity muscle strength, body composition, functional mobility, gait speed, and cognitive function in the same time period. Conclusions: Though individual determinants of frailty in community dwelling changed over a three-month period, these changes failed to produce any observable/measurable difference in frailty status.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling time-varying volatility using GARCH models: evidence from the Indian stock market [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this study, we examined the volatility of the Indian stock market from 2008 to 2021. Owing to the financial crisis, volatility forecasting of the Indian stock market has become crucial for economic and financial analysts. An empirical study of the returns of the NSE indices revealed an autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic trend in the Indian stock market. Methods: Using GARCH 1, 1 (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) and FIGARCH (fractionally integrated GARCH), we examine investor behaviour and the persistence of long-term volatility. Results: The empirical findings of the estimated models suggest that shocks persist for a long time in NSE returns. Furthermore, bad news has a greater impact on stock volatility than good news. The return on assets is stable but highly volatile, even though the Indian economy has experienced the global crash to some extent. Conclusions: Models of volatility derived from the GARCH equation provide accurate forecasts and are useful for portfolio allocation, performance measurement, and option valuation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Carotenoids from female Grapsus albolineatus as potential anti-ageing compounds [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Grapsus albolineatus is thought to have a high concentration of carotenoid pigments. Although studies on male G. albolineatus have been conducted, no studies on pigment extraction from female G. albolineatus have been carried out. Carotenoids have a high ability to fight free radicals. Previous research has shown that carotenoids can fight free radicals that cause premature skin-aging. The purpose of this research was to find out what kinds of carotenoids are found in G. albolineatus and whether they can act as natural inhibitors of proteins that cause premature aging, such as glucogenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase enzymes. Methods: Carotenoids were extracted from G. albolineatus using column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); molecular docking and visualization were done with Autodock 4.2 and Discovery Studio/Biovia, respectively.   Results: According to HPLC data, there are carotenoid pigments such as didehydroastaxanthin, tetrahydroastaxanthin, dihydroastaxanthin, diatoxanthin, astaxanthin, and adonixanthin.  According to molecular docking experiments, pigment carotenoids from G. albolineatus are efficient inhibitors of protein elastase and hyaluronidase. Conclusions: G. albolineatus carotenoids have the potential to be anti-aging since they are more effective as protein elastase and hyaluronidase inhibitors than their native inhibitors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of vitamin D supplementation intake among children; cross-sectional observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The purpose of this study was to review the vitamin D supplementation intake status among children in the general public, determine the vitamin D supplements practices, and the barriers that parents and children face with supplementation.   Methods: A cross-sectional observational questionnaire-based survey study design was used. A convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. An online Rao soft sample size calculator was applied to determine the sample size of 319. The response rate of participants was expected to be 63%, the margin of error was 5% and the level of confidence was 95%.     Results: A total of 248 parents (89.1% mothers (n =203)) and 15.7% fathers (n=39) with a mean ± SD age of 35.4 ± 7.04 years, completed the study (77.7% response rate). Parents reported that the supplements used the most by children were vitamin D supplements (21.85%) and multivitamins (21.8%) followed by calcium supplements (5.6%). However, 27.8% of children in this study did not take any supplements. Of all the parents, 65% (162) of them reported sending their child outside to play while 34.67% (86) of parents had reported no outdoor activity. Approximately 184 (74.2%) parents reported the child’s diet to contain multiple natural sources of vitamin D. However, 69 (27.8%) parents reported giving none of the natural sources of vitamin D to their children through the diet. Parents with higher education about 62.9% (n=156) had a higher frequency of providing vitamin D supplements to their children. Children in high-income families (43.63%) were more likely to take vitamin D supplements than those in middle- or low-income families.     Conclusion: The study concluded that challenges like the educational and financial background of parents, family-income level, and health insurance status could help aid in addressing the overall burden of vitamin D deficiency among young children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese international student-athletes’ adjustment experience at the National Collegiate Athletic Association [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Currently, the number of International-Student Athletes (ISAs) in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is increasing over time and Japan is the biggest market for recruiting in Asia. Whereas international students are playing an increasingly important role in the NCAA, several studies have reported that ISAs face challenges in adjusting to their dual identities as students and athletes at universities in the US. Furthermore, it has been cleared Asian students studying at US universities have some challenges because of cultural and linguistic differences. However, it remains unclear whether the difficulties experienced by Japanese ISAs are the same as or different to the adjustment-related challenges experienced by other ISAs or Asian students. The purpose of this study is to clarify challenges for ISAs from Japan in adjusting to the United States’ universities. Situating in the ISA adjustment model and using a unique case study design, 13 Japanese ISAs at the NCAA Division I universities were interviewed, and data were coded by a continuous comparative analysis method. The results revealed that Japanese ISAs who participated in this study faced academic, social, athletic, personal-emotional, and institutional adjustment challenges. Particularly, Japanese ISAs differed from ISAs from other countries in several points; cultural differences, differences in communication styles, and systemic differences in academia and athletics between Japan and the US. For promoting adjustment of Japanese ISAs, this study suggests; gaining experience and getting information to understand and familiarize with the differences, building relationships with linguistic and culturally diverse people to understand various cultures, encouraging universities and coaches to understand specific difficulties for Japanese ISAs.

                Background In 2020, breast cancer has become the most common cancer in the world and in Indonesia. Searching for anticancer drugs using computational methods is considered more effective and selective than other methods. Gallic acid and its derivatives (esters and amides) are compounds that have biological activities such as anticancer effects. The purpose of this study was to analyse the molecular modelling and ADMET (Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) profile of gallic acid derivative compounds (N-alkyl gallamides) as anticancer agents. Methods Target proteins were selected by analysis of protein-protein and drug-protein interactions. Molecular modelling was done by molecular docking. Predictive analysis of the ADMET profile of gallic acid and its derivatives (N-alkyl gallamide) was conducted using Marvin Sketch, Swissadme, protox II, and pkCSM pharmacokinetics. The selected target proteins were JUN, AKT1, CASP3, and CASP7. Results Compounds N-octyl gallamide, N-ters-butyl gallamide, and N-isoamil gallamide were the three best gallic acid derivatives based on molecular modelling analysis of target proteins associated with breast cancer. The ADMET profile of the N-alkyl gallamide compound is predictable and shows a good profile as a candidate for anticancer drugs. Conclusion N-octyl gallamide, N-ters-butyl gallamide, and N-isoamil gallamide have potential as anti-breast cancer agents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Removal of reinforcement improves instrumental performance in humans by decreasing a general action bias rather than unmasking learnt associations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah Kurtenbach, Eduard Ort, Monja Isabel Froböse, Gerhard Jocham</p>

Performance during instrumental learning is commonly believed to reflect the knowledge that has been acquired up to that point. However, recent work in rodents found that instrumental performance was enhanced during periods when reinforcement was withheld, relative to periods when reinforcement was provided. This suggests that reinforcement may mask acquired knowledge and lead to impaired performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such a beneficial effect of removing reinforcement translates to humans. Specifically, we tested whether performance during learning was improved during non-reinforced relative to reinforced task periods using signal detection theory and a computational modelling approach. To this end, 60 healthy volunteers performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement. To probe acquired knowledge in the absence of reinforcement, we interspersed blocks without feedback. In these non-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased <i>d’</i>, indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. However, computational modelling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learnt values, but to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias. Together with an initial tendency to act, this is sufficient to drive differential changes in hit and false alarm rates that jointly lead to an increased <i>d’</i>. To conclude, the improved instrumental performance in the absence of reinforcement observed in studies using asymmetrically reinforced go/no-go tasks may reflect a change in response bias rather than unmasking latent knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pushing the boundaries of behavioral analysis could aid psychiatric drug discovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brian M. Sweis, Eric J. Nestler</p>

Drug discovery for psychiatric conditions is stagnating. Behavioral changes could be used as a primary phenotypic screen for new drug candidates, if enough useful data can be generated from behavioral models. Could machine learning be the answer to extracting the data we need?

Behavioral changes could be used as a primary phenotypic screen for new drug candidates for psychiatric conditions, if enough useful data can be generated from current behavioral models. In this Perspective, the authors advocate for using machine learning to extract the data we need.

                Background: Medicinal plants are potential resources for isolating drug candidates. Various plants have been reported to possess pharmacological effects including anti-hepatitis C activities. The current study examined the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activities of Acacia mangium extracts in solvents with various polarities and further evaluated the mechanism of action of the extracts using Western blotting and combination treatment models. Methods: The leaves of A. mangium were extracted in two phases, first in ethanol and then in solvents with different polarities (n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol). HCV-infected Huh7it-1 cells were treated with the extracts at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 µg/mL. Results: The results revealed the strong anti-HCV activities of the extracts. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50s) of the ethanol, n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extracts were of 4.6 ± 0.3, 2.9 ± 0.2, 0.2 ± 0.3, and 2.8 ± 0.2 μg/mL, respectively, and no cytotoxic effect was detected. These extracts displayed stronger effects than the positive control ribavirin. The mode of action of the ethanol extract was evaluated at 30 µg/mL, revealing that the inhibitory effect was stronger on the post-entry step than on the entry step. Western blotting revealed that the extracts decreased NS3 protein expression, indicating that virus replication was suppressed. Further evaluation illustrated that combined treatment with the ethanol extract enhanced the anti-viral activity of simeprevir. Conclusions: These results indicated that A. mangium leaves could represent sources of anti-HCV agents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: An exceptionally large spindle cell lipoma of the popliteal fossa [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spindle cell lipoma (SCL) is an uncommon subtype of lipomas. It usually occurs in the posterior side of the trunk such as neck, back and shoulders and rarely touches the extremities. Only four cases of SCL of the knee and no cases of SCL of the popliteal fossa have been reported in the literature. We present herein the largest case of SCL of the popliteal fossa and knee to our knowledge. Case presentation: A 75-year-old woman presented with a slow growing swelling of the left knee. Physical examination showed a 12 cm well-limited painless mass of the left popliteal fossa. The mass was pediculated with a central ulceration. MRI scan showed a tumoral mass of the left popliteal fossa with some non-dilated vessels draining to the long saphenous vein. The mass had no evidence of invasion of the underlying tissues. The patient underwent a surgical resection of the mass with postoperative recovery. The histological examination revealed a tumoral proliferation diffusely expressing CD34 without malignancy evidence, and a Ki67 proliferation index <1%. This morphological and immunohistochemical aspect is typical of a SCL. Clinical discussion: SCL is a rare histological variant of lipoma occurring mostly in the posterior side of the upper trunk. SCL of the knee or the popliteal fossa are exceptional. Clinically, it presents as a gradually increasing painless mass with a long evolving history. Histologically, these tumors are made of spindle-shaped cells, rope-like collagen fibers and mature adipocytes surrounded by a fibrous capsule. Immunohistologically, spindle cell lipomas usually show diffuse and strong expression of CD34, and to a lesser degree vimentin. The optimal treatment of SCL is a surgical marginal resection. Conclusions: SCL represents an infrequent subtype, and its atypical presentation should push clinicians to further investigations in order to rule out more worrisome malignancies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gallbladder adenocarcinomas undergo subclonal diversification and selection from precancerous lesions to metastatic tumors</a></h4>

              
                We aimed to elucidate the evolutionary trajectories of gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBAC) using multi-regional and longitudinal tumor samples. Using whole-exome sequencing data, we constructed phylogenetic trees in each patient and analyzed mutational signatures. A total of 11 patients including 2 rapid autopsy cases were enrolled. The most frequently altered gene in primary tumors was <i>ERBB2</i> and <i>TP53</i> (54.5%), followed by <i>FBXW7</i> (27.3%). Most mutations in frequently altered genes in primary tumors were detectable in concurrent precancerous lesions (biliary intraepithelial neoplasia, BilIN), but a substantial proportion was subclonal. Subclonal diversity was common in BilIN (n=4). However, among subclones in BilIN, a certain subclone commonly shrank in concurrent primary tumors. In addition, selected subclones underwent linear and branching evolution, maintaining subclonal diversity. Combined analysis with metastatic tumors (n=11) identified branching evolution in 9 patients (81.8%). Of these, 8 patients (88.9%) had a total of 11 subclones expanded at least 7-fold during metastasis. These subclones harbored putative metastasis-driving mutations in cancer-related genes such as <i>SMAD4</i>, <i>ROBO1</i>, and <i>DICER1</i>. In mutational signature analysis, 6 mutational signatures were identified: 1, 3, 7, 13, 22, and 24 (cosine similarity &gt;0.9). Signatures 1 (age) and 13 (APOBEC) decreased during metastasis while signatures 22 (aristolochic acid) and 24 (aflatoxin) were relatively highlighted. Subclonal diversity arose early in precancerous lesions and clonal selection was a common event during malignant transformation in GBAC. However, selected cancer clones continued to evolve and thus maintained subclonal diversity in metastatic tumors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rhythmic coordination and ensemble dynamics in the hippocampal-prefrontal network during odor-place associative memory and decision making</a></h4>

              
                Memory-guided decision making involves long-range coordination across sensory and cognitive brain networks, with key roles for the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In order to investigate the mechanisms of such coordination, we monitored activity in hippocampus (CA1), PFC, and olfactory bulb (OB) in rats performing an odor-place associative memory guided decision task on a T-maze. During odor sampling, the beta (20-30 Hz) and respiratory (7-8 Hz) rhythms (RR) were prominent across the three regions, with beta and RR coherence between all pairs of regions enhanced during the odor-cued decision making period. Beta phase modulation of phase-locked CA1 and PFC neurons during this period was linked to accurate decisions, with a key role of CA1 interneurons in temporal coordination. Single neurons and ensembles in both CA1 and PFC encoded and predicted animals' upcoming choices, with different cell ensembles engaged during decision-making and decision execution on the maze. Our findings indicate that rhythmic coordination within the hippocampal-prefrontal-olfactory bulb network supports utilization of odor cues for memory-guided decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the mitoribosomal small subunit with streptomycin reveals Fe-S clusters and physiological molecules</a></h4>

              
                The mitoribosome regulates cellular energy production, and its dysfunction is associated with aging. Inhibition of the mitoribosome can be caused by off-target binding of antimicrobial drugs and was shown to be coupled with a bilateral decreased visual acuity. Previously, we reported mitochondria-specific protein aspects of the mitoribosome, and in this article we present a 2.4-Å resolution structure of the small subunit in a complex with the anti-tuberculosis drug streptomycin that reveals roles of non-protein components. We found iron–sulfur clusters that are coordinated by different mitoribosomal proteins, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) associated with rRNA insertion, and posttranslational modifications. This is the first evidence of inter-protein coordination of iron–sulfur, and the finding of iron–sulfur clusters and NAD as fundamental building blocks of the mitoribosome directly links to mitochondrial disease and aging. We also report details of streptomycin interactions, suggesting that the mitoribosome-bound streptomycin is likely to be in hydrated gem-diol form and can be subjected to other modifications by the cellular milieu. The presented approach of adding antibiotics to cultured cells can be used to define their native structures in a bound form under more physiological conditions, and since streptomycin is a widely used drug for treatment, the newly resolved features can serve as determinants for targeting.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel evolution of reduced cancer risk and tumor suppressor duplications in Xenarthra</a></h4>

              
                The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan within species, but there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan between species indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Previously we showed that several large bodied <i>Afrotherian</i> lineages evolved reduced intrinsic cancer risk, particularly elephants and their extinct relatives (<i>Proboscideans</i>), coincident with pervasive duplication of tumor suppressor genes (Vazquez and Lynch 2021). Unexpectedly, we also found that <i>Xenarthrans</i> (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) evolved very low intrinsic cancer risk. Here, we show that: 1) several <i>Xenarthran</i> lineages independently evolved large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced intrinsic cancer risk; 2) the reduced cancer risk in the stem lineages of <i>Xenarthra</i> and <i>Pilosa</i> coincided with bursts of tumor suppressor gene duplications; 3) cells from sloths proliferate extremely slowly while <i>Xenarthran</i> cells induce apoptosis at very low doses of DNA damaging agents; and 4) the prevalence of cancer is extremely low <i>Xenarthrans</i>, and cancer is nearly absent from armadillos. These data implicate the duplication of tumor suppressor genes in the evolution of remarkably large body sizes and decreased cancer risk in <i>Xenarthrans</i> and suggest they are a remarkably cancer resistant group of mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human Dectin-1 is O-glycosylated and serves as a ligand for C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2</a></h4>

              
                C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) elicit immune responses upon recognition of glycoconjugates present on pathogens and self-components. While Dectin-1 is the best-characterized CLR recognizing b-glucan on pathogens, the endogenous targets of Dectin-1 are not fully understood. Herein, we report that human Dectin-1 is a ligand for CLEC-2, another CLR expressed on platelets. Biochemical analyses revealed that Dectin-1 is a mucin-like protein as its stalk region is highly <i>O</i>-glycosylated. A sialylated core 1 glycan attached to the EDxxT motif of human Dectin-1, which is absent in mouse Dectin-1, provides a ligand moiety for CLEC-2. Strikingly, the expression of human Dectin-1 in mice rescued the lethality and lymphatic defect resulting from a deficiency of Podoplanin, a known CLEC-2 ligand. This finding is the first example of an innate immune receptor also functioning as a physiological ligand to regulate ontogeny upon glycosylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Scratch-AID: a deep-learning based system for automatic detection of mouse scratching behavior with high accuracy</a></h4>

              
                Mice are the most commonly used model animals for itch research and for development of anti-itch drugs. Most labs manually quantify mouse scratching behavior to assess itch intensity. This process is labor-intensive and limits large-scale genetic or drug screenings. In this study, we developed a new system, Scratch-AID Automatic Itch Detection), which could automatically identify and quantify mouse scratching behavior with high accuracy. Our system included a custom-designed videotaping box to ensure high-quality and replicable mouse behavior recording and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) trained with frame-labeled mouse scratching behavior videos, induced by nape injection of chloroquine (CQ). The best trained network achieved 97.6% recall and 96.9% precision on previously unseen test videos. Remarkably, Scratch-AID could reliably identify scratching behavior in other major mouse itch models, including the acute cheek model, the histaminergic model, and a chronic itch model. Moreover, our system detected significant differences in scratching behavior between control and mice treated with an anti-itch drug. Taken together, we have established a novel deep learning-based system that is ready to replace manual quantification for mouse scratching behavior in different itch models and for drug screening.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Feedback inhibition underlies new computational functions of cerebellar interneurons</a></h4>

              
                The function of a feedback inhibitory circuit between cerebellar Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) was defined by combining optogenetics, neuronal activity recordings both in cerebellar slices and <i>in vivo</i>, and computational modeling. Purkinje cells inhibit a subset of MLIs in the inner third of the molecular layer. This inhibition is non-reciprocal, short-range (less than 200 mm) and is based on convergence of 1-2 Purkinje cells onto MLIs. During learning-related eyelid movements <i>in vivo</i>, the activity of a subset of MLIs progressively increases as Purkinje cell activity decreases, with Purkinje cells usually leading the MLIs. Computer simulations indicate that these relationships are best explained by the feedback circuit from Purkinje cells to MLIs and that this feedback circuit plays a central role in making cerebellar learning efficient.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of adrenergic β1-AR/Gαs signaling promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in juvenile mice through activation of RhoA-YAP axis</a></h4>

              
                The regeneration potential of the mammalian heart is incredibly limited, as cardiomyocyte proliferation ceases shortly after birth. β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade has been shown to improve heart functions in response to injury; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we inhibited β-AR signaling in the heart using metoprolol, a cardio-selective β blocker for β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) to examine its role in heart maturation and regeneration in postnatal mice. We found that metoprolol enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction, resulting in reduced scar formation and improved cardiac function. Moreover, the increased cardiomyocyte proliferation was also induced by the genetic deletion of <i>Gnas</i>, the gene encoding G protein alpha subunit (Gαs), a downstream effector of β-AR. Genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed that the Hippo-effector YAP, which is associated with immature cardiomyocyte proliferation, was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes of b-blocker treated and <i>Gnas</i> cKO hearts. Moreover, the increased YAP activity is modulated by RhoA signaling. Our pharmacological and genetic studies reveal that b1-AR-Gas-YAP signaling axis is involved in regulating postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. These results suggest that inhibiting b-AR-Gas signaling promotes the regenerative capacity and extends the cardiac regenerative window in juvenile mice by activating YAP-mediated transcriptional programs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Critical roles for 'housekeeping' nucleases in Type III CRISPR-Cas immunity</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR-Cas systems are a family of adaptive immune systems that use small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to protect prokaryotes from invading plasmids and viruses (i.e. phages). Type III systems launch a multi-layered immune response that relies upon both Cas and non-Cas cellular nucleases, and although the functions of Cas components have been well described, the identities and roles of non-Cas participants remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> employs two degradosome-associated nucleases, PNPase and RNase J2, to promote crRNA maturation and eliminate invading nucleic acids (Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019). Here, we identify RNase R as a third 'housekeeping' nuclease critical for immunity. We show that RNase R works in concert with PNPase to complete crRNA maturation, and identify specific interactions with Csm5, a member of the Type III effector complex, which facilitate nuclease recruitment/stimulation. Further, we demonstrate that RNase R and PNPase are required to maintain robust anti-plasmid immunity, particularly when targeted transcripts are sparse. Altogether, our findings expand the known repertoire of accessory nucleases required for Type III immunity and highlight the remarkable capacity of these systems to interface with diverse cellular pathways to ensure successful defense.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Emotional learning retroactively promotes memory integration through rapid neural reactivation and reorganization</a></h4>

              
                Neutral events preceding emotional experiences can be better remembered, likely by assigning them as significant to guide possible use in future. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms of how emotional learning enhances memory for past mundane events remain unclear. By two behavioral studies and one functional magnetic resonance imaging study with an adapted sensory preconditioning paradigm, we show rapid neural reactivation and connectivity changes underlying emotion-charged retroactive memory enhancement. Behaviorally, emotional learning enhanced initial memory for neutral associations across the three studies. Neurally, emotional learning potentiated trial-specific reactivation of overlapping neural traces in the hippocampus and stimulus-relevant neocortex. It further induced rapid hippocampal-neocortical functional reorganization supporting such retroactive memory benefit, as characterized by enhanced hippocampal-neocortical coupling modulated by the amygdala during emotional learning, and a shift of hippocampal connectivity from stimulus-relevant neocortex to transmodal prefrontal-parietal areas at post-learning rests. Together, emotional learning retroactively promotes memory integration for past neutral events through stimulating trial-specific reactivation of overlapping representations and reorganization of associated memories into an integrated network to foster its priority for future use.

                Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) are frequently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including increased risk for restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs). Consistent with observations in humans, FXS model mice display distinct RRBs and hyperactivity that are consistent with dysfunctional cortico-striatal circuits, an area relatively unexplored in FXS. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we dissected the contribution of two populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (SPNs) in the expression of RRBs in FXS model mice. We found that dysregulated protein synthesis at cortico-striatal synapses is a molecular culprit of the synaptic and ASD-associated motor phenotypes displayed by FXS model mice. Cell-type-specific translational profiling of the FXS mouse striatum revealed differentially translated mRNAs, providing critical information concerning potential therapeutic targets. Our findings represent the first evidence of a cell-type specific impact of the loss of FMRP on translation and the sequence of neuronal events in the striatum that drive RRBs in FXS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">At Which Low Amplitude Modulated Frequency Do Infants Best Entrain? A Frequency Tagging Study</a></h4>

              
                Previous infant entrainment research has shown neural entrainment to a wide range of stimuli and amplitude modulated frequencies. However, it is unknown if infants neurally entrain more strongly to some frequencies more than others, and to which low amplitude modulated frequency infants show the strongest entrainment. The current study seeks to address this by testing the neural entrainment of N=23 4-6-month-old infants and N=22 control group adult caregivers while they listened to a range of sinusoidally amplitude modulated beep stimuli at rest (no sound), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 Hz. Analysis examined differences across power and phase, regions of interest predetermined by previous literature and by segmented time windows. Results showed that the strongest entrainment was at 2Hz for both adult and infant participants; that there was no significant difference in power and phase, entrainment was occipital temporal and slightly left fronto-central in adults and right fronto-central and left occipito-temporal in infants, leading to some regions of interest used in previous studies being significant in infants and all regions of interest being significant in adults. Segmenting by time window did not show any significant increase or decrease in entrainment over time, but longer time windows showed a stronger entrainment response. In conclusion, it is important to choose appropriate stimulation frequencies when investigating entrainment between stimulation frequencies or across ages; whole head recording is recommended to see the full extent of activation; there is no preference on power vs phase analyses; and longer recordings show stronger effects.

                Brain-computer interface (BCI) experiments have shown that animals are able to adapt their recorded neural activity in order to receive reward. Recent studies have highlighted two phenomena. First, the speed at which a BCI task can be learned is dependent on how closely the required neural activity aligns with pre-existing activity patterns: learning "out-of-manifold" tasks is slower than "in-manifold" tasks. Second, learning happens by "re-association": the overall distribution of neural activity patterns does not change significantly during task learning. These phenomena have been presented as distinctive aspects of BCI learning. Here we show, using simulations and theoretical analysis, that both phenomena result from the simple assumption that behaviour and representations are improved via gradient-based algorithms. We invoke Occams Razor to suggest that this straightforward explanation should be pre-ferred when accounting for these experimental observations.

                Sexual behaviour is the sine qua non for procreation for several species and is traditionally viewed to be regulated by sex steroid hormones. However, several species exhibit steroid-independent sexual behaviour, and its molecular understanding is only beginning to be uncovered. We do not yet have a cell-specific understanding of the roles non-neuronal cells play in this phenomenon. Forty B6D2F1 hybrid male mice underwent orchidectomy and some of them exhibited consistent ejaculatory reflexes at least 62 weeks post-orchidectomy over 11 sexual behaviour tests (>180 minutes each), defined as steroid-independent (SI) maters (21.80%), and those that do not, defined as SI non-maters (25%). Using flow cytometry, we compared the preoptic area immunoexpression in NeuN+ neurons and Iba1+ microglia between SI maters and SI non-maters (n = 6 per group). We found neuronal immunoexpression up-regulated for amyloid precursor protein and androgen receptor, as well as down-regulated for glucocorticoid receptor. In conjunction, microglial immunoexpression of amyloid precursor protein up-regulated. These data suggest there are cell-specific immunoexpression changes including a role of non-neuronal cells in steroid-independent male sexual behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult born hippocampal granule cells promote pattern separation by bidirectionally modulating the remapping of place and cue cells.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits a unique form of neural plasticity that results from continuous integration of adult born neurons, referred to as  adult neurogenesis. Recent studies have proposed that adult neurogenesis promotes the ability to encode new memories without interference from previously stored memories that share similar features, through a neural computation known as pattern separation. However, due to lack of in vivo physiological evidence, the manner in which adult neurogenesis contributes to pattern separation remains unknown. Here, we investigate the contribution of functionally integrated yet immature adult born granule cells (iGCs) to DG computations by examining how chronic ablation or acute chemogenetic silencing of iGCs affects the activity of mature granule cells (mGCs) using in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. In both cases we observed altered remapping of mGCs but in opposite directions depending on their tuning selectivity. Rather than broadly modulating the activity of all mGCs, iGCs promote the remapping of place cells but limit the remapping of mGCs representing sensory cues (cue cells). We propose that these properties of iGCs explain their role in pattern separation because they promote the formation of non-overlapping representations for identical sensory cues encountered in different locations. Conversely, the absence of iGCs shifts the DG network to a state dominated by sensory cue information, a situation that is consistent with the overgeneralization often observed in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuomotor interactions in the mouse forebrain mediated by extrastriate cortico-cortical pathways</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian visual system can be broadly divided into two functional processing pathways: a dorsal stream supporting visually and spatially guided actions, and a ventral stream enabling object recognition. In rodents, the majority of visual signaling in the dorsal stream is transmitted to frontal motor cortices via extrastriate visual areas surrounding V1, but exactly where and to what extent V1 feeds into motor-projecting visual regions is not well known. To address this we employed a dual labeling strategy in male and female mice in which efferent projections from V1 were labeled anterogradely, and motor-projecting neurons in higher visual areas were labeled with retrogradely traveling adeno-associated virus (rAAV-retro) injected in M2. In flattened sections of dorsal cortex, the most pronounced colocalization V1 output and M2 input occurred in extrastriate areas AM, PM, RL and AL. Coronal sections further showed that neurons in both superficial and deep layers in these regions project to M2, but high resolution volumetric reconstructions revealed that the vast majority of putative synaptic contacts from V1 onto M2-projecting neurons occurred in layer 2/3. These findings support the existence of a dorsal processing stream in the mouse visual system, where visual signals reach motor cortex largely via feedforward projections in anteriorly and medially located extrastriate areas.

Significance StatementVisually guided motor behavior depends on the long-distance relay of signals from visual cortex to frontal motor cortices, but the neuroanatomical connections linking visual and motor systems in rodents are not fully charted. Here, we characterized such pathways by injecting anterograde tracers in primary visual cortex (V1) and retrogradely traveling virus in motor cortex (M2), and visualizing where the projections overlapped. We found preferential colocalization of V1 output and M2-projecting neurons in anteriorly- and medially-located higher visual areas. 3D volumetric reconstructions further showed high rates of putative synaptic connections mainly in superficial layers. Thus, visual signals in the mouse dorsal visual stream reach motor areas at least in part via superficial, feedforward connections in a subset of extrastriate areas.

                Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) most often leads to permanent paralysis due to the inability of axons to regenerate in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In the past, we have shown that mast cells (MCs) improve the functional outcome after SCI by suppressing scar tissue formation at the lesion site via mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP6). In this study, we investigated whether recombinant mMCP6 can be used therapeutically to improve the functional outcome after SCI. Therefore, we applied mMCP6 locally via an intrathecal catheter in the subacute phase after a spinal cord hemisection injury in mice. Our findings showed that hind limb motor function was significantly improved in mice that received recombinant mMCP6 compared to the vehicle-treated group. In contrast to our previous findings in mMCP6 knockout mice, the lesion size and expression levels of the scar components fibronectin, laminin, and axon-growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were not affected by the treatment with recombinant mMCP6. Surprisingly, no difference in infiltration of CD4+ T cells and reactivity of Iba-1+ microglia/macrophages at the lesion site was observed between the mMCP6-treated mice and control mice. Additionally, local protein levels of the pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN{gamma}, and MCP-1 were comparable between the two treatment groups, indicating that locally applied mMCP6 did not affect inflammatory processes after injury. However, the increase in locomotor performance in mMCP6-treated mice was accompanied by reduced demyelination and astrogliosis in the perilesional area after SCI. Consistently, we found that TNF-a/IL-1B-astrocyte activation was decreased, and that oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation was increased after recombinant mMCP6 treatment in vitro. Mechanistically, this suggests effects of mMCP6 on reducing astrogliosis and improving (re)myelination in the spinal cord after injury. In conclusion, these data show for the first time that recombinant mMCP6 is therapeutically active in enhancing recovery after SCI.

                Despite being twice as likely to get Alzheimers disease (AD), African Americans have been grossly underrepresented in AD research. While emerging evidence indicates that African Americans with AD have lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Tau compared to Caucasians, other differences in AD CSF biomarkers have not been fully elucidated. Here, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling of CSF from African Americans and Caucasians with and without AD to identify both common and divergent AD CSF biomarkers. Multiplex tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) quantified 1,840 proteins from 105 control and 98 AD patients of which 100 identified as Caucasian while 103 identified as African American. Consistent with previous findings, the increase of Tau levels in AD was greater in Caucasians than in African Americans by both immunoassay and TMT-MS measurements. Network analysis organized the CSF proteome into 14 modules associated with brain cell-types and biological pathways. CSF modules which included 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ and YWHAG), demonstrated equivalent disease-related elevations in both African Americans and Caucasians with AD, whereas other modules demonstrated more profound disease changes within race. Modules enriched with proteins involved with glycolysis and neuronal/cytoskeletal proteins, including Tau, were more increased in Caucasians than in African Americans with AD. In contrast, a module enriched with synaptic proteins including VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2 was significantly lower in African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Using a targeted proteomic approach (selected reaction monitoring) followed by a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis we measured levels of VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2, which were significantly better at classifying African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Collectively, our findings provide insight into additional protein biomarkers and pathways reflecting underlying brain pathology that are shared or differ by race.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations optimize information rate in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Low-frequency oscillations shape how neurons sample their synaptic inputs, hence regulating information exchange among neural circuits. In the hippocampus, theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) enable the temporal organization of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code. However, the advantages of the specific theta band over other frequency ranges remain unclear. It is possible that this specific frequency range is optimizing a trade-off between information throughput and biophysical constraints of the neuronal substrate. To test this hypothesis, we analyze a physiologically constrained model of the rodent hippocampus comprising stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons driven by oscillations. By estimating the information rate of the phase code for a range of noise and frequency levels, we identify a trade-off between sampling frequency and coding precision. We observe that, under physiological noise levels, theta-band oscillations optimize the speed-precision trade-off, maximizing information rate. Further, we demonstrate that theta optimizes this trade-off throughout the entire dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus with its pronounced gradients of several physiological properties. In addition, we find that maintaining an optimal information rate relies on the concurrent modulation of both frequency and amplitude, hence explaining the locomotion speed-dependent modulations of the hippocampal theta oscillation that are observed in rodents and humans. Overall, our results suggest that low-frequency oscillations are adapted to maximize the information rate of neural sampling given the temporal and biophysical constraints under which neural circuits operate.

Author SummaryIn the hippocampus, a prominent oscillation in the theta band (4-8 Hz) allows single neurons to rhythmically sample and represent the ever-changing input signals coming from the cortex. However, it remains unclear why this hippocampal rhythm lies within the theta band. Here, we show that neurons that use oscillations to sample noisy input signals face a trade-off between their sampling speed (i.e., the frequency) and their coding precision (i.e., the accuracy of the representation). We find that, for simulated hippocampal neurons, this trade-off is optimized precisely within the theta band. Importantly, our framework allows us to explain other fundamental properties of the hippocampus while having implications for other brain areas that might use similar sampling mechanisms. In summary, we provide an explanation as to why oscillations in the hippocampus are confined within the theta band, and lay down the foundations to study how properties of single neurons determine the optimal sampling frequencies in a particular neural circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory gating of thalamocortical inputs onto rat gustatory insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the rat primary gustatory cortex (GC), a subregion of the larger insular cortex, neurons display time-varying neural responses to gustatory stimuli. GC taste responses are dramatically reduced following inactivation of the gustatory thalamus, the parvicellular region of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPMpc). Pharmacological inactivation of VPMpc also has a profound effect on GC spontaneous activity. This indicates that the projection from VPMpc plays a crucial role in GC taste processing as well as in the control of its state. How VPMpc afferents engage GC circuits and drive neuronal ensembles to effectively code tastant identity, as well as modulate the overall state of the GC network, remains unclear. To investigate the synaptic properties and organization of VPMpc afferents in GC, we employed a circuit-breaking optogenetic approach, stimulating VPMpc terminal fields while performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from GC neurons in rat acute slices. Informed by previous studies of thalamocortical inputs to other sensory cortices, we hypothesized that VPMpc-GC synapses have laminar- and cell-specific properties that gate sensory input, conferring computationally flexibility to how taste information is processed in GC. We found that VPMpc-GC synapses are strongly gated by the activity regime of VPMpc afferents, as well as by feedforward and feedback inhibition onto VPMpc terminals. These results provide novel insight into the circuit underpinning of GC responsiveness to incoming thalamocortical activity.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe report that the input from the primary taste thalamus to the primary gustatory cortex (GC) shows distinct properties compared to primary thalamocortical synapses onto other sensory areas. VPMpc afferents in GC make synapses with excitatory neurons distributed across all cortical layers and display frequency-dependent short-term plasticity to repetitive stimulation, thus they do not fit the classic distinction between drivers and modulators typical of other sensory thalamocortical circuits. Feedforward inhibition gates thalamocortical activation and provides local corticothalamic feedback via presynaptic ionotropic and metabotropic GABA receptors. The connectivity and inhibitory control of thalamocortical synapses support the time-varying response dynamics to taste stimuli observed in GC neurons in vivo.

                The two pituitary gonadotropins, Fsh and Lh, regulate the reproductive function in vertebrates. While many studies have investigated the regulation of gonadotropin production and release by the sex steroid feedback, its role on the regulation of gonadotrope cell number remains unclear. Using medaka as a model and an optimized protocol to restore physiological sex steroids levels following gonadectomy, we show that gonadal sex steroids not only decrease fshb transcript levels, but also Fsh cell number in both sexes. We then investigated the origin of the Fsh cell hyperplasia induced by gonadectomy. In both sexes, BrdU incubation shows that this is achieved via Fsh cell mitosis. In situ hybridization reveals that new Fsh cells also originate from transdifferentiating Tsh cells in females, but not in males. Both phenomena are inhibited by sex steroid supplementation via feeding. In males (but not females), gonadectomy (without recovery with sex steroid supplementation) also reduces sox2 transcript levels and Sox2-immunopositive population volume, suggesting that sox2-progenitors may be recruited to produce new Fsh cells. Opposite to Fsh cells, gonadectomy decreases lhb levels in both sexes, and levels are not restored by sex steroid supplementation. In addition, the regulation of Lh cell number also seems to be sex dependent. Removal of gonadal sex steroids stimulates Lh cell mitosis in male (like Fsh cells), but not in females. To conclude, our study provides the first evidence on sexually dimorphic mechanisms used in the fish pituitary to remodel gonadotrope populations in response to sex steroids.

HIGHLIGHTS- Supplementing gonadectomized fish with sex steroids via feeding allows for the recovery of physiological circulating levels of sex steroids.
- Gonadal sex steroids not only regulate gonadotrope cell activity, but also gonadotrope cell number.
- Removal of gonadal sex steroids induces Fsh cell hyperplasia via mitosis of Fsh cells in both sexes, and transdifferentiation of Tsh cells into bi-hormonal Tsh/Fsh cells in females only.
- Gonadectomy also reduces the number of Sox2 progenitor cells in males (but not in females), suggesting that they may be recruited to contribute to Fsh cell hyperplasia.
- Removal of gonadal sex steroids stimulates Lh cell mitosis in males, but not in females.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theory of systems memory consolidation via recall-gated plasticity</a></h4>

              
                In a variety of species and behavioral contexts, learning and memory formation recruits two neural systems, with initial plasticity in one system being consolidated into the other over time. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve learning rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments. We show that recall-gated consolidation gives rise to a number of phenomena that are present in behavioral learning paradigms, including spaced learning effects, task-dependent rates of consolidation, and differing neural representations in short- and long-term pathways.

                Positions of objects are coded relative to their surroundings, presumably providing visual stability even when we move our eyes around a visual scene. But when does this perceived stability of objects arise? Here we use a visual illusion, the frame-induced position shift, and measure electrophysiological activity elicited by an object whose perceived position is either shifted due to a surrounding frame or not, thus dissociating perceived and physical locations. We found that early visually-evoked responses were sensitive to physical location information earlier in time ([~]70ms) than perceived location information ([~]140ms). Furthermore, we show that location information can be reliably decoded across physical and perceived locations during the later time interval (140-180ms) but not during the earlier time interval (70-110ms). Together these results suggest that visual stability of objects emerges relatively late and is thus dependent on recurrent feedback from higher processing stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic activation of visual thalamus generates artificial visual percepts</a></h4>

              
                The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a retinotopic relay center where visual inputs from the retina are processed and relayed to the visual cortex, has been proposed as a potential target for artificial vision. At present, it is unknown whether optogenetic LGN stimulation is sufficient to elicit behaviorally relevant percepts and the properties of LGN neural responses relevant for artificial vision have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that tree shrews pretrained on a visual detection task can detect optogenetic LGN activation using an AAV2-CamKII-ChR2 construct and readily generalize from visual to optogenetic detection. We also characterize how amplitude and frequency of optogenetic stimulation affect behavioral performance. Given the importance of temporal stimulation parameters, we also study tree shrew behavioral ability to discriminate among pairs of visual flicker frequencies and demonstrate performance transfer among related discrimination problems as well as limitations. Neural recordings in LGN and primary visual cortex (V1) examining two flicker discriminations reveal that while LGN neurons multiplex information about temporal stimulation discriminations, V1 neurons explicitly encode information about one or the other discriminations but not both. Our findings confirm the LGN as a potential target for visual prosthetics and introduce a distinction in stimulus encoding between thalamic and cortical representations that could be of fundamental importance in artificial vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Senescent Schwann cells induced by aging and chronic denervation impair axonal regeneration after peripheral nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                After peripheral nerve injuries, successful axonal growth and functional recovery requires the reprogramming of Schwann cells into a reparative phenotype, a process dependent on the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun. Nevertheless, axonal regeneration is greatly impaired in aged organisms or after chronic denervation leading to important clinical problems. This regenerative failure has been associated to a diminished c-Jun expression by Schwann cells, but whether the inability of these cells to maintain a repair state is associated to the transition into a phenotype inhibitory for axonal growth, has not been evaluated so far. We find that repair Schwann cells transitions into a senescent phenotype, characterized by diminished c-Jun expression and secretion of factor inhibitory for axonal regeneration in both aging and chronic denervation. In both conditions, elimination of senescent Schwann cells by systemic senolytic drug treatment or genetic targeting improves nerve regeneration and functional recovery in aging and chronic denervation, associated with an upregulation of c-Jun expression and a decrease in nerve inflammation. This work provides the first characterization of senescent Schwann cells and their impact over axonal regeneration in aging and chronic denervation, opening new avenues for enhancing regeneration, and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries.

	<p>Although previous studies have reported a facial expression classification deficit among adults with SDB, we do not know whether these findings can be generalized to children. In our study, children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) were divided into three groups: primary snoring (n = 51), mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (n = 39), and moderate/severe OSA (n = 26). All participants, including 20 healthy controls, underwent an overnight polysomnography recording and the Emotional Expression Recognition Task. Psychosocial problems were evaluated using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). There was a borderline significant interaction between expression category and group on reaction times. Further analysis revealed that positive classification advantage (PCA) disappeared in the moderate/severe OSA group, whereas it persisted in the control, primary snoring, and mild OSA groups. Emotional symptoms were positively correlated with OAHI. In both the happy and sad conditions, RT was negatively related to age and body mass index (BMI) but was independent of the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI), arterial oxygen (SaO2) and total sleep time. The accuracy of identifying a sad expression was negatively related to conduct problems. Children with moderate/severe OSA exhibited dysfunction in facial expression categorization, which could potentially affect social communication ability.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterised by demyelination in the central nervous system. The cuprizone-induced demyelination model is often used in mice to test novel treatments for multiple sclerosis. However, despite significant demyelination, behavioural deficits may be subtle or have mixed results depending on the paradigm used. Furthermore, the sex differences within the model are not well understood. In the current study, we have sought to understand the behavioural deficits associated with the cuprizone-induced demyelination model in both male and female C57BL/6J mice. Using Black gold II stain, we found that cuprizone administration over 6 weeks caused significant demyelination in the corpus callosum that was consistent across both sexes. Cuprizone administration caused increased mechanical sensitivity when measured using an electronic von Frey aesthesiometer, with no sex differences observed. However, cuprizone administration decreased motor coordination, with more severe deficits seen in males in the horizontal bar and passive wire hang tests. In contrast, female mice showed more severe deficits in the motor skill sequence test. Cuprizone administration caused more anxiety-like behaviours in males compared to females in the elevated zero maze. Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the sex differences involved in the behavioural aspects of cuprizone-induced demyelination, which could allow for a better translation of results from the laboratory to the clinic.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Attention is an important cognitive process in daily life. However, limited cognitive resources have been allocated to attention, especially for multiple objects and its mechanism is still unclear. Most of the previous studies have been based on the static attention paradigms with relatively lower ecological validity. Thus, we aimed to explore the attention processing mechanism in a multiple object tracking (MOT) task by using a dynamic attention paradigm. Two experiments were conducted to assess whether there was a multi-focus attention processing model, and whether the processing model changes with the number of target balls. (2) Methods: During the experiments, 33 university students completed MOT combined with the simultaneous&amp;amp;ndash;sequential paradigm, with tracking accuracy and reaction time of correct reaction as indicators. (3) Results: (i) When there were two target balls, an obvious bilateral field advantage was apparent. (ii) When there were four target balls, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; performance was significantly better when stimuli were presented simultaneously than when they were presented sequentially, showing a multi-focus attention processing model. (4) Conclusion: Attention processing is characterized by flexibility, providing strong evidence to support the multi-focus theory.</p>

	<p>The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) provides a direct trajectory to ventral skull base lesions, avoidance of brain retraction, and clear visualization of cranial nerves as they exit skull base foramina. Despite these benefits, the EEA is not without complications. Here, we review published literature highlighting complications associated with the EEA including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, cranial nerve (CN) dysfunction, pituitary gland dysfunction, internal carotid artery (ICA) injury, infection, and others; we place special emphasis on discussing the prevention of these complications. As widespread adoption of the EEA continues, it becomes critical to educate surgeons regarding potential complications and their prevention while identifying gaps in the current literature to guide future research and advances in clinical care.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits that usually have an impact on quality of life and independence. To reduce impairment, various rehabilitation programs have been proposed, but their effects on both cognitive and motor aspects have not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, most intervention is focused on lower limb treatment rather than upper limbs. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 3-week upper limb vibratory stimulation training on cognitive functioning in 20 individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. We analyzed cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trial Making Test, Digit Symbol, Digit Span Forward and Backward and Alertness) and motor performance (Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;part III; Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire) before treatment, at the end of treatment and one month post treatment. After rehabilitation, a statistically significant improvement was observed in terms of global cognitive status, attention, global motor functioning and disability. The results suggest an impact of upper limb motor rehabilitation on cognition in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Future studies on neuromotor interventions should investigate their effects on cognitive functioning to improve understanding of cognitive motor interaction in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>Exposure to light at night, insomnia, and disrupted circadian patterns could be considered risk factors for developing noncommunicable diseases. Understanding the awareness of the general population about the abovementioned factors could be essential to predict noncommunicable diseases. This report aimed to investigate the general community&amp;amp;rsquo;s interest in circadian, insomnia, metabolism, and light using Google Trends, and to evaluate results from different geographic areas. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for the factors mentioned, filtered by the &amp;amp;ldquo;Health&amp;amp;rdquo; category, were collected between 2007 and 2021. Moreover, RSVs were analysed in five different European languages. Worldwide mean RSVs for &amp;amp;ldquo;Circadian&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;Insomnia&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;Light&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;Metabolism&amp;amp;rdquo; during the study period were 2%, 13.4%, 62.2%, and 10%, respectively. In different developed countries, searching for light, insomnia, and metabolism were different, suggesting a variable level of awareness. Limited knowledge about the circadian pattern of human activities was detected. The highest correlation coefficient was calculated. Our results suggest the potential role of extensive data analysis in understanding the public interest and awareness about these risk factors. Moreover, it should be interpreted as the onset of stimulus for researchers to use comprehensible language for reaching comprehensive media coverage to prevent sleep and circadian system disturbances.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The first oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs, <i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2, yellow cells) are detected in the preoptical area of the hypothalamus at 2 dpf. One day later, 3 dpf, these cells invade the optic chiasm and colonize the postchiasmatic region first and the prechiasmatic later (yellow cells). As they differentiate to oligodendrocytes, OPCs present more protrussions that wrap the optic nerve (ON) and become positive also for <i>sox10:tagRFP</i> (cyan cells). These triple-labeled cells are very abundant in the ON at 5 dpf. At 7 dpf, differentiated oligodendrocytes (<i>olig2:EGFP</i>) with long protrusions that ensheath the ON are only positive for <i>sox10:tagRFP</i> and not for Sox2 (white cells). The three different populations can be observed surrounding the ON. At 11 dpf, the enseathing process continues. The first evidence of myelination in the ON is at 5 dpf, based on our transgenic line <i>mbpa:tagRFPt</i> (blue square patterned cells). We have also found that Olig2 and Sox2 might play a role in the differentiation of other retinal cells including the Müller glia and that the oligodendrocytes in the optic tectum differentiate earlier than those in the ON.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system. In birds and mammals, the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) originate in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus. However, it remains unclear in other vertebrates such as fish. Thus, we have studied the early progression of OPCs during zebrafish visual morphogenesis from 2 days post fertilization (dpf) until 11 dpf using the <i>olig2:EGFP</i> transgenic line; and we have analyzed the differential expression of transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation: Sox2 (using immunohistochemistry) and Sox10 (using the transgenic line <i>sox10:tagRFP</i>). The first OPCs (<i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2) were found at 2 dpf in the POA. From 3 dpf onwards, these <i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2 cells migrate to the optic chiasm, where they invade the optic nerve (ON), extending toward the retina. At 5 dpf, <i>olig2:EGFP</i>/Sox2 cells in the ON also colocalize with <i>sox10:tagRFP</i>. When <i>olig2:EGFP</i> cells differentiate and present more projections, they become positive only for <i>sox10:tagRFP</i>. <i>olig2:EGFP/sox10: tagRFP</i> cells ensheath the ON by 5 dpf when they also become positive for a myelin marker, based on the <i>mbpa:tagRFPt</i> transgenic line. We also found <i>olig2:EGFP</i> cells in other regions of the visual system. In the central retina at 2 dpf, they are positive for Sox2 but later become restricted to the proliferative germinal zone without this marker. In the ventricular areas of the optic tectum, <i>olig2:EGFP</i> cells present Sox2 but arborized ones <i>sox10:tagRFP</i> instead. Our data matches with other models, where OPCs are specified in the POA and migrate to the ON through the optic chiasm.</p>

     alt="Emotional recognition across the adult lifespan: Effects of age, sex, cognitive empathy, alexithymia traits, and amygdala subnuclei volumes"/>
<p>This multidimensional assessment of emotion recognition in healthy adults suggested that age could affect emotion recognition differently in men and women, and these age-related differences were not mediated by amygdala volume. Our results also indicated that emotion-processing factors are not independent of personality traits and general cognition.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to recognize others' emotions is vital to everyday life. The goal of this study was to assess which emotions show age-related decline in recognition accuracy of facial emotional expressions across the entire adult lifespan and how this process is related to cognitive empathy (Theory of Mind [ToM]), alexithymia traits, and amygdala subnuclei volumes in a large cohort of healthy individuals. We recruited 140 healthy participants 18–85 years old. Facial affect processing was assessed with the Penn Emotion Recognition task (ER40) that contains images of the five basic emotions: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, and Fearful. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were acquired on a 4.7T MRI system. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationship between studied variables. We found that while both sexes demonstrated age-related reduction in recognition of happy emotions and preserved recognition of sadness, male participants showed age-related reduction in recognition of fear, while in female participants, age-related decline was linked to recognition of neutral and angry facial expressions. In both sexes, accurate recognition of sadness negatively correlated with alexithymia traits. On the other hand, better ToM capabilities in male participants were associated with improvement in recognition of positive and neutral emotions. Finally, none of the observed age-related reductions in emotional recognition were related to amygdala and its subnuclei volumes. In contrast, both global volume of amygdala and its cortical and centromedial subnuclei had significant direct effects on recognition of sad images.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Juvenile Shank3 KO Mice Adopt Distinct Hunting Strategies during Prey Capture Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mice are opportunistic omnivores that readily learn to hunt and eat insects such as crickets. The details of how mice learn these behaviors and how these behaviors may differ in strains with altered neuroplasticity are unclear. We quantified the behavior of juvenile wild-type (WT) and Shank3 knock-out (KO) mice as they learned to hunt crickets during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. This stage involves heightened cortical plasticity including homeostatic synaptic scaling, which requires Shank3, a glutamatergic synaptic protein that, when mutated, produces Phelan-McDermid syndrome and is often comorbid with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both strains showed interest in examining live and dead crickets and learned to hunt. Shank3 knock-out mice took longer to become proficient, and, after 5 d, did not achieve the efficiency of wild-type mice in either time-to-capture or distance-to-capture. Shank3 knock-out mice also exhibited different characteristics when pursuing crickets that could not be explained by a simple motor deficit. Although both genotypes moved at the same average speed when approaching a cricket, Shank3 KO mice paused more often, did not begin final accelerations toward crickets as early, and did not close the distance gap to the cricket as quickly as wild-type mice. These differences in Shank3 KO mice are reminiscent of some behavioral characteristics of individuals with ASD as they perform complex tasks, such as slower action initiation and completion. This paradigm will be useful for exploring the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie these learning and performance differences in monogenic ASD rodent models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">GnRH Neuron Excitability and Action Potential Properties Change with Development But Are Not Affected by Prenatal Androgen Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the final output from the brain to control pituitary gonadotropin secretion and thus regulate reproduction. Disruptions to gonadotropin secretion contribute to infertility, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women and symptoms resembling PCOS are observed in girls at or near the time of pubertal onset, suggesting that alterations to the system likely occurred by that developmental period. Prenatally androgenized (PNA) female mice recapitulate many of the neuroendocrine phenotypes observed in PCOS, including altered time of puberty, disrupted reproductive cycles, increased circulating levels of testosterone, and altered gonadotropin secretion patterns. We tested the hypotheses that the intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons change with puberty and with PNA treatment. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from GnRH neurons in brain slices from control and PNA females before puberty at three weeks of age and in adulthood to measure GnRH neuron excitability and action potential (AP) properties. GnRH neurons from adult females were more excitable and required less current to initiate action potential firing compared with three-week-old females. Further, the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential of the first spike was larger and its peak was delayed in adulthood. These results indicate development, not PNA, is a primary driver of changes to GnRH neuron intrinsic properties and suggest there may be developmentally-induced changes to voltage-gated ion channels in GnRH neurons that alter how these cells respond to synaptic input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amygdala Intercalated Cells: Gate Keepers and Conveyors of Internal State to the Circuits of Emotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Generating adaptive behavioral responses to emotionally salient stimuli requires evaluation of complex associations between multiple sensations, the surrounding context, and current internal state. Neural circuits within the amygdala parse this emotional information, undergo synaptic plasticity to reflect learned associations, and evoke appropriate responses through their projections to the brain regions orchestrating these behaviors. Information flow within the amygdala is regulated by the intercalated cells (ITCs), which are densely packed clusters of GABAergic neurons that encircle the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and provide contextually relevant feedforward inhibition of amygdala nuclei, including the central and BLA. Emerging studies have begun to delineate the unique contribution of each ITC cluster and establish ITCs as key loci of plasticity in emotional learning. In this review, we summarize the known connectivity and function of individual ITC clusters and explore how different neuromodulators conveying internal state act via ITC gates to shape emotionally motivated behavior. We propose that the behavioral state-dependent function of ITCs, their unique genetic profile, and rich expression of neuromodulator receptors make them potential therapeutic targets for disorders, such as anxiety, schizophrenia spectrum, and addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Regulation of the BDNF Gene in Cortical and Hippocampal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed neurotrophin that supports the survival, differentiation, and signaling of various neuronal populations. Although it has been well described that expression of BDNF is strongly regulated by neuronal activity, little is known whether regulation of BDNF expression is similar in different brain regions. Here, we focused on this fundamental question using neuronal populations obtained from rat cerebral cortices and hippocampi of both sexes. First, we thoroughly characterized the role of the best-described regulators of BDNF gene - cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors, and show that activity-dependent BDNF expression depends more on CREB and the coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in cortical than in hippocampal neurons. Our data also reveal an important role of CREB in the early induction of BDNF mRNA expression after neuronal activity and only modest contribution after prolonged neuronal activity. We further corroborated our findings at BDNF protein level. To determine the transcription factors regulating BDNF expression in these rat brain regions in addition to CREB family, we used <I>in vitro</I> DNA pulldown assay coupled with mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and bioinformatics, and propose a number of neurodevelopmentally important transcription factors, such as FOXP1, SATB2, RAI1, BCL11A, and TCF4 as brain region-specific regulators of BDNF expression. Together, our data reveal complicated brain region-specific fine-tuning of BDNF expression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To date, majority of the research has focused on the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain but much less is known whether the regulation of BDNF expression is universal in different brain regions and neuronal populations. Here, we report that the best described regulators of BDNF gene from the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor family have a more profound role in the activity-dependent regulation of BDNF in cortex than in hippocampus. Our results indicate a brain region-specific fine tuning of BDNF expression. Moreover, we have used unbiased determination of novel regulators of the BDNF gene and report a number of neurodevelopmentally important transcription factors as novel potential regulators of the BDNF expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The RNA-Binding Protein HuR Is Integral to the Function of Nociceptors in Mice and Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>HuR is an RNA-binding protein implicated in RNA processing, stability, and translation. Previously, we examined protein synthesis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We found that the HuR consensus binding element was enriched in transcripts with elevated translation. HuR is expressed in the soma of nociceptors and their axons. Pharmacologic inhibition of HuR with the small molecule CMLD-2 reduced the activity of mouse and human sensory neurons. Peripheral administration of CMLD-2 in the paw or genetic elimination of HuR from sensory neurons diminished behavioral responses associated with NGF- and IL-6-induced allodynia in male and female mice. Genetic disruption of HuR altered the proximity of mRNA decay factors near a key neurotrophic factor (TrkA). Collectively, the data suggest that HuR is required for local control of mRNA stability and reveals a new biological function for a broadly conserved post-transcriptional regulatory factor.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nociceptors undergo long-lived changes in excitability, which may contribute to chronic pain. Noxious cues that promote pain lead to rapid induction of protein synthesis. The underlying mechanisms that confer specificity to mRNA control in nociceptors are unclear. Here, we identify a conserved RNA-binding protein called HuR as a key regulatory factor in sensory neurons. Using a combination of genetics and pharmacology, we demonstrate that HuR is required for signaling in nociceptors. In doing so, we report an important mechanism of mRNA control in sensory neurons that ensures appropriate nociceptive responses to inflammatory mediators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emergence of Distinct Neural Subspaces in Motor Cortical Dynamics during Volitional Adjustments of Ongoing Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to modulate ongoing walking gait with precise, voluntary adjustments is what allows animals to navigate complex terrains. However, how the nervous system generates the signals to precisely control the limbs while simultaneously maintaining locomotion is poorly understood. One potential strategy is to distribute the neural activity related to these two functions into distinct cortical activity coactivation subspaces so that both may be conducted simultaneously without disruptive interference. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded the activity of primary motor cortex in male nonhuman primates during obstacle avoidance on a treadmill. We found that the same neural population was active during both basic unobstructed locomotion and volitional obstacle avoidance movements. We identified the neural modes spanning the subspace of the low-dimensional dynamics in primary motor cortex and found a subspace that consistently maintains the same cyclic activity throughout obstacle stepping, despite large changes in the movement itself. All of the variance corresponding to this large change in movement during the obstacle avoidance was confined to its own distinct subspace. Furthermore, neural decoders built for ongoing locomotion did not generalize to decoding obstacle avoidance during locomotion. Our findings suggest that separate underlying subspaces emerge during complex locomotion that coordinates ongoing locomotor-related neural dynamics with volitional gait adjustments. These findings may have important implications for the development of brain&ndash;machine interfaces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Locomotion and precise, goal-directed movements are two distinct movement modalities with known differing requirements of motor cortical input. Previous studies have characterized the cortical activity during obstacle avoidance while walking in rodents and felines, but, to date, no such studies have been completed in primates. Additionally, in any animal model, it is unknown how these two movements are represented in primary motor cortex (M1) low-dimensional dynamics when both activities are performed at the same time, such as during obstacle avoidance. We developed a novel obstacle avoidance paradigm in freely moving nonhuman primates and discovered that the rhythmic locomotion-related dynamics and the voluntary, gait-adjustment movement separate into distinct subspaces in M1 cortical activity. Our analysis of decoding generalization may also have important implications for the development of brain&ndash;machine interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Role for Thalamic Projection GABAergic Neurons in Circadian Responses to Light</a></h4>

              
                <p>The thalamus is an important hub for sensory information and participates in sensory perception, regulation of attention, arousal and sleep. These functions are executed primarily by glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons that extend axons to the cortex and initiate cortico-thalamocortical connectional loops. However, the thalamus also contains projection GABAergic neurons that do not extend axons toward the cortex. Here, we have harnessed recent insight into the development of the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv) to specifically target and manipulate thalamic projection GABAergic neurons in female and male mice. Our results show that thalamic GABAergic neurons of the IGL and LGv receive retinal input from diverse classes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) but not from the M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) type. We describe the synergistic role of the photoreceptor melanopsin and the thalamic neurons of the IGL/LGv in circadian entrainment to dim light. We identify a requirement for the thalamic IGL/LGv neurons in the rapid changes in vigilance states associated with circadian light transitions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv) are part of the extended circadian system and mediate some nonimage-forming visual functions. Here, we show that each of these structures has a thalamic (dorsal) as well as prethalamic (ventral) developmental origin. We map the retinal input to thalamus-derived cells in the IGL/LGv complex and discover that while RGC input is dominant, this is not likely to originate from M1ipRGCs. We implicate thalamic cells in the IGL/LGv in vigilance state transitions at circadian light changes and in overt behavioral entrainment to dim light, the latter exacerbated by concomitant loss of melanopsin expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nociceptive Stimuli Activate the Hypothalamus-Habenula Circuit to Inhibit the Mesolimbic Reward System and Cocaine-Seeking Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nociceptive signals interact with various regions of the brain, including those involved in physical sensation, reward, cognition, and emotion. Emerging evidence points to a role of nociception in the modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. The mechanism by which nociception affects dopamine (DA) signaling and reward is unclear. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the lateral habenula (LHb) receive somatosensory inputs and are structurally connected with the mesolimbic DA system. Here, we show that the LH&ndash;LHb pathway is necessary for nociceptive modulation of this system using male Sprague Dawley rats. Our extracellular single-unit recordings and head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed that nociceptive stimulation by tail pinch excited LHb and LH neurons, which was inhibited by chemical lesion of the LH. Tail pinch increased activity of GABA neurons in ventral tegmental area, decreased the extracellular DA level in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell in intact rats, and reduced cocaine-increased DA concentration, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 22 and 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH&ndash;LHb pathway. Our findings suggest that nociceptive stimulation recruits the LH&ndash;LHb pathway to inhibit mesolimbic DA system and drug reinstatement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The LHb and the LH have been implicated in processing nociceptive signals and modulating DA release in the mesolimbic DA system. Here, we show that the LH&ndash;LHb pathway is critical for nociception-induced modulation of mesolimbic DA release and cocaine reinstatement. Nociceptive stimulation alleviates extracellular DA release in the mesolimbic DA system, cocaine-induced psychomotor activities, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviors through the LH&ndash;LHb pathway. These findings provide novel evidence for sensory modulation of the mesolimbic DA system and drug addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathological Slow-Wave Activity and Impaired Working Memory Binding in Post-Traumatic Amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Associative binding is key to normal memory function and is transiently disrupted during periods of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Electrophysiological abnormalities, including low-frequency activity, are common following TBI. Here, we investigate associative memory binding during PTA and test the hypothesis that misbinding is caused by pathological slowing of brain activity disrupting cortical communication. Thirty acute moderate to severe TBI patients (25 males; 5 females) and 26 healthy controls (20 males; 6 females) were tested with a precision working memory paradigm requiring the association of object and location information. Electrophysiological effects of TBI were assessed using resting-state EEG in a subsample of 17 patients and 21 controls. PTA patients showed abnormalities in working memory function and made significantly more misbinding errors than patients who were not in PTA and controls. The distribution of localization responses was abnormally biased by the locations of nontarget items for patients in PTA, suggesting a specific impairment of object and location binding. Slow-wave activity was increased following TBI. Increases in the -&alpha; ratio indicative of an increase in low-frequency power specifically correlated with binding impairment in working memory. Connectivity changes in TBI did not correlate with binding impairment. Working memory and electrophysiological abnormalities normalized at 6 month follow-up. These results show that patients in PTA show high rates of misbinding that are associated with a pathological shift toward lower-frequency oscillations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we remember what was where? The mechanism by which information (e.g., object and location) is integrated in working memory is a central question for cognitive neuroscience. Following significant head injury, many patients will experience a period of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) during which this associative binding is disrupted. This may be because of electrophysiological changes in the brain. Using a precision working memory test and resting-state EEG, we show that PTA patients demonstrate impaired binding ability, and this is associated with a shift toward slower-frequency activity on EEG. Abnormal EEG connectivity was observed but was not specific to PTA or binding ability. These findings contribute to both our mechanistic understanding of working memory binding and PTA pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Seeing Social: A Neural Signature for Conscious Perception of Social Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions&mdash;that is, whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction&mdash;are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of subjective (or conscious) social perception using data from the Human Connectome Project in which participants (<I>n</I> = 1049; 486 men, 562 women) viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers' own reports of "Social" or "Non-social" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as "Social" by some but "Non-social" by others to control for visual input. Behaviorally, observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (vs non-social); and neurally, observer reports (compared with experimenter labels) explained more variance in activity across much of the brain. Using "Unsure" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus non-social content diverged early in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Finally, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias toward "Social" and an inverse relationship with activity in default mode and visual association areas while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Simple animations involving two or more geometric shapes have been used as a gold standard to understand social cognition and impairments therein. Yet, experimenter-assigned labels of what is social versus non-social are frequently used as a ground truth, despite the fact that percepts of such ambiguous social stimuli are highly subjective. Here, we used behavioral and fMRI data from a large sample of neurotypical individuals to show that participants' responses reveal subtle behavioral biases, help us study neural responses to social content more precisely, and covary with internalizing trait scores. Our findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of considering observer reports in studying behavioral and neural dynamics of social perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Environment Symmetry Drives a Multidirectional Code in Rat Retrosplenial Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>We investigated how environment symmetry shapes the neural processing of direction by recording directionally tuned retrosplenial neurons in male Lister hooded rats exploring multicompartment environments that had different levels of global rotational symmetry. Our hypothesis built on prior observations of twofold symmetry in the directional tuning curves of rats in a globally twofold-symmetric environment. To test whether environment symmetry was the relevant factor shaping the directional responses, here we deployed the same apparatus (two connected rectangular boxes) plus one with fourfold symmetry (a 2 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 2 array of connected square boxes) and one with onefold symmetry (a circular open-field arena). Consistent with our hypothesis we found many neurons with tuning curve symmetries that mirrored these environment symmetries, having twofold, fourfold, or onefold symmetric tuning, respectively. Some cells expressed this pattern only globally (across the whole environment), maintaining singular tuning curves in each subcompartment. However, others also expressed it locally within each subcompartment. Because multidirectionality has not been reported in naive rats in single environmental compartments, this suggests an experience-dependent effect of global environment symmetry on local firing symmetry. An intermingled population of directional neurons were classic head direction cells with globally referenced directional tuning. These cells were electrophysiologically distinct, with narrower tuning curves and a burstier firing pattern. Thus, retrosplenial directional neurons can simultaneously encode overall head direction and local head direction (relative to compartment layout). Furthermore, they can learn about global environment symmetry and express this locally. This may be important for the encoding of environment structure beyond immediate perceptual reach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated how environment symmetry shapes the neural code for space by recording directionally tuned neurons from the retrosplenial cortex of rats exploring single- or multicompartment environments having onefold, twofold, or fourfold rotational symmetry. We found that many cells expressed a symmetry in their head direction tuning curves that matched the corresponding global environment symmetry, indicating plasticity of their directional tuning. They were also electrophysiologically distinct from canonical head directional cells. Notably, following exploration of the global space, many multidirectionally tuned neurons encoded global environment symmetry, even in local subcompartments. Our results suggest that multidirectional head direction codes contribute to the cognitive mapping of the complex structure of multicompartmented spaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attention to Stimuli of Learned versus Innate Biological Value Relies on Separate Neural Systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural bases of attention, a set of neural processes that promote behavioral selection, is a subject of intense investigation. In humans, rewarded cues influence attention, even when those cues are irrelevant to the current task. Because the amygdala plays a role in reward processing, and the activity of amygdala neurons has been linked to spatial attention, we reasoned that the amygdala may be essential for attending to rewarded images. To test this possibility, we used an attentional capture task, which provides a quantitative measure of attentional bias. Specifically, we compared reaction times (RTs) of adult male rhesus monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions and unoperated controls as they made a saccade away from a high- or low-value rewarded image to a peripheral target. We predicted that: (1) RTs will be longer for high- compared with low-value images, revealing attentional capture by rewarded stimuli; and (2) relative to controls, monkeys with amygdala lesions would exhibit shorter RT for high-value images. For comparison, we assessed the same groups of monkeys for attentional capture by images of predators and conspecifics, categories thought to have innate biological value. In performing the attentional capture task, all monkeys were slowed more by high-value relative to low-value rewarded images. Contrary to our prediction, amygdala lesions failed to disrupt this effect. When presented with images of predators and conspecifics, however, monkeys with amygdala lesions showed significantly diminished attentional capture relative to controls. Thus, separate neural pathways are responsible for allocating attention to stimuli with learned versus innate value.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Valuable objects attract attention. The amygdala is known to contribute to reward processing and the encoding of object reward value. We therefore examined whether the amygdala is necessary for allocating attention to rewarded objects. For comparison, we assessed the amygdala's contribution to attending to objects with innate biological value: predators and conspecifics. We found that the macaque amygdala is necessary for directing attention to images with innate biological value, but not for directing attention to recently learned reward-predictive images. These findings indicate that the amygdala makes selective contributions to attending to valuable objects. The data are relevant to mental health disorders, such as social anxiety disorders and small animal phobias, that arise from biased attention to select categories of objects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin and APP Regulate Synaptic Kainate Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Kainate receptors (KARs) form a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors that regulate the activity of neuronal networks by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (APP/PS1) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with -secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP. Overall, our data suggest that APP stabilizes KARs at synapses, possibly through a transsynaptic mechanism, and this interaction is under the control the -secretase proteolytic activity of presenilin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic impairment correlates strongly with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. Kainate receptors (KARs), which form the third family of iGluRs, represent an underestimated actor in the regulation of neuronal circuits and have not yet been examined in the context of AD. Here we provide evidence that synaptic KARs are markedly impaired in a mouse model of AD. Additional experiments indicate that the -secretase activity of presenilin acting on the amyloid precursor protein controls synaptic expression of KAR. This study clearly indicates that KARs should be taken into consideration whenever addressing synaptic dysfunction and related cognitive deficits in the context of AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Absence of Parkin Does Not Promote Dopamine or Mitochondrial Dysfunction in PolgAD257A/D257A Mitochondrial Mutator Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In this study, we generated a transgenic model by crossing germline Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice with PolgA<sup>D257A</sup> mice, an established model of premature aging and mitochondrial stress. We hypothesized that loss of Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> in PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice would exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to loss of dopamine neurons and nigral-striatal specific neurobehavioral motor dysfunction. We found that aged Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> male and female mice exhibited severe behavioral deficits, nonspecific to the nigral-striatal pathway, with neither dopaminergic neurodegeneration nor reductions in striatal dopamine. We saw no difference in expression levels of nuclear-encoded subunits of mitochondrial markers and mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities, although we did observe substantial reductions in mitochondrial-encoded COX41I, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a result of PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mtDNA mutations. Expression levels of mitophagy markers LC3I/LC3II remained unchanged between cohorts, suggesting no overt mitophagy defects. Expression levels of the parkin substrates, VDAC, NLRP3, and AIMP2 remained unchanged, suggesting no parkin dysfunction. In summary, we were unable to observe dopaminergic neurodegeneration with corresponding nigral-striatal neurobehavioral deficits, nor Parkin or mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice. These findings support a lack of synergism of Parkin loss on mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of mitochondrial deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Producing a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is etiologically relevant, recapitulates clinical hallmarks, and exhibits reproducible results is crucial to understanding the underlying pathology and in developing disease-modifying therapies. Here, we show that Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice, a previously reported PD mouse model, fails to reproduce a Parkinsonian phenotype. We show that these mice do not display dopaminergic neurodegeneration nor nigral-striatal-dependent motor deficits. Furthermore, we report that Parkin loss does not synergize with mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice are not a reliable model for PD and adds to a growing body of work demonstrating that Parkin loss does not synergize with mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of mitochondrial deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decreased Modulation of Population Correlations in Auditory Cortex Is Associated with Decreased Auditory Detection Performance in Old Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) affects one-third of the world's population. One hallmark of presbycusis is difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Presbycusis can be separated into two components: the aging ear and the aging brain. To date, the role of the aging brain in presbycusis is not well understood. Activity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) during a behavioral task is because of a combination of responses representing the acoustic stimuli, attentional gain, and behavioral choice. Disruptions in any of these aspects can lead to decreased auditory processing. To investigate how these distinct components are disrupted in aging, we performed <I>in vivo</I> 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in both male and female mice (<I>Thy1-GCaMP6s</I> <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> <I>CBA/CaJ</I> mice) that retain peripheral hearing into old age. We imaged A1 neurons of young adult (2-6 months) and old mice (16-24 months) during a tone detection task in broadband noise. While young mice performed well, old mice performed worse at low signal-to-noise ratios. Calcium imaging showed that old animals have increased prestimulus activity, reduced attentional gain, and increased noise correlations. Increased correlations in old animals exist regardless of cell tuning and behavioral outcome, and these correlated networks exist over a much larger portion of cortical space. Neural decoding techniques suggest that this prestimulus activity is predictive of old animals making early responses. Together, our results suggest a model in which old animals have higher and more correlated prestimulus activity and cannot fully suppress this activity, leading to the decreased representation of targets among distracting stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging inhibits the ability to hear clearly in noisy environments. We show that the aging auditory cortex is unable to fully suppress its responses to background noise. During an auditory behavior, fewer neurons were suppressed in the old relative to young animals, which leads to higher prestimulus activity and more false alarms. We show that this excess activity additionally leads to increased correlations between neurons, reducing the amount of relevant stimulus information in the auditory cortex. Future work identifying the lost circuits that are responsible for proper background suppression could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies to preserve auditory processing ability into old age.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of cytosine conversion methods for whole-genome DNA methylation profiling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: DNA methylation, the most common epigenetic modification, is defined as the removal or addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases. Studying DNA methylation provides insight into the regulation of gene expression, transposon mobility, genomic stability, and genomic imprinting. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling (WGDM) is a powerful tool to find DNA methylation. This technique combines standard whole-genome sequencing methodology (e.g., Illumina high-throughput sequencing) with additional steps where unmethylated cytosine is converted to uracil. However, factors such as low cytosine conversion efficiency and inadequate DNA recovery during sample preparation oftentimes render poor-quality data. It is therefore imperative to benchmark sample preparation protocols to increase sequencing data quality and reduce false positives in methylation detection. Methods: A survey analysis was performed to investigate the efficiency of the following commercially available cytosine conversion kits when coupled with the NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB): Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation™ kit (hereafter known as Zymo Conversion kit), QIAGEN EpiTect Bisulfite kit (hereafter known as QIAGEN Conversion kit), and NEBNext® Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module (hereafter known as NEB EM-seq kit). Input DNA was derived from soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) leaf tissue. Results: Of those tested, the QIAGEN Conversion kit provided the best sample recovery and the highest number of sequencing reads, whereas the Zymo Conversion kit had the best cytosine conversion efficiency and the least duplication. The sequence library obtained with the NEB EM-seq kit had the highest mapping efficiency (percentage of reads mapped to the genome). The data quality (defined by Phred score) and methylated cytosine call were similar between kits. Conclusions: This study offers the groundwork for selecting an effective DNA methylation detection kit for crop genome research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors and mortality outcomes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli bacteremia: A retrospective cohort study from two Indonesian referral hospitals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) can lead to bloodstream infection and subsequent sepsis which increases morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of risk factors of infection by ESBL-producing E. coli is important as it can decrease inappropriate antibiotic use and mortality rates. This study aimed to identify the risk factors and mortality of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included inpatients with confirmed E. coli blood culture examinations from two referral hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data suspected as risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia (utilization of medical devices, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, history of hospitalization, and history of antibiotic therapy) were collected for analysis. Clinical profiles and independent risk factors of ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia associated mortality were also evaluated. Results: A total of 116 subjects were analyzed with 81% aged ≥18 years old. The most common source of infection was the gastrointestinal and intra-abdominal tracts. Malignancy as comorbidity was present in 46.6% subjects. Significant risk factors for developing ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia were history of antibiotic therapy and utilization of medical devices. The proportion of mortality in ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia was 55.7% with age and sepsis as its independent risk factors. Conclusions: History of antibiotic therapy and utilization of medical devices were significant risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia. The proportion of mortality in ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia patients was 55.7% with its independent risk factors being age and sepsis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis led by empagliflozin: A case report and literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of medications that have been approved for the treatment of heart failure (HF) in patients with and without type-2 diabetes mellitus. It is important to be aware of the likely side effects of SGLT2i for their optimal use and enhanced patient safety. One such rare but potential side effect is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA). Objective: We present a case report of EDKA, in a patient who was started on empagliflozin – one of the SGLT2i – highlighting its presenting signs and symptoms, pertinent laboratory findings, differential diagnosis, treatment and outcome. To strengthen our findings and hypothesis, we conducted a literature review of other cases that used SGLT2i and found similar complications. This case report with review can help recognize the serious, potentially life-threatening complications of the new class of medication SGLT2i that has been incorporated into the current practice, and also help to take appropriate steps to mitigate its adverse effects and improve overall health outcomes in our patients.  Conclusions: SGLT2i are increasingly used because of their favorable effects on mortality in the chronic HF patients along with its benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. A potential underdiagnosed adverse effect of SGLT2i use is diabetic ketoacidosis in a setting of normal blood glucose levels. Thus, it is reasonable to be cognizant of its side effects to prevent any untoward events in a timely manner.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainability of quality of life investments based on the digital transformation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this paper, the problem of sustainability of investment activity in the direction of the high yield investment program is considered. In these financial instruments, large amounts of money are accumulated, consisting of contributions from the vast majority of the population. For example, pension funds inherent in most developed countries, insurance institutions, etc., can be indicated. Accordingly, the social significance of their activities and the impact on the quality of life of all segments of the population increase. Methods: This article outlines the methods and results aimed at the digital transformation of methods for forecasting long-term institutional investments. The authors use the method of mathematical modeling of the dynamics considering that the sustainability calculation must assume that the life cycle of citizens providing contributions is limited. The parameters of the distribution of the duration of the accumulation phase over the array of people and the time of life in the subsequent period are known. For mathematical modeling, the researchers divide the players by the time they have been present on the market. Results: The authors have developed a mathematical model in the form of a set of algorithms for calculating the sustainability of long-term institutional investments with reference to life quality indicators. Conclusions: The need to develop a methodology for assessing sustainability is dictated by the increased role of digital technologies and the ability to receive the most relevant information for analysis online.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian nowcasting with leading indicators applied to COVID-19 fatalities in Sweden</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fanny Bergström, Felix Günther, Michael Höhle, Tom Britton</p>

The real-time analysis of infectious disease surveillance data is essential in obtaining situational awareness about the current dynamics of a major public health event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis of e.g., time-series of reported cases or fatalities is complicated by reporting delays that lead to under-reporting of the complete number of events for the most recent time points. This can lead to misconceptions by the interpreter, for instance the media or the public, as was the case with the time-series of reported fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Nowcasting methods provide real-time estimates of the complete number of events using the incomplete time-series of currently reported events and information about the reporting delays from the past. In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian nowcasting approach applied to COVID-19-related fatalities in Sweden. We incorporate additional information in the form of time-series of number of reported cases and ICU admissions as leading signals. We demonstrate with a retrospective evaluation that the inclusion of ICU admissions as a leading signal improved the nowcasting performance of case fatalities for COVID-19 in Sweden compared to existing methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Population coding strategies in human tactile afferents</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulia Corniani, Miguel A. Casal, Stefano Panzeri, Hannes P. Saal</p>

Sensory information is conveyed by populations of neurons, and coding strategies cannot always be deduced when considering individual neurons. Moreover, information coding depends on the number of neurons available and on the composition of the population when multiple classes with different response properties are available. Here, we study population coding in human tactile afferents by employing a recently developed simulator of mechanoreceptor firing activity. First, we highlight the interplay of afferents within each class. We demonstrate that the optimal afferent density to convey maximal information depends on both the tactile feature under consideration and the afferent class. Second, we find that information is spread across different classes for all tactile features and that each class encodes both redundant and complementary information with respect to the other afferent classes. Specifically, combining information from multiple afferent classes improves information transmission and is often more efficient than increasing the density of afferents from the same class. Finally, we examine the importance of temporal and spatial contributions, respectively, to the joint spatiotemporal code. On average, destroying temporal information is more destructive than removing spatial information, but the importance of either depends on the stimulus feature analysed. Overall, our results suggest that both optimal afferent innervation densities and the composition of the population depend in complex ways on the tactile features in question, potentially accounting for the variety in which tactile peripheral populations are assembled in different regions across the body.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing T cell receptor repertoires using optimal transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Branden J. Olson, Stefan A. Schattgen, Paul G. Thomas, Philip Bradley, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

The complexity of entire T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires makes their comparison a difficult but important task. Current methods of TCR repertoire comparison can incur a high loss of distributional information by considering overly simplistic sequence- or repertoire-level characteristics. Optimal transport methods form a suitable approach for such comparison given some distance or metric between values in the sample space, with appealing theoretical and computational properties. In this paper we introduce a nonparametric approach to comparing empirical TCR repertoires that applies the Sinkhorn distance, a fast, contemporary optimal transport method, and a recently-created distance between TCRs called TCRdist. We show that our methods identify meaningful differences between samples from distinct TCR distributions for several case studies, and compete with more complicated methods despite minimal modeling assumptions and a simpler pipeline.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational epitope mapping of class I fusion proteins using low complexity supervised learning methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marion F. S. Fischer, James E. Crowe, Jens Meiler</p>

Antibody epitope mapping of viral proteins plays a vital role in understanding immune system mechanisms of protection. In the case of class I viral fusion proteins, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and protein stabilization techniques have highlighted the importance of cryptic or ‘alternative’ conformations that expose epitopes targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies. Thorough epitope mapping of such metastable conformations is difficult but is critical for understanding sites of vulnerability in class I fusion proteins that occur as transient conformational states during viral attachment and fusion. We introduce a novel method Accelerated class I fusion protein Epitope Mapping (AxIEM) that accounts for fusion protein flexibility to improve out-of-sample prediction of discontinuous antibody epitopes. Harnessing data from previous experimental epitope mapping efforts of several class I fusion proteins, we demonstrate that accuracy of epitope prediction depends on residue environment and allows for the prediction of conformation-dependent antibody target residues. We also show that AxIEM can identify common epitopes and provide structural insights for the development and rational design of vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pannexin 1 activity in astroglia sets hippocampal neuronal network patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Flora Vasile, Elena Dossi, Julien Moulard, Pascal Ezan, Laure Lecoin, Martine Cohen-Salmon, Philippe Mailly, Marc Le Bert, Isabelle Couillin, Alexis Bemelmans, Nathalie Rouach</p>

Astroglial release of molecules is thought to actively modulate neuronal activity, but the nature, release pathway, and cellular targets of these neuroactive molecules are still unclear. Pannexin 1, expressed by neurons and astrocytes, form nonselective large pore channels that mediate extracellular exchange of molecules. The functional relevance of these channels has been mostly studied in brain tissues, without considering their specific role in different cell types, or in neurons. Thus, our knowledge of astroglial pannexin 1 regulation and its control of neuronal activity remains very limited, largely due to the lack of tools targeting these channels in a cell-specific way. We here show that astroglial pannexin 1 expression in mice is developmentally regulated and that its activation is activity-dependent. Using astrocyte-specific molecular tools, we found that astroglial-specific pannexin 1 channel activation, in contrast to pannexin 1 activation in all cell types, selectively and negatively regulates hippocampal networks, with their disruption inducing a drastic switch from bursts to paroxysmal activity. This decrease in neuronal excitability occurs via an unconventional astroglial mechanism whereby pannexin 1 channel activity drives purinergic signaling-mediated regulation of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN)-gated channels. Our findings suggest that astroglial pannexin 1 channel activation serves as a negative feedback mechanism crucial for the inhibition of hippocampal neuronal networks.

                Background: Dermatophytes are the most common superficial fungal infections worldwide and are treated with prescribed regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, or with weekly doses of fluconazole. Dermatologists are increasingly encountering treatment failures, and experts suggest that standard treatment regimens are not applicable anymore. We planned an open-label study to evaluate the results of fluconazole 150 mg daily for 8 weeks in patients with tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Methods: Patients were enrolled from the La’Mer Clinic, Mumbai, India. We included adult subjects with uncomplicated dermatophytosis confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Pregnancy, poor renal function, and recent exposure to anti-fungal therapy were exclusion criteria. Patients were reviewed on days 14, 28 and 56. The treating doctor scored the severity of erythema, scaling, and pruritus on a four-point scale: absent, mild, moderate, and severe. Of 107 subjects screened, 100 were finally included in the study. Eleven were lost to follow up and one subject withdrew consent. Results: The site of disease was body alone in 29, groin alone in 7, and both body and groin in 64 cases. At 5 weeks, 98%, 100%, and 97% of patients had no scaling, erythema, and pruritus, respectively. Skin scrapings showed 100% mycological cure. In one patient the alanine transaminase level rose from 54.9 to 100.2 U/L, and qualified as a grade 1 adverse event not requiring intervention. No other significant adverse events were noted. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fluconazole 150 mg daily for eight weeks effectively treats dermatophytosis. This regimen is safe and well-tolerated even in patients with co-morbidities. Fluconazole is about eight times less expensive than itraconazole or terbinafine and may be the preferred therapy. Registration: The trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry, India (Registration number CTRI/2020/06/026110) on 24 June 2020. FDC Company, India, provided financial support for the study.
